Notes: rey & finn figure out the hero business. and also fall in space love. also on tumblr: http://janicerands.tumblr.com/post/153683999113 this is like half a rey & finn character study and half a ship vid, and also functions as a rey/finn supercut of the movie how much fun did i have editing the "fuck kylo up" segment? too much possibly. meta notes for anyone who wants them: i tried to give both of them equal weight in the song, but rey wins by a smidgen by virtue of being the main character! i love the theory that finn is force sensitive too, but it's just not as important for his arc of facing his fear of the first order. but also, he was always a hero, he literally doesn't hesitate to start running to rey's aid one second after nearly dying of thirst in the desert. amazing. rey's arc is more deeply tied to family and history and so, presumably with how Extraâ„¢ the skywalkers are with their family drama, she's in the mix somewhere too. i wasn't pointing to any lineage in particular here, just probably someone Plot Important. i wanted to emphasize how fucked up her trust system has gotten, but also, at heart, she loves so much.
