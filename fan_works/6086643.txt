"Him?! Out of anyone?! Y/N please, I don't agree with this, Ren is ruthless. I don't want him to hurt you. I do not-" "Brother, calm down. Please. It's not a big deal. He hasn't done anyth-" "Yet!" He interrupts you. You turn to him. "Damn you! I understand you're worried but loosen up! I know you're my brother and you care about me but you gotta let me live my life!" Hux storms out after that. You roll your eyes and let out a sigh. -- "Ren!" The red head yells at the Sith. "General." Kylo replies. "What are your intentions toward my sister?" He asks, with a straight face. "All good things, I promise you. I won't do-" "You are unpredictable! You could lash out at anytime. My sister is my family. You harm her in anyway, I promise you, you will regret it for the rest of your life. Y/N is very dear to me. She deserves all the goodness in the galaxy and I believe that you cannot give that to her." Kylo bows his head. "You're right I can't." Hux continues, "She deserves the best. You are lucky that she has eyes for you. I am not and will not be happy about this, but I will be watching you closely. If anything happens," he lets out a deep breath, "I will find out." Kylo nods. "I understand, sir." Hux leaves Kylo with his thoughts. "Be good to her, Ren." Notes: the-imagines-awaken.tumblr.com theaidenellis.tumblr.com
