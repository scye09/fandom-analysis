Another long day at Starkiller Base High……..at least for Mitaka. “Get rekt bitch!” Kylo Ren shouted while shoving the young dark haired nerdy man into a locker. Blood poured from Mitaka’s forehead and onto the tile floor. “Ren why?”” he whined, beginning to cry. “I thought we were friends?” Befire he could respond, Armitage walked by, glancing down at the weak boy before him. \ “mm, what do we have here?” he murmured, swiping a few drops of blood from the locker. He licked the blood off his fingers slowly, scaring Mitaka. Then, he noticed Kylo’s expression. Is he?? No, not even Ren is that sick. “I should probably go to the nurse or something” Mitaka said, interrupting Hux’s suspicious thoughts. “Yes, go,” Hux replied, flicking his wrist towards the direcention of the nurse’s station. Mitaka ran off hurriedly, leaving Ren and Hux alone in the hallway. “Why do we use Mitaka as our punching bag anyway?” Kylo asked, trying not to notice a drop of blood in the corner of Hux’s mouth. He’s literally bloodthirsty, Ren thought. And yet he’s the one we’ve ended up with as leader of our group. “Mitaka’s family have been servants of my family’s for years,” Hux replied. “Besides, my father built this school. It’s not as if I’m going to be in any trouble. You want to avoid trouble, don’t you Ren?” “Of course” Kylo replied, narrowing his eyes. Hux was up to something. He always was. “We should actually get to class.” Hux snorted. “As if it matters. I’m only here because it’s required that I get an official education. But we all know I’m smarter than everyone who works here anyway.” “Your dad works here,” Kylo pointed out. Hux looked conflicted for a moment, then huffed. “Whatever. Let’s go.” Kylo shrugged—this was Hux’s world and he was just along for the ride. But soon he would have to make a choice.
