It isn't clear how they are chosen. Is there a lottery? A quota? Are there genetic markers that indicate who will be a better soldier? Loyal families give up their children. Loyal to what?

Some people talk about mercy. Is it mercy to hold your child before they're taken away, raised to be a killer? Or to have them stolen when all you've known of their life is pain?
