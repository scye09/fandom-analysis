Poe was greeted with Finn’s laughter when he came out of the fresher. The pilot smiled at the sound, stepping out into their shared bedroom. “What’s so fu..?” His eyes widened and his mouth snapped shut when he saw what Finn was looking at on his data pad. Looking up, Finn showed the image, raising an eyebrow. “Really?” he asked, gesturing to the recruitment image of Poe with his squadron around him in flight. “And how much did your recruitment go up when this was made?” he teased. “A lot actually,” Poe confessed. “It was made as a joke but ended up working.” Finn laughed and pulled Poe down to sit beside him. “You look so dashing and handsome,” he noted. “Don’t I always?” “Not always.” Poe deflated. “Oh…” Finn snorted and put his data pad down, turning to face Poe properly now. “The Rebellion’s best pilot,” he cooed, “a literal poster boy.” “But I’m your poster boy,” he corrected. He hummed and pressed their foreheads together. “Yeah, you are.”
