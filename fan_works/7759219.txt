He noted the sound of glass cracking and he tilted his head to the side, listening to someone softly curse before giving up, smashing the glass completely before barking for another drink. “Is something upsetting you?” he asked. Ben was silent. He glanced over at his bodyguard's blind brother and rolled his eyes. “How do you figure?” he asked. “You broke your glass.” “I always break my glasses.” “Not like that.” He snorted but sat up a little straighter on his stool. He took his glass from the bartender and drank half of it before setting it down again. “My mother's friends and their insufferable spawn think I don't notice how they look at me,” he snarled.
