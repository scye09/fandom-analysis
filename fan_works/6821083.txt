He found Poe out in one of the garages, working on his X-Wing as BB-8 helpfully rolled around and gave him tips in their Binary language. Finn approached, clearing his throat to catch the pilot's attention. “Hey...” “Hey!” Poe chirped. He wiped his hands with a cloth before stepping forward, pulling Finn into his arms for a hug. “What's up?” “I've been doing some thinking.” “Oh?” Poe tilted his head, looking Finn over. “Thinking about something important it looks like,” he noted. Finn nodded his head, smiling down at BB-8 fondly as the droid pushed over a stool for him to sit down on. He sat down and watched as Poe pulled up a stool for himself. “I was thinking about...our relationship.” “Oh...” “I was wondering if...you wanted to take it to a more...sexual direction?” Finn asked. Poe blinked. He had been worried that Finn would talk about something else but this...this he could work with. He smiled at him, nodding his head. “Sure I could give it a try!” he chirped. “Give it a try?” “Yeah!” “You mean you've never...” Poe shrugged his shoulders. “I've never done anything sexual with another person before,” he said, “most people assume I have just because of where I'm from. A lot of people think people from the Yavins and similar planets are overly sexual for some reason.” “I mean...wait what?” Finn asked with a frown. “It's dumb right?” “Why would your sexuality and sexual experiences have anything to do with what planet you're from?” “I don't know!” “That's stupid.” “I know!” The two laughed then, shaking their heads before settling down again. “So...sex...” “Only if you want to,” Finn added. Poe considered the offer, smiling as he nudged him in the side with his elbow. “I suppose I could give it a try if you're willing to help me. Just don't laugh if I get anything wrong, okay?” Finn smiled and kissed him on the cheek. “I would never laugh at you, Poe.”
