Leia has felt true gratitude for the presence of the Force exactly three times: it helped her save Luke from Vader and Bespin, though she would not make this connection until later; it brought her Luke, even after they’d already become fast friends—a reunion she’d never known she’d longed for; and it instigated the tangled tapestry of her time with Han, who would always orbit her heart if not her body. So Leia cannot honestly say that she has had no use for the Force in her life. But Luke is gone. Han is gone, and their son nearly so. Sitting inside the rebel base—a place she has occupied in one form or another for the majority of her life—as personnel run and talk around and at her, she allows herself to absorb the grief of violent separation (permanent) from Han (from their son) and let it sink into her bones. Leia cannot honestly say that she has had no use for the presence of the Force in her life. Only that the Force has had no use for her. end
