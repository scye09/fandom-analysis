There are too many voices in my head... I hear them clear as day. They whisper to me...Incompetent Klutz, you deserved the hit. At night they tell me...You are a failure. Idiot...Useless. After every mission they yell at me...You can't do anything right. Time to increase your training, no rest, no more playing around. While I mediate they laugh at me...You do know everyone hates you...Malice lurks everywhere, around every corner, sharp words and tones makes your brain feel as if on fire. While I sleep the voices argue among themselves, then shove the knowledge that my parents regret having me into my dreams. As I lay and watch the sky, listening to the planet cry, cold, I hear them...real and ...not in my head, looming over me with red hair " ....You do know you are talking to yourself? " The voices in my head can come out of my mouth...with my own voice.
