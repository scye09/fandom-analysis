I am sorry to say that i am deleting my account due to personal reasons. To those who followed my works, I apologize for not carrying them through. I thank everyone who read one of my stories, because you all have carried me through some darker times. To those who wrote positively inspiring things; don't worry, I'll still be around. Writing is hard, I'll make no mistake, but you guys on this site do it best. Never stop putting words to page; you encourage everyone around you. -Kelsoc
