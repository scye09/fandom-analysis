Chapter 4: Love Bree was not ready. She was confident she was. She was very wrong. Kylo ravaged her body like no other. He would tease her by playing with her boobs and lickng every inch of her body. She would moan very loud but he would cover her mouth so no one would hear them. After she would quiet down, he would lightly finger her and play with her clit. This drove her absolutely insane. Please use your mouth daddy. Please stop teasing me like this. Hearing her beg was magical to him. So he granted her wish and went down on her. She tangled her fingers in his dark curls and held onto his head like her life depended on it. He enjoyed the this so much, his tongue entered the moist hot cave. She was so close. Her eyes were beginning to roll Into the back of her head. He knew she was close so he stopped dead in his tracks. This made bree cry out a little in disappointment. He loved seeing someone bend to his will on their own. It made him feel all powerful. That's when he undid his belt. Pulled down his pants. And thrusted into her. Bree’s body arched into his. Her head flew back in pure passion. His thrusts became more and more intense as they both came closer to their climax. Scream my name kylo said in between grunts. Scream daddy's name. Bree’s release was so near. It kept coming and coming. Until she did cum and she screamed his name. Her body shook as a wave of ecstasy washed over her. Kylo also hit his climax and collapsed on her. They were both breathing as if they ran 20 miles. Kylo lifted his head up and planted a light kiss on bree. I love you baby girl. I really do.
