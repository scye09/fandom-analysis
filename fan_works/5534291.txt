“You got a family? Got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend?” "Do you ?" Finn stays silent, his mouth agape. He really wasn't expecting that. "Ah-well..." "What?" Rey looks at him seriously, raising an eyebrow. "I don't think I could count someone I met today as a boyfriend, could I?" Rey stares at his blushing face, then rolls her eyes. "Men." She mutters under her breath. "What? Did you say something?" Finn asks, his usual confused demeanor returning. "Nothing, come on." Finn follows her, knowing full well what he said was awkward. It wasn't his fault that pilot he met was handsome, and interesting, and had a gorgeous smile... "Finn!" "Oh right, I'm coming!"
