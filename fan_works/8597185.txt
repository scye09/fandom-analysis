“Your ship,” Poe marvels, leaning on a workbench, “has a dancefloor.” Johnny grins, sarcasm glinting in his eyes. “Too bad she’s a tugboat .” Poe winces, feigning injury. “I’m sorry! I take it back. She’s beautiful.” Johnny cocks his head, eyes closing. “Gotta apologize to the lady, not me.” “Lucy!” Poe claps his hands together and falls to his knees, begging apology. “You’re gorgeous. No snubfighter could dream of such perfection. I’m jealous!” “Apology accepted,” Lucy states, music starting, “after you dance.” “Done.” Poe promises. Johnny takes his hand. “Deal.” They dance ‘til they’re sober and the ship hums with approval.
