Kylo Ren was odd. Captain Phasma had come to this conclusion within the first few hours of their meeting. From his speech patterns, to the way he carried himself, to the cracked jewel in the hilt of the lightsaber he carried. But he was Leader Snoke’s apprentice, and far be it from her to question the Supreme Leader’s decisions. Even General Hux did not have that privilege. The second time Phasma crossed paths with Kylo Ren was during their mission briefing for the Ottegan assault. He’d arrived late, all long strides and billowing capes, still wearing that mask of his. That in itself was not unusual – it was rare that she and her troopers were not in full armor, which, of course, included their helmets. But Ren’s eyes, eyes she’d yet to see , could burn through steel and chrome. She wondered if Darth Vader had those same eyes, if the Supreme Leader’s gaze could pierce through armor. She hoped she would not have the opportunity to find out. The mission itself went surprisingly smoothly considering their quarry, Lor San Tekka, was long gone. For all his quirks, Ren was a capable warrior – no, a knight, she reminded herself. Her leg still throbbed after he cauterized the wound with his lightsaber, but she appreciated the gesture. He leaned over as she folded herself into the seat next to him in the cramped shuttle. “You smell really nice.” Yes, Kylo Ren was most definitely odd. Although her thin smile was obscured by her helmet, she felt sure he was aware of it. “I had heard there’s a vogue for blood, sweat, and ashes this year.” “I was referring to your armor polish. It has a more pleasant aroma than the standard product.” “Oh- thank you, Sir.” “You’re welcome, Captain.” Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 2 of the Far Above the Moon series Next Work →
