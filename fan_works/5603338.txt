like you knew me and all the things i couldn't say // listen on 8tracks together / the xx You said you don't have to speak I can hear you I can feel all the things you've ever felt before I said it's been a long time Since someone looked at me that way It's like you knew me And all the things I couldn't say in for the kill / la roux We can fight our desires, But when we start making fires We get ever so hot Whether we like it or not They say we can love who we trust But what is love without lust Let's go to war to make peace Let's be cold to create heat I hope in darkness we can see And you're not blinded by the light from me recover / chvrches I'll give you one more chance to say We can change or part ways And you take what you need And you don't need me Blow by blow Honest in every way I know You appear To face the decision I know you fear running up that hill / placebo You don't want to hurt me But see how deep the bullet lies Unaware I'm tearing you asunder Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts Is there so much hate for the ones we love? Tell me, we both matter, don't we? You, it's you and me It's you and me won't be unhappy push pull / purity ring There was no light and I swear I could see your raring fear I heard the plains moaning back I saw the thunder roll o'er black There was no light and I swear We sat still in our fear You push and you pull and you tell yourself no It's like when you lie down, the veins grow in slow You push and you pull but you'd never know I crept up in you and I wouldn't let go u don’t know / alison wonderland Give it to me; I can hold my own I know what it’s like to be alone No need to keep me in the dark Already been, I felt that spark You don’t know how it is For someone else to own you Someone else to throw your heart around biting down / lorde It feels better biting down It feels better biting down Skip a hit, don't make a sound (It feels better biting down) Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown (It feels better biting down) The electronics of your heart See how fast they fall apart (It feels better biting down.) flight / son lux Let's be anyone but us, tonight Trade this heavy cage of bones, for flight And when the sirens reach out for us We'll be far away Oh what a noise we'll make Drowning out our mistakes, we can't erase This is the chance we take We shout until our bones break, we can't replace you know I have to go / röyksopp I've learnt how to stay gracious in defeat Cause I've never been victorious And now you offer me to feel complete You've given me your trust Cause I wanna give the honesty you need Nothing false or dubious I want us to be all that we can be I want this for the two of us You know I've got to go There's nothing more to say Surely you will know In the light of day Notes: I'm trash at editing so please excuse the cover
