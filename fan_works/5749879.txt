My Dark Lord Bianca_Wayne Chapter 2 Chapter 2: Becoming his apprentice I was looking for you. I was wondering if I could become your apprentice. I have wanted to join the dark side for a while. So who better to learn from than the grandson of the legendary Darth vader. Kylo was impressed and flattered. He's never been praised before. I'll train you into becoming a sith lord if you do me a favor. Bree looked at him puzzled. What could he possibly mean by that? He continued by saying I want you to become my baby girl. Bree was shocked. Your baby girl? Yes. You will do whatever I say and call me daddy. In return I will protect you with my life and always be by your side. Bree didn't know he was going to be kinky like that. It slightly turned her on. Kylo smirked as he was reading her mind. He always uses the force to read the thoughts of others. So I take it you agree to my terms. Bree nodded her head and blushed. Were you in my head? No, you were throwing your thoughts at me. She blushed even harder then. Aww don't be shy baby girl. There's no need to be shy around daddy.
