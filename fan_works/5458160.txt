He didn't know how he found himself lying under another man, forehead against forehead, his tongue caught in a fight for dominance. Yet his fingers tangled in chestnut locks, cologne and X-wing fuel filling his lungs, an inebriating musk distinctly Poe, a musk woven within the fabric of the leather jacket the pilot gave him. Finn broke the kiss first, both in lack of oxygen and a break from the intoxicating high, the dangerous levels of adrenaline in veins, jumbling his mind and coating his mocha skin in sweat, every touch and kiss new and exciting yet a little to much, a little to foreign for the First Order traitor. Mouth hanging, he maneuvering his head just a tad, avoiding another dizzying, bruising kiss by a mere inch, earning an annoyed husky whine from the man knelt between his legs, a noise that toyed the hardening bulge in his jeans and tinted his cheeks.
