Hux startles awake at the sudden revelation that pierces the fog between waking and sleeping. Next to him, Ren flails in response to being elbowed as Hux scrambles up against the headboard. "What is it?" He slurs, flicking the switch for his reading light. "What happened?" Hux is pale, hazel eyes wide. Couple that with the wild, sleep mussed red hair of his, it would have served to make a peculiar and comical sight. Had it not been for the fact that Hux has his lips parted around unspoken syllables. "Hux? You're scaring me." Ren frowns, reaching over to hold him by his delicate wrists. Hux's lips work for a moment or two, before his owlish eyes blink once. "You love me." Ren snorts. "Of course I do. I am marrying you and your crazy, didn't I?" Hux shakes his head, clambering over to cup Ren's cheeks between his hands. "No, no, no. That's- I mean, you love me. As in, you love me enough to burn the world and lay the ashes at my feet if that is what I asked of you." There is a pause. A beat of silence before Ren moves his hand to check Hux's temperature at his brow. Once satisfied that this was not a sudden bout of fever, Ren smiles. "If that is what you wish. I would ask about what brought this on, but honestly, my alarm is in three hours and I want to sleep with my fianc√© in my arms." Hux allows himself to be folded into an embrace. The room goes dark when the lights are off, illuminated only by the streetlamps. Slowly, he inches his hands to tangle at Ren's dark tresses. "I would burn the world for you too. If that is what you asked of me." Ren sighs, nuzzling close. "Good to know. Now go to sleep."
