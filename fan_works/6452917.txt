"Let me guess, it didn't work out with her." Poe says, smirking at me with that stupid grin. I snort. "Yeah? What makes you say that?" I take a swig of my strong drink. "Well, you keep glaring at people and you're drinking in the morning." "Good job, Poe. You guessed correctly." I run my fingers through my hair. "I just don't know anymore. Maybe I'll just be a one night kinda girl." "Don't say that! You'll find someone, just keep your eyes open, she'll come." Poe assures me. God, he's the best. I nod my thanks and Poe gets up and leaves. I let my head fall onto the table and let out a groan. I give myself a quick head massage and get up. I throw my trash from breakfast away, and look for Poe. "Poe, hey!" I yell. He turns around, and I see someone I hadn't before. She had long brown hair, in cute buns on her head. Brown eyes, beautiful brown eyes. I couldn't stop looking at h- "Hey, Y/N. You here?" I shake my head and look to Poe who was suddenly right by my side. "What? Yeah I'm f-fine. Whoooooo-who's that?" I nod my head towards the woman. He follows my gaze, "That's Rey. She's new." I smile. Rey. It suited her. I look at her. My heart was beating out my chest, my hands were sweaty, I was shaking? What the hell? Why? "You're silent, that never happens. Go and talk to her." Poe nudges my shoulder. I shake my head. "N-no? No. I'm fine right here." "Fine." Poe stands behind me and pushes me towards her. I should've thanked him. -- (Few months later) I look at Rey, sweating and gasping for air. I wipe my mouth, wet from spending time in between her legs. I run my fingers through her hair. "You okay? Sorry if I was rough, I just-" "No, I'm fine. That was amazing, I've never had... that before. Thank you." She smiles at me, and places her hand on my cheek. I turn and kiss her palm. I lay behind her and hold her close, feeling her body against mine. "I love you Rey. I love you so much, I can't even say."
