The first time that Leia gave in and allowed herself to sink into Rey’s embrace had been shortly after Han had died, she had been alone and... longing... for someone to care for her. She had not had the strength to refuse herself happiness and yet... as she lay with Rey’s long limbs wrapped around her, she had felt guilty. Had she used Rey? She would have to ask the next day. Broaching the subject, however... had not been easy. “Rey?” “Leia?” “Did I... did... did you... want this?” Leia’s voice was soft, a little unsure. She had not expected Rey to smile softly at her, to kiss her and smile again. “Yes... Leia.... Yes, I wanted this... I wanted you...” Rey had smiled softly, kissing Leia one last time, pulling her deeper into the embrace. “Now please... rest...” Leia had given in, allowing herself, for once, to relax and be content.
