Finn sits alone for a long time, his mind flashes back to his days training as storm trooper of the First Order. He attempts to recall his family, and finds that they’re all blur a distant memory from somewhere long ago. His eyes well up with tears; he cannot recall a single detail about his family. It’s been so long that he’s forgotten what they even look like. Those years of conditioning beat the memory of them out of him. That was his first lesson, to forget his old life. His life belonged to The First Order. He tried to recall again, this time with greater focus. He took in a breath and let it out slowly. After several minutes of silent recollection, he found that he could hear a faint sound. Slowly but surely it grew louder until the noise became a ringing in his ear. He collapsed panting, flat on his back; it was then when Poe came in. Finn gave him his best smile, but he was unable to hide the fact that he had been crying. “You alright buddy?” Poe walked over to him and sat beside him. “I will be.” Poe draped an arm over him, and smiled at him. “Let’s get something to eat, come on.” Getting up Finn followed Poe out of his room out into the hallway. He gave a glance back his room, before taking Poe’s hand towards the cafeteria.
