Finn’s sitting on one of the hills the base is built into, watching his…father, and his aunt argue in the distance, where they think no one can see them, when Poe finds him. ( So many things make sense now, like the tug in his chest when he first met the General, the way the lightsabre fitted into his hand even as his fingers slipped and slid. The way the screams on Jakku echoed, rang inside his helmet. But now he has so many more questions .) Poe drops down beside him, smiling just as bright as before the Falcon landed. “Should’ve known, really.” When Finn looks at him, he lifts both eyebrows. “This is a rescue? Seems like you’re just carrying on the family tradition, buddy.” Finn thinks about it. About the buzz in his ears and the blood staining Poe’s mouth, the relief bursting like fizz in his chest when Poe finally got it, and the family history everyone’s only been too happy to fill him in on. “I guess so,” he says. Poe grins, slings an arm over his shoulders – careful, always so careful – and presses a kiss to his temple, before they settle down to watch the General throw things at her brother.
