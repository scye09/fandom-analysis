It is believed that loyalty will be a man, but the object of his loyalty is never who others feel it should be. He is loyal to everyone. It has long been known that kindness will be a girl, but the truth isn't quite what some think. She is kind because she has only ever known the alternative. It has always been said that bravery will be a boy, but he won't come from where he should. This does not lessen his courage. It is inevitable that strength will be a woman, but strength comes from having something to protect. Notes: Kudos/concrit much appreciated
