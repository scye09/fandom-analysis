His skin is soft, the kind of soft that makes you feel at peace when stroking it and instantly missing it when you've stopped. You've never felt anything this soft before. Brushing your hands up his sides is almost compulsive. Soft soft soft. How could something so soft and warm exist in this cold, hard world? But he exists. Despite all odds. And so do you. Despite even higher odds. And he laughs and tells you that it tickles. Soft is interrupted by scars. He holds your face in his hands. Strong, soft gentle hands. It's okay to cry now. Notes: Also I don't typically write second person. That's how I wrote the first line which inspired this. I was debating wether or not to make this ambiguously gay but as you can see I made its out Storm Pilot.....so uh bye bye.
