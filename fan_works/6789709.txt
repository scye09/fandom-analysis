You fight in the snow. It seems like you've always been under these dark trees. On this scene. It's been an eternity of light flashing, of wills clashing: you and she. It's a match, struck on a stage, alight with your rage. It's flame on the snow, where the water flows down below, and the blood grows under you. Strike yourself to keep the pain, another blow to find some gain on yourself. Because she's gaining on you, she's finding a high ground, and she's finally coming into herself and her power, now. You keep pushing on, you keep moving forward, you slip and you spin, but never turn backward You're red in the glow, you're dark on the snow, you're fire and you're force. And she's light and she flows, a blue that never spills outwards; she doesn't lose herself as she goes. She always moves back, but fights on relentless, and it's on the edge that she finally glows. She's more than you now, she's more than you know, and all you can do is watch when she goes. She leaves you a mark, it shows what you've lost. She leaves you alive, but what was the cost? A fissure divides you, a line cut in frost And you watch as she goes. Notes: Thanks for reading!
