Leia stirred in her seat. She didn’t know what time it was. Hell, she didn’t even know for certain what day it was. She’d sat down at the desk in her quarters an hour ago, or yesterday, or the day before, she didn’t know and, frankly, it didn’t matter. If someone needed her, they’d come for her, regardless of the time or day. That was what being a General meant. But still, she was curious as to how long she’d been there. Glancing at the chrono on her desk was no help. She hadn’t the foggiest idea what time it had been when she’d come in. But there at her desk, somehow, through her grief and her sorrow and her indefatigable heartache, her body had claimed her for sleep. It had been dreamless, exhausted sleep- that she was grateful for, although she’d done her aging body no favors by allowing her first slumber in days to be in a hard plasitsteel desk chair. Artoo bloooped beside her. The little droid who’d been everywhere that she had, who’d seen everything that she had seen, who’d been the one iota of solace she’d had since The Force had told her in no uncertain terms of the passing of her husband, was wriggling on his struts beside her. It was likely Artoo who had woken her. And if there was one thing that she had learned over these many years with the aged astromech, it was that he deserved her attention when he requested it. “What is it, Artoo?” her hoarse voice asked him. Days of private sobs and public rallly had left her nearly unable to speak, but the droid had understood her address well enough. He spun his dome around halfway and then back, and then flickered his multicolored lights in a clear pattern indicating where he meant for the General to look. As Artoo’s lights chased downward, Leia’s eyes followed them to a little drawer in his cylinder as it slid open. Inside the drawer was a small gray box, with a bent hinge on one end and a sheen of patina that spoke to just how long it had been there. It took a moment for the General to realize what she was looking at. She reached out with trembling hands to take hold of it and remembered. How could she have forgotten? --**--**--**--**--**--**--**--**-- “Hey Luke,” Han called out to his buddy as he spotted the diminutive figure of Princess Leia crossing toward where The Millennium Falcon was being unloaded, “why don’t you go get the package?” Luke looked back at the smuggler with confusion, but when Han inclined his head in the direction of the approaching Princess, it occurred to the young Jedi what package he’d been referring to. Luke grinned excitedly at his friend and dashed up the Falcon’s extended boarding ramp in search of the parcel in question. Han shot Leia a friendly smile as she drew closer. “How was it?” she asked him seriously, taking note as she did of the cases of ammunition that were being offloaded from the Corellian’s freighter by Alliance personnel. “Boring,” Solo answered plainly. “Whatever this ‘vague intelligence’ you’d gotten,” he added, “it wasn’t about Maltauss Station.” Leia quirked an eyebrow at him. Her hands on her hips and a tightness in her jaw told Han that she was about to give him an earful for presuming. “But don’t worry,” he said, hoping to ward off her temper before it fully flared, “we did everything the way you told us to. Chewie stayed with the Falcon,” he reported, “and he says that nobody came within half a click. We took the meeting out in the open with nobody around, just like you said we should. And we took our own repulsor cart, picked up the cargo, brought it back to the ship, and loaded it all ourselves. We just looked like every other independent merchant crew picking up wares at the Station. Nobody even gave us a second look.” Leia appeared to relax at those words. Maltauss Station was one of probably thousands of warehouse installations that could be found throughout the galaxy. Manufacturers and wholesalers regularly met there to make deals for large quantities of cheap goods. It had seemed like the perfect place to hide a delivery of large caliber ammunition in plain sight. And The Millennium Falcon was sure to have no problem fitting in with the hodgepodge of other merchant ships that frequented such places. And Han Solo had easily agreed to make the run, provided the Alliance could meet his price. Seeing as they were in desperate need of this resupply, they’d agreed to his terms immediately. But as he and Chewbacca were preparing their ship for departure, some cryptically worded message traffic had come through the intelligence apparatus and had made command nervous for the success of the mission. It wasn’t clearly referencing the mission to Maltauss, but it could have been. And this supply run was too critical to risk, so extra precaution had been ordered. Han had even talked Luke’s squad leader into letting the young Jedi come along. The Rogues weren’t scheduled for any action that conflicted, and having a second man along that Han trusted just made sense. “Good,” Leia said back to Han, seeming pleased at both the relative ease of the ammo run and the fact that he’d done as she'd asked for once. The ammunition had been critical. They would begin shifting operations to the new base on Hoth any day now, and the need to fully arm both their flotilla and a planetside base had more than one of the Alliance leaders nervous for their supply levels. These crates that Han and Luke had just picked up meant that neither the frigates nor the base would find themselves short on defenses. “Hi,” Luke greeted Leia as he joined the two of them chatting beneath the Falcon’s forward mandibles. “You didn’t tell her, did you?” he asked Han, gesturing to the lacquered box in his hands. Solo shook his head. “Was just about to get to it,” he answered. “Get to what?” Leia quizzed. The look on Solo’s face told her that he was up to something, and the look on Skywalker’s said that he was in on it. She had a bad feeling about this. “Well,” Han said back to her playfully, “we had built some extra time in to our schedule in case we met with any trouble,” he explained, “but we didn’t, so we wound up with a little time on our hands; decided to walk around a little- try to fit in with the locals.” Places like Maltauss Station didn’t really have any ‘locals’. No one lived there save the warehouse droids. But it wasn’t unusual for merchants to pop up stalls in the little spaceport and try to transact a little commerce while their holds were being filled. Leia was sure that's what Solo had meant. “And Luke,” Han continued, turning to look back at his friend. “Well,” he allowed, “tell her.” Skywalker smiled back at Solo and then at the princess. “So we were walking through the merchant stalls,” he related, “and Han had stopped to look at some hand-forged pocket knives that this Devaronian guy was selling. So I was wandering a little and looking around, and I saw this one guy had a holo of you in his display. Naturally I was curious, and so I went over to look and….” He shrugged his shoulders and presented her with the package in his hands. It was a rectangular box, hinged on one end, with rounded corners, a shiny blue lacquer finish, and a hand-tooled copper clasp keeping it shut. Leia took the package and examined it, giving Luke and then Han a quizzical glance in reply. “Open it,” Solo encouraged her. Leia looked back at him expectantly and moved to open the clasp. As she began to lift the lid, Skywalker continued. “The old man there said that the holo was from a couple of years ago. He said this,” Luke referenced the contents of the box, which Leia was just now glimpsing for herself as he went on, “was his wife’s favorite. It belonged to your mother, I guess. He was a little emotional,” Luke admitted. Leia was beginning to get emotional herself. Inside the box was a necklace that she recognized immediately. It had been called the Wreath of the Elements, and it had been part of Breha Organa’s collection from Alderaan’s Crown Jewels. The necklace had large golden and silver discs strung in a circle, each with a gem set into it symbolizing the natural and spiritual elements sacred to the Alderaani. The last that Leia had known of the necklace it had been safely in her mother’s vault on Alderaan when the planet was destroyed. Had there been some sort of touring exhibition that she’d somehow missed knowing about? Were there other pieces of her mother’s jewelry in the hands of anonymous merchants, traveling the galaxy in the back of tramp freighters? “He did say he’d never made a reproduction before,” Luke continued. Okay. So it was a reproduction. That made more sense. But still, it was exquisite. The necklace was just as Leia remembered it and she could feel tears welling their way to the surface as she ran her fingers over the texture of the metal discs. “But his wife, I guess, was on Alderaan. So he thought he’d try….” Luke’s voice trailed off. He could see that Leia was getting emotional over the gift, and he couldn’t figure out what to say next. “He didn’t really want to sell it to us,” Han chimed in. “He said he just liked to have it on display. People would come to look at it, and then they’d buy something else, or commission a piece kind of like it but with other stones or in different metals. But when we told him that we had a friend from Alderaan who’d really love it, he made us a deal.” Leia’s eyes were wide and glistening as she shook her head and looked up at her two friends. “I don’t know what to say,” she said. “It’s beautiful.” Leia closed and clasped the box, hugging it tightly to her chest as she continued. “It was from The Crown Jewels,” she told them. “When a queen ascends the throne, she gets to choose her own collection from them to wear throughout her reign. That holo,” she directed at Luke, “was taken at my mother’s Silver Jubilee,” she told him. “Twenty-five years on the throne. I’d come back from Coruscant, in the middle of my first term as a full senator, and she offered me the choice from her own vault. I chose this one,” she recalled, a tiny hitch coming into her voice, “because I hadn’t seen the gown yet. It had so many colors,” she described, absently stroking her collarbone where the necklace would rest. “There was no chance it wouldn’t go.” Leia looked back at the box and then at the two smiling men before her. “Thank you both so much,” she said. “I can’t tell you how much this means to me.” Han and Luke exchanged a smile as the group of them heard the deck officer call out from across the hangar bay. “Commander Skywalker!” he shouted. “General Madine is looking for you.” Luke was clearly surprised by this revelation, and turned back to his friends with a frown. “Go!” Leia insisted, moving to kiss his cheek even as she shooed him away. “Right,” Luke answered, “see you around,” he added, turning on his heel and scampering across the hangar bay in the direction of the man who’d called his name. “I should really get back,” Leia said to Han. “I’m glad the mission was no trouble,” she added. “And I really appreciate this,” she added, gesturing to the box that she was still holding tightly to her chest. She smiled warmly at him and then turned to go. “Leia, wait,” Han called after her, reaching out and taking her hand before she’d managed even two steps. “What is it?” she asked. Han frowned at her and let go of her hand. Stuffing his hands in to his trouser pockets, he shook his head. Leia recognized his expression as the one he always wore right before he said something serious that he was afraid wouldn’t come out right. “Look,” he began, “that necklace…” his voice trailed off as he searched for the right words. “It’s a big fancy thing and it’s like one you used to have and we couldn’t not get it for you,” he explained. “But I know these days you don’t have a lot of use for big fancy things and it could be a long time until you get to wear it- if you ever get to wear it. So,” he pulled his hands from his pockets then, and in one of them he held a small gray box, hinged on the end just like the larger one, but much simpler and lacking the ornate clasp. “So when I went to pick it up from the jeweler, I also got you this.” He presented the little box to her then. “I just thought,” Han continued as he watched Leia open the tiny box, “that you might get more wear out of these.” Leia nodded her head as she examined the contents of the tiny box. The earrings were gold in color. Small, tight circles with triangular texture on one side, they were as close to practical as Leia figured jewelry could really get. She really might get some wear out of them. “The old guy said that the metal was mined on Alderaan,” Han shared. “I don’t know if that’s the truth, or if he was just saying that to justify the price he was asking. But that’s what he said. And I thought that it was kind of not fair for us to get you something really nice but that you wouldn’t ever get to use. So I figured you could wear those and think about the other thing.” He shrugged, waiting for the princess to respond. She smiled, shut the box, and stepped forward to kiss his cheek much as she had done Luke’s. “That was really thoughtful,” she told him. He wrapped an arm around her shoulder and squeezed. “You deserve to have a few nice things,” he told her sincerely, the words coming easier now that he was sure that he wouldn’t have to look at her while he said them. And even though they were in the middle of a bustling hangar full of personnel, and even though she was sure that he gossip about this would take weeks to dissipate, she couldn’t help but to hug him back. --**--**--**--**--**--**--**--**-- The necklace had been lost when they’d bugged out of Hoth, along with nearly everything else that Leia had managed to hold on to since Alderaan. But the earrings…. She’d given the earrings to Artoo for safe keeping when Luke had flown as her escort to a summit on Minos Ten, where she’d worn them to a formal function- and been complimented on them if she recalled the evening correctly. That had turned out to be her last mission away before the evacuation. How could she have forgotten to get them back? Of course she knew the answer to that. Things had been so busy, so hectic in those days. Trying to get personnel and equipment relocated and adapted to life on the ice had left her very little bandwidth for things like keeping track of a pair of golden earrings, even a pair that was so dear to her as these. And Artoo had held onto them for all this time. How many years had it been? Thirty? More? As she opened the little box, careful of its busted hinge, her heart was full. Just days ago she’d lost her home for the second time. And although it was a rare thing for her to visit the small apartment these days, it was the place that had amassed the memories of her life since the last war- since the last time she’d lost everything. It was the place that housed the trinkets and treasures that made up a life. It was the place where she and Han had spent so many happy years. And only hours after that great loss came a loss even greater. Oh, how her heart ached when she thought of Han: of all of the things she’d waited to say and now would never get to. How cruel the universe that her husband would be taken from her in such a way. But how precious that this golden piece of him was being returned to her now. How perfect that the little droid who’d brought them together in the first place, who’d seen them through times of joy and of sorrow, would come to her now and return such a powerful memory. They’d been one of the most thoughtful gifts that Han had ever given her- and they’d been the first. She fingered the delicate metal circles where they lay, still clasped into their sloughing velvet keepers and thought back to when she’d first received them. Han would be pleased to learn that he hadn’t been taken by the jeweler. The matte shine they retained, lacking any other patina or visible signs of age, told her that they were indeed fashioned of Alderaani gilt ore. It was a metal unique to her home world, slightly less valuable than gold, but popular with jewelers for its malleability and ease of care. No other metal in the galaxy aged like this one did. It was a profound thing, Leia considered, that here in this moment she was holding the last piece she had of her home world, and the last memento she had of the man whose arms had meant home to her for the greater part of her life. Just as Alderaan had remained the home of her heart even as she’d lived more years away from it than she had lived there, so had Han been the heart of her life even when life had sent them reeling in opposite directions. And here in her hand was the one thing she’d ever possessed that could tie her to both of them. She placed her hand on the little droid’s dome. “Thank you, Artoo,” she said. “This was just what I needed.” He tweetered a response and Leia nodded. “You can stay with me for a while,” she answered him softly as she set the still-open jewelry box on her desk. Sitting there in the company of a droid who remembered her life as well as she did, and staring down at a gift that she hadn’t known at the time was the beginning of a million wonderful things, she found a moment of solace. And the thought that it was only a space of days before Chewie and Rey took off to find her missing brother gave her a tiny bit more. She knew that she’d want to wear the earrings when she saw Luke again. Luke: who might recognize the sentimental pieces, but had never been told of their exact origin. Luke: who hadn’t known at the time that she was his sister, or that she and Han were already falling in love. Luke: who she hoped might have the answers she lacked as to what was to come next. There were no answers in the lacquer and velvet box sitting before her. But there were memories. Good memories. And for the moment, that would have to be enough. Notes: What started out as a buddy comedy about Han and Luke and buying some jewelry turned into something totally different. But I like to let the muse do her work, and I'm pretty satisfied. I'd love to know what you think.
