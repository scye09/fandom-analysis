Kylo has been knocked out for several hours now. Hux, who actually slept last night instead of endlessly cramming, is keeping watch by his side. Watch for what, he doesn’t know, but Kylo asked him to stay, and he’s staying. Hux drops his hands into his lap and looks down at Kylo on the bed. He’s breathing deeply, hands cupped together in front of his face. Hux smooths a strand of hair away from Kylo’s face and bends down to kiss his forehead. Kylo moans softly and shifts against Hux’s lips. Hux draws back immediately and puts his hand on Kylo’s back instead, almost smiling when Kylo curls into his touch and makes another quiet noise. He scratches Kylo’s back for good measure, and then- after listening closely to make sure that the house is still empty- he takes off his shoes and lies down behind Kylo himself. He lies there, arms wrapped around Kylo’s warm chest, until Kylo wakes up in a sort of daze. “I told you to stay here,” he mumbles in confusion, moving his hand to the spot where Hux was sitting before. “You didn’t tell me not to lie down,” Hux retorts quietly, kissing his hair. “And you were quite persuasive in wanting me to hold you.” Kylo sighs happily and turns around, tangling his fingers into the soft fabric of Hux’s shirt. “Just stay here,” he murmurs. “Please.” Notes: if you liked this, please tell me what exactly you liked!! any comment telling me "___ was my favorite part" or "the way you ___ was good" is automatically inspiration for a new fic. please don't comment/interact if you ship r*ylo; it triggers me.
