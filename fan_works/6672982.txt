Rey opened her eyes as she felt light spread across her still form. The sun shone brightly in the room. “Good morning,” she heard, turning to the voice. “Good morning to you, too,” Rey replied with a small smile, stretching. She reached out to touch his face, feeling the stubble there. “I quite like you like this.” “Just like this?” Kylo asked her, smirking back. “Well, more ways than one, really.” They both chuckled lightly and he pulled her to him. “For how long?” he questioned her. “A while,” she admitted softly, kissing him quickly. “A while.” He doesn’t have to barge his way into her mind with the bond, and sees when she first felt feelings for him. He knows he’s liked her longer, but who could blame him? “Could you like me for a while longer?” His question is sincere, and she knows this. I think I could like you for quite some time, she whispers to him through the bond.
