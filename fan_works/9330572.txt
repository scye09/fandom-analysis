The Tales They Spun It amused Kylo Ren, to hear the stories they whispered. Romantics on both sides spun tales of the night he had brought an end to the new Jedi. Some claimed a spurned love drove him to murder, others, that he and another had pursued the heart of a woman, and that jealousy had led to his actions. They spoke of star crossed lovers, of envy, of passion. They were strangely popular, these tales of love, and every side and inner faction had a story that they preferred. The most pervasive tale, however, was that he had spared a single Padawan. The Padawan was always female in their stories, always some gentle human whose kind ways had swayed him to spare her. The romantics whispered of tearful kisses, of heart wrenching goodbyes, of love that stayed unbroken. They claimed she wondered the galaxy still, the sole survivor, searching unceasingly for a way to return her lost lover to the Light. It made him want to laugh, and wonder at the universe, for they were both right and wrong. He had spared a Padawan on that fateful night- not out of love, but respect.
