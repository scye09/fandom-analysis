She did it to her own son, Leia knows. Not Han, his father. Not Luke, his teacher. Herself. She's heard the rules explained many times. Anger leads to the Dark Side. Hate leads to the Dark Side. The rules never stopped her from despising the thing in the mask. Luke could forgive the thing she won't call father. Luke didn't have to remember being in that monster's grip as her entire world exploded. Luke never knew any other parents. It's why she never attempted Jedi training. Leia hates Vader. Part of her even hates the Force. Ben always felt it.
