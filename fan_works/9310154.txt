It takes enormous strength and trust for Finn to tell Rey his dreams. “They take me back,” he whispers. “They always take me back.” No one has ever claimed Rey like that. Rey was a nothing girl. She meant nothing to anyone. She takes Finn in her arms awkwardly. Neither of them are used to the concept of touch as comfort, but they’ve been learning since they found each other. “I won’t let them,” she says with the ferocity of sand storm. “I’ll kill anyone who tries.” She rests her head against Finn’s shoulder. “You belong where you want to belong.” “I belong here,” Finn says. He’s silent for several moments, and Rey has the sense to wait. “I belong with you.” With Finn, Rey is not nothing. She matters to Finn, to Poe, to Master Skywalker, to General Organa. With them, she’s something. “Stay with me.” “Always,” promises Finn.
