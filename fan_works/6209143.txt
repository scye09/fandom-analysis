Ben had crappy handwriting and it never bothered him. Until college when he had to write his name on a sticker and wear it for the benefit of getting to know people. “Ren?” a ginger asked, thrusting a hand at Ben in greeting. “Weird name. I’m Hux.” “It’s Ben,” Ben corrected in a small voice. Hux didn’t seem to hear him. The ginger just proceeded to drag Ben around, introducing him as ‘Ren’. The nickname stuck. It wasn’t until the welcoming party Senior Year that someone called him by his real name, even though he wrote ‘Ren’. “Ben? I’m Rey.” Notes: As a medical student, I know the importance of having legible handwriting. BUT as a medical student, I don't have the luxury of writing legibly.
