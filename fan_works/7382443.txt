“Your Highness?” Mitaka waited for the blind man to turn in his direction before stepping a little closer, clearing his throat before speaking again, “I was recently sent by your brother to check on some trade agreements near the coast. I found this polished stone and I thought that you would like it,” he said, producing a white rock from his robes. He pressed the rock into the palm of one of Techie's hands, watching and waiting to see his reaction. “Oh!” Techie smiled as he rubbed the stone between the palms of his hands, enjoying the sensation of the smooth rock between his flesh. “This is such a lovely stone! I will be sure to keep it with my other calming treasures! You are always so kind to me, Mitaka.” Mitaka blushed, shifting on his feet as he watched Techie slip the stone into a small pouch at his hip. “I am only too glad to make you happy, my prince. I...” He fell silent when he saw the potter arrive and he cleared his throat and stood up a little straighter, offering the blonde a small nod of his head and a friendly smile. “Master Potter...” “Oh! Matt!” Techie perked up and smiled brightly as he reached out for the former slave, touching his arm. “Mitaka has brought me a stone from the coast!” Matt looked over at Mitaka and nodded a little. “Another addition to your treasure?” he asked. Techie giggled brightly, nodding his head. “I fear you may have to craft me another box to keep all of my treasures safe, my love!” he said. Politely Mitaka bowed his head, taking his leave of the two before his face could turn any redder. Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 16 of the Rome series Next Work →
