“You want to name him what?” Leia Organa was convinced that she had heard him wrong. There was absolutely no way that Han Solo would ever propose naming their unborn son after Ben Kenobi, of all people. Han shrugged. “It was just an idea, your Worshipfulness.” “Yes, but, you didn’t even like him!” she pressed. He didn’t deny it. “You liked him.” “I never met him,” she countered. “I respected him for his actions in the Clone Wars. Luke was the one who liked him personally. You and I have no real connection to him.” “Well, princess, that’s not exactly true. See, if you hadn’t sent the droids to him, and if he hadn’t hired me to fly him to Alderaan, you and I’d have never met. He was a crazy old wizard, don’t get me wrong, but I feel like I owe him one.” “I… I’ve never thought of that,” she admitted. He grinned. “I never thought I’d hear you admit defeat.” She hit him with a couch cushion. In the end, the newest Solo was christened Ben, as his father suggested. Ironically, if Ben Kenobi had been the one to bring the princess and the smuggler together, Ben Solo would be the one to tear them apart.
