The sand was warm and soft under Rey’s feet as she led Finn down the coastline, letting go of his hand to free a partially buried, iridescent conch shell. “Ooh, look at this seashell! This is a nice one,” she beamed. “It’s lovely. What does it do?” Finn asked. “Nothing, really,” she admitted, rinsing it in the ocean. “Just looks pretty. I like finding things, even if I don’t miss scavenging. I’ll have to show you my collection.” Finn looked out over the shore. “I’d like to collect some, too.” “Of course!” Rey pocketed her shell and took Finn’s hand.
