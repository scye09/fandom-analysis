Grimacing, Hux limps towards the main controls, trying to ignore the thought of the shrapnel in his leg twisting through sinew and meat to grind against bone - what does it matter though, with the Finalizer breaking apart around him? All hope is lost and yet- If I can't have the galaxy, then the afterlife will do . A small explosion nearby almost floors him, but he's at the controls finally, the screen cracked but still functional. With one hand, he grips the terminal to steady himself, ignoring the smeared blood and incessant pulses of pain that parallel the Finalizer's own alarms. The fingers of his other hand skitter and shake over the keys to override the safety features, divert auxiliary power, back-up power any power because there's not much time, not much time - Calm. He will remain calm. He will face his death with the dignity and grace that befits the General of the First Order. He will stare death down, secure in the knowledge that his sacrifice - my life, my crew, my ship - will echo throughout history; secure in the knowledge that this is the end of the Resistance, but not of the First Order. Punching in his personal command codes, he manually enters co-ordinates and primes the hyperdrive. Colliding with the Resistance flagship at lightspeed will create an explosion of such magnitude that the resultant blast wave alone will decimate the rest of the Resistance fleet. "I'll wait for you in death, Ren." Murmuring to himself, he smiles slightly before it's broken by pain, then gone entirely. He lingers a moment more before keying in confirmations and looking up to watch the stars blur one final time. In that moment, Hux thinks of the knight - my knight - safely ensconced in Snoke's citadel to see out his training. See you in hell .
