Is kind of relevant right now ?” Hux cannot handle Kylo when he’s being like this: an over-dramatic child . “It was filthy.” “You don’t just put it in the laundry! That was a relic!” “Well, it’s just added more mystique,” Hux suggests, holding out the ragged (more ragged) shawl. “Being tumble-dried is not mystical.” “Look, there weren’t any instructions on it, and it was basically crawling into the toilet to look for water. I did you a favour. You probably need a Bacta-bath.” “ I am not talking to you for the rest of the night .” “…that’s fine, I can use your mouth for–” A hand slaps over his face, and Hux blinks in surprise.
