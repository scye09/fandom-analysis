Kylo held on to Hux a little tighter as the monster on the screen jumped out - attacking the unsuspecting female lead. Hux snorted, “Kylo, please! This isn’t even scary!” Kylo held on to Hux a little tighter and even shrieked as the werewolf-monster thing ate the girl’s head. Hux rolled his eyes and patted his boyfriend’s shoulder. “At least I have you to protect me,” Kylo teased. Hux flicked him on the nose and turned back to the movie. The werewolf on screen turned away from the dead girl and walked further into the forest, looking for its next victim. The music got louder and more dramatic, as the shot went back to the group of three men trying to find their way away from the monster, and into safety. While two of the men continued bickering about which way to go, and whether or not the hot female lead was dead, the other one heard a growl. Kylo gripped tighter onto Hux’s arm as the music got even louder. “Uhhhh… guys.” The third guy on the screen said right before the monster clawed at his throat. The front door of their house swung open at the same time revealing a tall figure with dark hair all over his body. The figure groaned loudly and Hux felt his skin jump off of him, his heart stop. “JESUS FUCK!” Hux screamed. Kylo jumped back at first then studied the figure for a little bit. A man entered right behind the figure and tsk-ed. “Aww, guys that’s no way to greet Uncle Chewie!” Kylo got up and rubbed his neck sheepishly. “Hey dad.” He walked over to the pair of men and gave both of them a hug. He turned back to Hux and smiled. “Hux you’ve met my father, but you remember Uncle Chewie right? He has Ambras syndrome.” Kylo said with an emphasis on ambras syndrome. Hux nodded slowly trying to regain his breath. It wasn’t like he thought that Kylo’s uncle was a werewolf or anything… how ridiculous would that be? Notes: Hoped you liked it!
