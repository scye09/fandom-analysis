"How do you know her?!" Kylo screams. He saw her. He saw Y/N. In some stranger's mind. He left her many years ago, but she never ever went away from him. "I could ask you the same thing." Poe asks, gasping for air. "You know Y/N." Kylo turns from him. Feelings of anger flooded his mind and heart at the thought of someone else with Y/N. Someone else making her laugh. Someone else looking deep into her beautiful E/C eyes. Someone else holding her. Someone else kissing her. Someone else seeing her skin, bare. Someone else making love to her. Kylo began to shake. His breathing became heavier by the second. He throws off his helmet and run his gloved hands through his long hair. Poe observed the man. "You knew her, didn't you?" Kylo straightened. "Yes. I did. A long time ago. She was my first. I loved her." "You left her." Poe concluded. "Yes. I had no other choice. I think about it everyday and I regret it." And Kylo did, and he will, for the rest of his life. Notes: Star Wars imagine blog: the-imagines-awaken.tumblr.com Personal: theaideneliis.tumblr.com
