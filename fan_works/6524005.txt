The couple, Y/N and Kylo, sat in silence on their bed. Kylo could feel how anxious Y/N was. They were overworking themselves. Again. Kylo turned his head to look at Y/N. They were massaging their temple with a pained look on their face. The Sith bit his lip. He could... He stands in front of Y/N with both of his gloved hands in front. He motions to them. Y/N sighs and holds onto them. They stand up and Kylo pulls them close. He breathes in the scent of their hair. He places his arms on his lover's waist, and Y/N returns the favor by wrapping their arms around his shoulders. Kylo leans his forehead against theirs then one... two... three. He took very small steps. There was no music, they didn't need any. It was just the two of them. Them against the rest of the galaxy. Notes: the-imagines-awaken.tumblr.com theaidenellis.tumblr.com
