#1 Ben had been experiencing morning sickness every day for the past few days, and he began to worry. He didn't know if it was because there was something wrong with him, or that maybe he was pregnant. He took in the fact that him and his boyfriend, Hux had sex, and the next day the morning sickness started. That made him worry, especially since he didn't know what to do if he was pregnant. He was going to keep the baby, that's for sure. But he wasn't sure how Hux was going to react to the news. The thought of Hux leaving him ran through his head like a train. Crashing into his nerves and confidence. So that's when Ben decided to go buy a pregnancy test. Hopefully I'm not pregnant, Ben said to himself before getting up, and running to the bathroom to throw up. Chapter 2 : #2 Chapter by urfave , zistysfosgerald Ben went to the store to get a box of pregnancy tests, and he was extremely nervous. He wondered if Hux would leave him if he got pregnant, and who would help him take care of the baby. Would he be on his own? Or would his parents actually help him? All these questions ran through his head as he drove to get the tests. That's when he got a phone call, and it was his best friend, Rey. "Hey, Ben," she said, and that made him smile. "Hey, Rey. What's up?" Ben asked, and Rey sighed. "Just at the store, getting pads for my roommate. Since she broke both her legs." she said with a shrugged, and Ben's eyes went wide. "Which store are you at?" "Target, why?" Rey asked, and Ben started to panic. "Oh...um...nothing, was just wondering because I'm in the parking lot." "Oh cool! I just got out of the car, we should shop together." Rey suggested, and that didn't help Ben's case. "Totally." he said with remorse.
