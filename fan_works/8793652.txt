Phasma has to admit she was skeptical at his initial offer. Why would anyone willingly touch someone else’s feet? You stood on them all day, and that wasn’t pleasant. But he’d been politely insistent, and so she’d said they could try. Of course he’d think this through. Kylo was actually very inventive and thorough when he put his mind to it. The small basin of warm, fragrant water he puts before her is the perfect start to it. She bites back a moan at the feel of soaking, the tide-mark of heat around her ankles sending the throb up and through her legs. His fingers rub firmly enough not to tickle, easing off the sweat and grime of the day, getting her blood pumping properly. Once he’s washed them both, he urges them out and pats the worst of the water off with a fluffy towel placed across his knees. The towel goes flat, and then he picks up the lotion. “…won’t… I be too slippery?” “Not if I work it in,” Kylo insists. He warms it first. How is he this thoughtful? Why is she failing so abysmally to keep up with his efforts? Phasma feels her face and chest get hot as his long digits massage around the bones of one ankle, then stroke over the top to her toes. He works each one individually, and then his thumbs push her sole up and he prods and presses at places that have weird jolts run through her. “…h-how?” “The Force,” he claims. She’s not sure if it’s true or not, but the firm touches have her almost slipping out of the chair in a liquid flop. He puts down her first foot, and she’s about to pout when his hands go to the left. Yep. This was a good plan. She strokes her silky-smooth one against his wrist, beaming down at him. He’s going to get what’s coming to him for this. Oh yes.
