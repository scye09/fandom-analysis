Phasma smiled as his stubble grazed her cheek - as sure a sign as any that he’d been planetside longer than anticipated. She cared not for whatever mystic artefacts Leader Snoke had hoped to recover from Mortis. Soldiers would win this war, not ancient Jedi trinkets. But orders were orders. She weaved her fingers into Ren’s hair, much longer than she remembered and tied back in a single thick braid, and guided him to her lips. He tasted the same as always - plush lips laced with salt and steel, and a faint but lingering sweetness. More than once, she had wondered if this was the taste of the Force, or just another of Ren’s own peculiarities. He laughed softly as they bumped noses, the two of them relearning the motions that had become so practiced before their time apart. “I’ll shave,” he promised, running his fingers over his jawline. Phasma took his hand in hers and leaned forward, nipping the fingertip of his glove with her teeth and giving a short, sharp tug. “It doesn’t conform to regulation,” she agreed, tossing the glove aside. “But then, as I understand it, neither does your position within the Order.” “I’m surprised,” he grinned, eyes following the leather glove’s trajectory. It landed on the bed with a soft thud. “You’re usually so strict , Captain .” “Well, perhaps I am a little biased.” Her own hand brushed over his stubble, just rough enough to scratch. She followed his gaze to the bed. “In any case…we’re not on duty now .” Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 14 of the Far Above the Moon series Next Work →
