"He's nice to me," Techie murmured, looking down at the ground. "But why him of all people?" Techie shrugged and Hux groaned and threw his head back. "Techie..." "Please don't be mean to him?" Hux looked at his little brother, clenching his jaw briefly before forcing himself to relax. "Fine," he said. He sighed as his brother hugged him, returning the gesture before sending him away. He looked back at Matt then, raising an eyebrow. "Well?" "I care about him," Matt mumbled. "If he comes to harm I will kill you." "...sure." Hux smiled, dismissing the radar technician.
