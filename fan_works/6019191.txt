“Riley, are you reading Star Wars fanfiction again?” Maya huffed, making grabby hands at her best friends phone. “Don’t judge me! Poe and Finn are meant for eachother!” The brunette gasped, as if literally wounded at the thought that Maya didn’t see what was so painfully obvious. “Ladies, ladies!” Farkle cried as he slid into Riley’s room through the bay window. “We all know that Han and Luke are the real love story of Star Wars.” Riley squealed in agreement while Maya rolled her eyes, leaning back against the window. “Are we talking about Star Wars?” Zay appeared at the door, a large bowl of pasta in hand. “Because we all know that Han and Leia are THE OTP. Scoundress for life, my homies!” Suddenly Lucas appeared, seemingly from nowhere. “What about Kylo Ren and Rey? Can’t we ship them?” Maya sighed, placing a hand on Lucas’s shoulder, “Ranger, you realize they’re probably related right?” She smirked, “Besides, Rey and Jessika Pava would make a much better couple."
