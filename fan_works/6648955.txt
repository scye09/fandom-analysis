“Go Kylo,” You pushed him out the door. “This meeting is really important to you.” “I’m not going,” Kylo tried to walk back in but you kept blocking him out. “For sith sakes (Name), it looks like you’re about to burst!” You were nine months pregnant with a little girl. Kylo was right, you were about to burst. Your stomach was huge. It had swollen to a size that you or Kylo didn’t think was possible. It look like you were going to pop any second. You rolled your eyes at Kylo. “Honey, I’m fine. I ain’t due for another 3 weeks.” “(Name)...” Kylo was hovering over you. “I can’t leave you alone.” “Kylo, for the twentieth time I’m going to be fine. Didn’t you say this meeting was going to be 10 minutes or something like that?” “Yes,” He said. “Okay, I’ll go. Just stay here. Okay? Don’t go wondering around.” “I won’t.” You kissed him on the tip of his nose. He smiled. “Okay, I’ll be home in an hour.” He kissed your cheek and he was gone. ------------------------------------------------ “Kylo, she’ll be fine.” Hux said as Kylo paced back and forth. “She could be going in labor right now! What if she slipped in the shower and can’t get up? Oh god what if she can’t make it to the kitchen?” Kylo was still pacing around. He was rubbing his hands together. “Ren your wife can make it into the kitchen,” Hux rolled his eyes. “The woman literally walked across the ship to give you your lunch while 8 months pregnant.” Phasma sighed. “Kylo, Do you want me to go check on your wife?” “You’ll miss the meeting.” Kylo turned to her. She shrugged. “That’s fine. Just say I have duties to finish.” “Okay. Thank you Phasma.” Kylo put on his mask and headed into the meeting room. “I have files to report and so do you. After checking on Lady Ren, report your files to me.” Hux commanded and walked away. Phasma signed again. “Can I ever get a break around here.” -------------------------------------------- Meanwhile you were on the couch, ready to devour your waffles and strawberries. “Oh boy, I’m so excited.” You squealed and grabbed the whip cream can and sprayed a little on the strawberries. “Nah,” You sprayed some more. “Okay a little more.” Your whip cream looks like a mountain now. It was all perfect. “Okay one for good luck.” You sprayed whip cream into your mouth. You picked up your fork when you felt pain going up your spine. “Holy-Oh come on! Can we eat first?” You heard your water broke and feeling the contractions.“Okay we’ll do it your way.” You got up from the couch and the pain became unbearable. “Holy shit.” You picked up your data pad and contacted the medical wing. “(Name)? Hey we miss you at work!” Rita said on the other line. “I miss you too. Rita It’s time. The baby’s coming” You were taking deep breaths. “What?” You could hear things falling down and crashing to the floor. “(Name)-” “I’ll be there as soon as possible.” You dismiss the call. You tired to put on your shoes. You groaned and got up. “I guess we’ll do this barefoot.” You opened the door and looked around your quarters. “Let’s go have a baby.” You smiled and closed the door behind you. ----------------------------------------------------------- You saw Phasma on the other end of the hallway. Oh good. I hope she doesn’t freak out. “(Name!) What are you doing?” I was wrong. “You should be at your quarters resting. I was about to check on you!” Phasma looked down at your feet. “Why don’t you have your shoes on?” “Funny thing to ask..” You started to giggle until you felt sharp pain going up your spine again. “Oh Sweet sith!” “(Name)? Oh god don’t tell me-” “Yep,” You gave her a weak smile. “Phasma it’s time.” “Oh god, oh god Kylo’s going to freak,” She helped you up. “Why couldn’t you wait?” “I don’t know,” You started to cry. “Can you please help me get to the med bay! please!” Now you regret leaving the quarters. The both of you were practically running through the base. Tears were strolling down your eyes and your feet hurt like hell. You walked past a group of people looking at a hologram of the new base. “Girls?” Hux turned around. Of course, Hux was noisy. “Where are you both suppose to be?” He choked when he saw that it was you and Phasma. “Hux, Where is Kylo?” You asked. “In the meeting room. He should be done by now.” He was staring at you. You saw the fear in his eyes. A stormtrooper was walking by, ignoring the scene. “HR-7899.” Hux ordered. “Yes, Sir.” The stormtrooper gripped his hands tighter on his blaster. “Find Kylo Ren and tell him his wife is in the Medical Wing...and in labor.” He looked at you then back to the stormtrooper. “Yes Sir!” The Stormtrooper headed to the meeting rooms. “Be quick! Come on (Name), Let’s get you to the medical wing.” ------------------------------------------------------------- Kylo left the meeting room. He was rushing to get back to his quarters and make sure you were okay. “Sir! Sir!” The stormtrooper stopped right in front of Kylo. “What do you want?” His robotic voice anger up. “Your...wife…” The stormtrooper was shaking. “Medical wing…” The stormtrooper didn’t finish his sentence. Kylo practically ran to the medical wing pushing everyone out of his way. ------------------------------------------------------------ “Oh god where is he?” You screamed.You were already pushing. You grip on the side of the beds tighter. “He’s on his way (Name). Now I need you to push.” Rita said. The doors to the room burst opened. It was Kylo. He took off his mask and let it drop to the floor. “Love.” Kylo ran to your side. He grabbed your hand. The room was just filled with your screams. ------------------------------------------------------------------ “She’s so beautiful.” You were holding your baby girl, Luna. Holding your baby is a feeling of total elation that is very difficult for words to describe. “She got your looks.” Kylo smiled at you. He was sitting on the bed next to you. “You wanna hold her?” You asked. “Of course. She is my daughter.” He chuckled. You handed her to kylo. He was amazed by Luna’s perfection. “Hi,” He said. “Hi, Luna. I’m your daddy.” Kylo began to cry. The room was filled with happy emotions. You can’t wait for the years to come.
