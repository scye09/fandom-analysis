** “Go forth my Knight, and find the Dragon Starkiller. You will gain its trust, then slay it and take its remaining dragon core, to power our ultimate weapon, Starkiller Base!” ** “You fool me not, Little Lost Prince. Once upon a time a Sith Lord came to me, gained my trust, and stole one of my cores. It crippled me, and brought nothing but Chaos to the world.” And the Dragon loved Order above all else. ** But the Dragon kept the Little Prince, because it was a Dragon. Besides order, it also loved Princesses. Since there were no Princesses at hand, a Prince would have to do. And so Kylo Ren lived with the Dragon, and got to know it as a man. ** The Force around the Dragon was balanced, the screams quiet. Kylo Ren failed his mission for the first time in his life. Ben Solo never went back to the suffering world. And the Dragon who once killed stars, but had since grown disinterested and weary of life, found that a Prince was just as good as a Princess, and everything colorful again. ** Princess Rey and Princess Leia defeated the evil wizard Snoke, and freed all the men and women he had entralled. And they all lived happily ever after. ** The End Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 2 of the TFA short fills series Next Work →
