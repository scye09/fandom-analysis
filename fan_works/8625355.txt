Hux adjusted the shoulder pads beneath his cape, admiring the vivid crimson of the lining. The galaxy needed to see Armitage Hux the General , Armitage Hux the Emperor , and not some dandy in Arkanisian finery - yet his skepticism over the tailor’s choice of colour had been unwarranted. It provided the perfect accompaniment to his sleek, charcoal parade uniform. He caught a glimpse of Kylo Ren in the mirror, looming at the doorway. He still wore his mask, but Hux could sense the conflict bubbling beneath. A smile tugged at the corners of his lips. “Afraid you won’t find your place here, Lord Ren? I’m sure I can find some use for you.” “Oh, you might be the Emperor now, but I’m not afraid of you.” Ren almost sounded like he was laughing. “I’m afraid for you. I’m sure you recall just how many assassination attempts were made on the previous Emperor.” “Yes, and I recall who killed him.” Ren tightened his grip on the hilt of his lightsaber and grit his teeth, the sound pouring from his mask like static. “A moment of weakness in the face of his past. Need I remind you that I have proven I will not make the same mistake?” Hux turned to face him as he pulled on his gloves. “Any reminder of your devotion to the Empire is more than welcome.” Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 12 of the Far Above the Moon series Next Work →
