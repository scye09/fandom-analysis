BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE Anna watched quietly from the shadows as the peculiar girl stared her mentor down. She was a mere wisp of a thing, with brown hair, and stark eyes. Slowly, the young woman reached into her bag, her eyes never straying from their mark. Anna tensed, and crouched down readying herself to jump into action, as she grit her teeth together. The wind picked up, as the girl withdrew her arm, and held out a cylinder in front of her. No, that can’t be… Anna bit back a gasp as she sensed a tremor rushing past her. Something was stirring in the force. Pulling back his hood, Luke cocked his head to the side, “Who are you?” he yelled over the wind. “I’m no one,” the girl replied as she shifted on her feet. Anna’s master chuckled, and took a step towards the girl, “Yet I assume, you know all too well who I am.” The girl took a step back. Suddenly the lightsaber was pulled from her grasp, flying through the air to settle in Master Skywalker’s hand. The sword ignited with a hum of pure energy, the blue glow intensifying the marks of age upon his face. “This sword once belonged to my father, and myself for a time,” he glanced at the girl who stood her ground, staff in hand. Diffusing the weapon he held it out to her, “I sense it now has a new master.” Tentatively she took the saber. Luke turned back towards the cliff, “What is your name?” he asked stepping out of Anna’s sight. Deftly, she maneuvered around the burial stone, until the two were visible once again. Staring at the sword in her hand, the girl looked up at him stunned. “Uh-um, Rey,” she said shaking the shock from her mind, “My name is Rey.” “A good name,” he replied. Pulling up his hood he starts down the hill, Rey running after him. Anna sticks to the shadows, staying just within earshot. “Wait! Where are you going?” Rey yells. Luke ignores her. The girl growls, her face turning red in frustration. Anna lets a smirk quirk the corners of her mouth. She knows the feeling. She gets too caught up in focusing on the conversation, that she loses her footing, rocks sliding out from under her feet. She jumps to the side with a grunt. Looking around, she spots the duo further down the hill. Rey is still yelling, “You’re Luke Skywalker, Master of the Jedi Order. General Organa sent me.” Luke glances back at her before entering a hut, “I can’t help you,” he says pulling the flap closed behind him. Rey stands speechless, before she grits her teeth and follows him inside. Making her way around the hut she found a patch near the bottom. Lifting it up she looks through it. “What do you mean you can’t help me? We need you, you’re the only one who can stop Kylo Ren and---,”Rey said, as Skywalker sits in front of a small fire. Without looking at her he spoke quietly, “Ren is not the one you should concern yourself with,” he said, “There is a true evil behind the First Order. “Supreme Leader Snoke,” Rey said. Luke nodded and stirred the coals. Rey sat on her knees and implored him, “Come back with me, and help us fight.” “I don’t fight anymore,” he said, embers burning in his eyes. Rey frowned. Lifting her head, she clenched her hands into fists, “Then train me.” Anna let the tent cover fall back into place, and listened knowing well what his answer was going to be, Nice try, but get in line, I’ve the past two years trying to bring him back. Luke’s laugh echoed from within the tent, “I am no teacher. I’ve learned my lesson well.” The air was silent and Anna leaned against the tent, brown hair blowing in the wind. She closed her eyes, a melancholy smile moving across her lips, “You mean Ben Solo,” Rey’s voice whispered. Anna sat up--- Ben? Reaching down she pulled the patch back up and peeked inside, her heart beginning to race. “How do you know that name?” Luke asked, looking at her for the first time since they had entered the hut. Rey looked away. Gritting her teeth she spoke quickly, “He killed Han Solo, and almost killed one of my friends,” she looked back at Luke, “So, train me. Teach me the ways of the Force, so I can help my friends.” Anna closed her eyes feeling the determination and fury emanating from Rey. The Jedi Master looked back into the fire, “You are angry,” he said with a sigh. “Yes,” the girl answered. “Ben was angry too,” Luke murmured, “And thousands have died because I could not see how deep that anger went.” Standing up, he exited the hut, with Rey in tow. Inching her way forward Anna watched, with a grim weight resting on her shoulders. Luke turned around and faced Rey his robes fluttering in the wind, “I will not train you.” ************************** Sitting on a boulder, Luke watched as the girl descended from the hill. “She’ll come back, you know,” a voice murmured behind him. He clenched his jaw, “The young are always stubborn. You will see, Anna,” he said turning around, “One day you’ll wake up and wonder, ‘Was I that much of an ass when I was their age?’” She stared at him, her face impassive, “Train her,” she said. “No.” “Master, this is your chance,” she said kneeling by his side, “Mold her, teach her, show her the ways of the Force before---.” Luke cut her off with a wave of his hand, “Focus on her and tell me you do not sense the same darkness within her, the same evil that consumed Ben.” Anna stood up and went to the edge of the cliff. Taking in a deep breath she struggle to calm herself. Hah. Closing her eyes, she focused on the girl. She turned her head and spoke over her shoulder, “She’s powerful. And willful… and she’s scared.” Images flashed across her eyes, vivid in places and faded in others. Snow falls, as two figures run through the woods. Smoke clouds her vision. “ VVVMMMM.” Red versus blue. Dark versus light. A scream of pain echoes off of the trees. An overpowering sense of anger fills the air. Familiar brown eyes stare into hers, before bright red fire consumes them, “You need a teacher…” A heavy hand fell on Anna’s shoulder, pulling her out of the vision. She swayed for a moment, as she gasped for air. “It’s too late, Anna.” Turning around she avoided Luke’s gaze, “It’s not too late, for Rey or for Ben.” Luke shook his head and began to head back to the hut, but she caught his arm, “Train her, please. She beat him once, without any training---.” “Imagine what you could do, then, with all your years of learning,” he said motioning to her. She glared at him, “You cannot ask that of me.” Luke pointed down the hill, “But you would ask it of her?” He shook his head, “I have trained my last apprentice. You have the tools, the knowledge, and the skills, Anna, but you’re letting your emotions get in the way of your destiny.” “Then I will teach her,” she said, defiantly. Luke raised an eyebrow, “Those who can’t do, teach.” “Then maybe the real master, should pass on his knowledge,” she said in retort. He was silent. Pulling up her hood, she started down the stairs, “Where are you going?” Luke yelled over the wind. She turned around, “To find my damn padawan.” *************************** Rey paced outside the ship, mumbling to herself. Two astromech droids stood on the ships ramp observing as the young girl seethed. Unbeknownst to her, Anna knelt behind a rock and watched her for a few moments. She looked back up the hill, the levity of the situation weighing down on her shoulders. Who was she to think she could train someone else in the Force? It was impetuous. Maybe Luke was right: she was ready to fight, but the role of being a teacher was still beyond her grasp. This was unwise, and risky. On the other hand, the old man had not tried to stop her. Something was not right about this. She did not want to take the girl on as an apprentice. She knew she was not ready. Could this just be another test? With a sigh, she let a gloved hand travel down her face, wiping away the rain. Ben, her heart sunk at the thought of him. Shaking her head, Anna pulled her hood up, so that it covered her light blue eyes, and cracked her neck. Here goes nothing. Standing up, she started down the steps, keeping her hands in plain view. The knight moved silently as though she was stalking prey, the benefit of years spent hunting for sustenance, and her master’s numerous training assessments. The only sound came from her robes that blew in the wind, but Rey’s ranting over powered the noise. “I can’t just leave,” the girl said, as she ground her teeth together. Rey threw her hands up in the air as she walked over to the edge of the cliff kicking rocks off the ledge with an infuriated groan, “Bastard,” she mumbled. Anna stepped up behind her with straight posture, and stood stock still as the larger of the two droids began to trill. Exasperated, Rey turned around, “R2 what now---?” The girl cut herself off with a gasp as her eyes fell on Anna. “Who are---hey!” Rey took a step back, her foot slipping over the edge of the cliff. Waving her arms, she struggled to keep her balance, as she looked over her shoulder at the rocks below. Anna moved like lightning. Raising her palm, she focused on the girl, through the Force. Rey started to fall back with a scream, before and invisible power pulled her back from the brink. Falling forward, she landed on her knees and scrambled back from the cliff. Anna let her arm drop, and watched the girl from beneath her hood. Standing up, Rey unhooked her lightsaber from her belt and held it at the ready. Anna cocked her head, a small smile pulling at her lips, “You really think I would attack you now? If I wanted you dead, I would have let you fall.” The girl did not move. “Who are you?” she asked again. “Someone who can help you,” Anna answered. A yell came from the ship, and before she could look, something barreled into her from the side. Flipping her body, she dug her feet into the ground as she skidded to a halt. Her hood fell back as she looked up. “Chewie, stop,” Rey said, standing in front of the Wookie, who threw his hands up in the air, as he roared. Anna stared up at the creature. “It’s been awhile, Chewbacca,” she called. The fur ball looked at her tilting his head to the side. Anna took a couple of steps towards him, as he rumbled. She chuckled as she hugged him tightly, “Yes, I think we all have some explaining to do.” Stepping back she gave a half-hearted smile, “It’s good to see you, Chewie. I heard about Han.” The Wookie looked at her sadly and grumbled. She patted him on the arm, “I know. That’s why I’m here.” Turning around she looked at the other human, “My name is Anna Kuro, I’m Master Skywalker’s…former apprentice.” Rey frowned, “He said he doesn’t teach anymore.” “He doesn’t,” Anna clasped her hands behind her back, “I completed my training with him before we were betrayed.” “You mean before Kylo Ren,” Rey said, her voice low. Anna grit her teeth, “Yes.” “You know him?” The Jedi Knight looked down at her feet, “The young man I knew is a stranger to me now. He’s changed.” Chewbacca growled beside them, but Rey cut him off, “Chewie’s right, we need Luke.” “Master Skywalker is… indisposed right now. His mind is weighed heavy with finding the First Temple.” Chewbacca and Rey looked at her in confusion, “This is only a waypoint,” Anna explained, “He’s still trying to pinpoint the temple’s exact location.” She shook her head, “He can’t help you, and even if he could, I’m not sure he wants to anymore. Losing the others…” she looked up the hill, “He’s a different man now.” Anna shifted on the balls of her feet, “You need training though,” she said looking at Rey, “You’re strong, and you have potential.” “So you think he’ll train me?” the girl asked, hope shining through her eyes. Anna shook her head, “No, he won’t… But I will.” Chapter 2 : BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE Rey ran up the path for the fifth time that morning, panting and glaring at the Jedi Knight at the top of the hill. “Is this really necessary?” she yelled as she took the steps two by two. Anna stood motionless, watching the girl run. As soon as she reached the top and turned to go back down, Anna raised her arms silently. Rey was halfway down the hill when a stone crashed into the center of her back. Stumbling forward, she let out a curse, “Fuck,” she turned around just in time to duck out of the way as another stone whizzed over her head. “What are you doing?” she yelled. A plethora of stones revolved around Anna’s head, as she stood with her arms held open and her eyes closed, “Stop the stone,” she said. Lifting her head, she threw her arm forward, sending another rock flying towards the girl. With a yell Rey dropped to the ground, as it flew past. Standing up, she jumped to the side as another stone flew inches away from the end of her nose. Anna watched as the girl dusted off her hands, and looked back up at her. Closing her hand into a fist, the knight pulled her hand back, a stone floating off of the ground behind the girl. Anna pulled the rock forward, sending it racing at the girl’s legs. Rey glared at her, “Is that it?” she yelled throwing her hands up into the air. Before she could take a step up the stairs, her feet were wiped out from under her. A sequence of curses, escaped the girl’s mouth. She landed on her back, her chest rising and falling as she struggled to catch her breath. Anna walked down the path, until she was standing over her. “Get up,” she ordered, nudging the girl’s foot. Rey opened her eyes and got up slowly, “What was that for?” she asked, holding her side. Anna stepped around her and walked further down the path, “You have a natural talent, but you rely on it too easily.” A small pebble floated up to her eye level, before coming to rest in her open palm. Turning around she held her hand out to Rey, “Take it,” she said. Rey looked at her in confusion before reaching out to take it. Anna closed her hand around the pebble, “No. Focus on it. Still yourself, and take control.” She walked over to a boulder, and crossed her legs beneath her. She held her hand out, “Take the pebble, then we’ll see where we go from there.” Rey sat a few feet away from her and stared at the rock. Sitting on her knees she held her hand out to it and closed her eyes, as she took a deep breath. Anna looked at the pebble in her palm, its smooth surface resting motionlessly against her skin. Closing her eyes she began to meditate. She is eight, skinny and tall for her age. She looks around the hall seeing other faces doing the same. The new cotton clothes scratch at her skin. A tall man, the same one who brought her here, walks to the front of the room. “I’d like to welcome all our new students, I am Master Skywalker,” he says. A boy with dark hair fidgets next to her as the man continued, “Here you will learn the ways of the Force. You will study diplomacy, history, and more.” The boy next to her raises his hand. The strange man nods his head, “Yes, Ben?” Rey, let out a groan and threw her hands up as she let her legs unfurl before her, “Why isn’t it working?” she asked, with a frown, “It worked before.” The young woman looked down at the lightsaber that hung from her belt. Anna focused on the rock, letting it levitate between the two of them, “Seeing a friend or loved one in danger, can make things seem clearer. When you overpowered Ren, you were trying to save a friend.” Rey’s brow furrowed, “How do you know tha---?” Anna manipulated the stone so that it spun in front of the other girl’s face, “The Force can show you many things, if you know how to look for it.” She let the stone fall down into Rey’s lap, “But that is a lesson for a later date.” She jerked her chin back to the ship, “Go eat, we’ll meet again this evening. Practice focusing on the stone.” With that she stood up and started up the hill, leaving her student behind. ******************************* Anna sat with her feet dangling in the clear blue water. Birds flew overhead, as the waves crashed on the beach. Run. Her feet pad along the ground, as she scrambles through the forest. Rain whips against her face as she pulls herself up the side of a tree. She scans over the foliage. No sign of---, “Vmmmmm,” she pushes herself off of the tree just before a saber comes flying at her. She ducks her head as she rolls on the ground, coming to stand on her feet. Her knees are bent as she activates her lightsaber, holding it at the ready. She watches as the blue, green sword flies back into the bushes. “Uh-oh,” she mocks, as she advances towards the spot. Raising her sword, she brings it down, cutting away at the underbrush. A dark figure leaps overhead, flipping and landing behind her. She side steps as a saber comes down on her head. Dropping low she side sweeps at her opponent’s legs. He evades her attack. A low hum fills the air, as she is blasted backwards, her head colliding with a tree. Her sword is thrown from her grasp. Then the force holding her captive disappears. She slumps forward, and falls to the ground. With a groan she sits up, her hand going to the back of her head. Red blood soaking her fingers. She looks up. Blue-green light flashes and she lunges forward, rolling out of the way. She lands on her feet, and turns to face her rival, her hands up and ready to defend. She takes a deep breath, spotting the hilt of her saber behind the man approaching her. Focusing on her weapon she wills it to her. He brings his sword down upon her head, her saber activating just in time to stop his attack mere inches away from her scalp. She stares into brown eyes before she looks up over their heads. Kicking him in the chest she covers her face as she strikes at the tree above them. Fiery sparks rain down on them, and he lets out a yell. Spinning around she kicks at his hand, his sword flying up into the air, as he falls to his knees. Catching the saber she crosses them, holding them inches away from his neck. She pants as she deactivates the swords. Leaning down she runs her fingers through his hair, a playful smile on her lips, “You’ll have to do better than that, Ben,” she whispers in his ear. “You got lucky,” he said, shaking his head. His mouth was in a hard line, but his eyes shined in amusement. “Hmmm, not yet,” she said wiggling her eyebrows. They laugh together, as he reached behind her head. She winces at the touch, and he pulls back his hand only to be caught by her own. She tilts her head, her eyes focused on his lips---. Someone claps their hands together behind them, and they break apart. Holding out her hand she helped the young man to stand, and they turned around together. “Uncle,” Ben said quietly. Luke smiles at both of them, “You’ve both come a long way, I think it’s time---.” Someone cleared their throat from behind her. Shaken from her thoughts, Anna turned around. “It’s a little early to be working on telekinesis, isn’t it?” Luke asked, coming to sit beside her. She kept her eyes focused on the water. “It’s not too late for you to take over. I’m sure I haven’t damaged her too much,” she kicked her feet in the water before adding, “Yet.” “Just keep in mind that everyone has their limits. Even you.” Anna looked up at the sky, “I have more limits than most. Rey is strong.” Luke nodded his head, “Strength will serve her well, but whether she can learn to control herself is what concerns me.” The knight laughed, “I think you said the same thing about a number of your students…” she trailed off as her master looked off into the distance. His eyes dulled, and she instantly regretted her words, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to---.” Luke waved her off, “No-no it’s fine. You’re right.” With a sigh he stood up. “Is there anything new?” Anna asked, “With the temple?” He shook his head, “We’re no closer today than we were yesterday.” Something snapped behind them. Turning around, they found Rey, staring at them sheepishly. Silently Luke pulled up his hood and passed her by, wordlessly, as he started up the trail. The girl’s eyes followed him until he disappeared. Anna cleared her throat, getting Rey’s attention. Nodding her head, she motioned to the seat beside her. Quietly Rey, sat next to her, turning the pebble over in her palm. Anna raised her eyebrow as it levitated between them, before coming to rest in the girl’s palm once more. “Good,” she said with a small smile, “Very good. Keep practicing.” Rey stuck the pebble in her pocket before turning back to Anna. “Rey, what do you know about the Jedi?” she asked. Chapter 3 : BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE Black boots, landed on the sandy surface, as Anna jumped down from her x-wing cockpit. Circling the ship she waited for her TX-0 astromech droid to lower to the ground. As it rolled over to her she patted its solar panel, “Next time you can fly, TX.” Unlike many of the other apprentices she had always hated flying. A heavy gust of wind rattled the flaps of the ship. Turning around she cringed as the wings shook, “Flying is for droids.” TX chortled as they started towards the town. “Well then, next time you can go with Ben,” Anna laughed. She thought back on their final test, nearly four months before. Silently she hands him his lightsaber as they walk down the halls, Master Skywalker leading the way. “The two of you have come far.” He looks over his shoulder, “Even though she did beat you, Ben,” his uncle says with a grin. Ben looks off to the side. As soon as Luke’s back is turned Anna nudges the boy in the side, one eyebrow raised. She moves her mouth silently, “Are you okay?” Ben rolls his eyes and elbows her back. “We’re knights now,” he whispers in her ear, and she holds back a laugh, her heart racing at the thought. The three of them enter the computer hall, coming to a stop before the holo table. Luke waves his hand and two systems are projected into the air, “As a testament to your accomplishments, you will both carry out a mission independently.” Anna and Ben look at one another as Luke continues, “So, who wants to pick?” Ben steps back, and bows as he gestures with one hand to the hologram, “Ladies first.” Between the two systems, she had chosen the one she was most familiar with letting Ben take the uncharted system. Out of the two of them, they both knew, he was more daring. Her journey had led her to Tatooine, in search of an ancient artifact left behind by the old Jedi Order. She had kept in contact with the Academy, but Ben had all but disappeared. Anna sighed. As soon as she was done with her business here, she would try to find him. She pulled up her hood, as a Rodian yelled at her. She rolled her shoulders, forcing herself to clear her mind and focus on the mission, as she and the droid made their way through the market. “I think this is it, TX,” she said looking up at the shop sign. Walking up the steps she repeated a mantra in her mind, please let this be it, please let this be it. ***************** It was something she struggled with all the time, but when the clerk had failed to produce the artifact, she needed to let her energy out. “Damn it,” she hissed as she kicked a trash box over. Four months, almost five, spent following lead after lead, and still nothing. With a deep breath she walked back to the x-wing. TX chortled behind her when they reached the ship. It was time to check in with the Academy. It would be quick. The last time she had spoken to Luke had been two months before. After their last conversation, one of the apprentices was there to take her report. “Go ahead,” she said, nodding her head at the droid. Pulling back her hood, she placed her hands behind her back. After a few moments Luke’s projection stands in front of her, “Master Skywalker,” she begins, her voice full of surprise, but he cuts her off. “Anna, you need to come back to the temple.” He looks down for a moment. Slowly he raises his head, “It’s Ben.” ************************************** Anna raced down the temple halls, “Where is he?” she asked as she ran toward the med-bay doors. A group of students stood in front of the room, blocking the way. Gritting her teeth she pushed her way in between the teens, “Let me through,” she commanded. A younger apprentice grabbed her by the shoulders and held her back, “Master Luke said no one is to enter the infirmary.” Anna ignored him and pushed the student out of the way. Murmurs and whispers run through the crowd as Luke exits the infirmary. Anna freezes. Luke looks around the group, “You all have studies to attend to. Please be on your way.” The students quickly dispersed, emptying the hall, leaving Anna and Luke behind them. She stepped up to him, “Is he---?” Luke held his hand out to her, “He’s alive, but barely.” Anna leaned against the wall, “What happened?” she asked. Luke shook his head, “Remnants of the Empire. They must have intercepted his ship… It’s bad Anna.” She looked to find him looking at her. He looks exhausted, she thought. “They did things to him, there’s no telling what,” Luke sighed and wiped his face, “We have him sedated, but he may not recover.” The hall went silent. “Can I see him?” she whispered. “Anna…” “Please!” she said too loudly, her voice echoing throughout the chamber. Luke shook his head and shrugged, “You two are close.” He thought for a moment, “Just, prepare yourself.” Turning around, he showed her into the infirmary. ********* She washed her hands, and pulled on a clean smock. Luke walked in front of her as they walked towards the room. Two people, a man and a woman, stood at the door. The woman turned around, “Luke…” she said, tears spilling over her cheeks. Master Skywalker wrapped his arms around her, “I’m sorry Leia.” Letting her go, he turned to the teen, “This is a friend of Ben’s---.” “Anna,” the other man said nodding his head. He gave a melancholy smile, and wrapped an arm around Leia, “Ben talks a lot about you.” “This is Han, Ben’s father,” Luke explained. Anna looked at the couple, seeing fragments of Ben distributed between them. She nodded and fidgeted under their gaze. What could she say? “Nice to meet you! All it took was your son nearly dying!” Clearing her throat she glanced at her master, “May I see him, please?” she asked, her chest tightening with each beep that came from the room. Luke nodded and stepped aside. Walking past them, she stepped over the threshold. The room was cool, and quiet, except for the sound of the respirator, and the heartbeat monitor. A med-droid moved back from the bed, where ben laid almost lifelessly, except for the rhythmic rise and fall of his chest. A sheet was pulled up over his stomach. Stepping closer she looked at his face, his eyes were black and swollen. There were bandages wrapped around his arms and torso, blood seeping through a few of them. He was thinner than the last time she had seen him. His collarbone and ribs more apparent beneath his skin. His left hand was wrapped in a cast, braces on his fingers. His sword arm remained unscathed, lying next to him on the bed. Anna pulled a stool next to the bed, and laid her hand on top of his. She glanced back at the door, Han and Leia watching her every move. She looked back at the young man on the bed. His hair was longer, black waves against the stark white pillow. She traced the lines of his palm as she looked at him. Hot tears fell down her face as she sat there, just staring at him. “I’m so sorry, Ben,” she whispered. A hand rested on her shoulder, and she looked up startled. She wiped her tears on her sleeve as Luke stood next to her. She looked down at Ben’s hand, “I should have gone,” she said. “Then I would be sitting here with Ben telling him there was nothing he could have done either. He’s strong, Anna. It will take time, but he will overcome this.” *********************************** Breathe . Anna sat in the meditation chamber, with her eyes closed, several of the younger padawans surrounding her. She was the eldest at eighteen, the youngest being twelve. “Focus,” she murmured as the student next to her dropped his stone with a heavy thud. She grit her teeth, as an itch climbed up her spine. Her hands squeezed together. I shouldn’t be here. “Anna, there’s nothing you can do here,” Luke said, “It’s been a month.” She looks at Ben’s face as he sleeps. Leia and Han lay asleep on the couch. Ben’s face is mostly healed, and the med-droid says they can take the cast off in a week or so. “I want to be here when he wakes up,” she says. Someone coughed, and her yes flew open, looking to the door. Luke stood at the threshold. Silently, he motioned for her to follow him, as he exited the room. The student next her toppled the pile of rocks over, and everyone let out a groan. Anna stood up and cleared her throat, “Try again,” she said as she exited the room in a run. Luke stood out in the hallway waiting for her, “What’s wrong?” she asked. “He’s awake.” ******************* Anna ran down the hall, skidding to a stop in front of the room. Ben’s parents stood in front of her blocking her view. Luke came to stand next to her, clearing his throat. Han turned around motioning for her to come in. The bed was straightened up, the respirator was turned off and put away. Quietly, she stood next to Leia, as brown eyes caught hers. She gave a small smile. Ben said nothing. His face was impassive, as he looked at her. It was like he was looking straight through her. As though she did not even exist. She stared back at him, her smile faltering. He turned his head to the med-droid, “When can I get out of here?” he asked. The droid rambled off several statistics, but Ben cut it off, “ WHEN ?!” he yelled. A glass of water was crushed on the table next to him, the glass pulverized in seconds. Anna jumped back, as a wave of anger washed over her. An anger that was not her own. She tries to focus on his aura, she tries to calm him down. It burns. He hangs from a wire wrapped around his hands, the metal cutting into his wrists. Blood, runs down his arms. “Anna, stop.” Han frowned, “Ben…” The boy sat up, “Just go,” he said. Luke tapped Anna on the shoulder, “Maybe you should go.” She looked back at the young man in the bed, but he refused to look at her. Leia spoke up, “Maybe we can come back later,” her voice sounded hopeful. Ben crossed his arms, “Just leave me alone,” he looked over at Anna, “All of you.” They stared at him. His hands started shaking, and the IV next to him began to rattle, “I said, GET OUT!” Silently the group exited the room, pulling the door closed behind them. Anna stared at the door as the three adults talked amongst themselves, “He’s so angry,” Leia said, as Han placed a hand on her shoulder. “It’s to be expected,” Luke said with a sigh, “What he’s been through… We have no idea what they did to him.” “But he was fine until…” They looked over at Anna. She cringed. So, it’s my fault, she thought, I did that to him? Anna walked down the hall. Luke and Han called after her, but she ignored them. She waved her hand, moving the door out of her way. As soon as she was in the main Hall she took off in a sprint. “Kuro,” a youngling called as she passed them by. Anna ran out of the temple, pushing her way past an incoming group of students. Sunlight burned her eyes, and she covered her face as she ran down the steps. TX whistled as she passed by the hanger. She held her hand out, forcing the droid to turn away. Pulling up her hood, she walked towards the plains. They were flat, and she could see mountains in the distance. She walked down the path, making her way through over the low lying brush. A flock of birds flew overhead. She was close. She looked behind her, the Temple still huge, though she was quite a long ways from it. They would leave her alone. She could take care of herself. A few hundred yards ahead of her she could see the lake. She pushed herself into another run, racing towards the blue water. Once she reached the edge of the lake, she took a hard right, as she pulled off her boots. “You can’t catch me!” Anna came to a halt. Boots and robes lay on the beach as she swims in the lake. Coming up for air, she looks around wildly. The lake is calm, except for the tiny ripples and splashes she makes with her own body. She pants, as her lungs fill with oxygen. “Ben?” she yells looking around. She lets out a scream, as a hand closes around her ankle, pulling her beneath the water’s surface. She kicks and yells underneath the water, wrestling away from him. Together they burst up to the surface. She gasps for air as he laughs. Anna scowls, forcing a huge wave over to him. “Asshole!” she yells. When the water stills she starts to make her way back to shore, Ben following closely behind as she scowls. “Anna,” he says, is voice filled with laughter. She turns her back to him, a small smile tugging at her lips. He grabs her by the wrist forcing her to look at him. She avoids his gaze, forcing her mouth into a hard line. His hands slips over her skin, winding their way around her waist. “Hey, it was just a joke,” he says quietly. She refuses to look up at him, and he sighs, “Look, I’m sorry---.” Before he can finish, a wall of water rises up between the two of them, forcing them apart. With a yell, it comes crashing down on his head. Anna let out the laugh she had been holding back as he came up to the surface, his face showing his alarm. His eyes narrowed as they fell on her. She stood up, the water coming to rest just below her navel, and she raised an eyebrow at him, as she bared herself to his ardent gaze. She stood still, her hands hanging down at her sides, simply staring at him. The sunlight glinted off of the drops of water that slid down and over her skin. Before she could say anything, he was in front of her, pressing his hard, heated body up against her. She wrapped her arms around his neck, as he leaned down, their lips crashing together. He bent her back, one hand settling on her waist, the other tangling in her hair. She let out a moan as he kissed his way to her collarbone, “Ben…” Anna gasped as he picked her up, wrapping her legs around him. Still holding her he made his way up the beach. She forced him to look up at her, as she held his face between her soft hands. Tilting her face, she kissed him, flitting her tongue across his lips. Then, she was falling backwards. Quietly, Ben laid her down on their clothes, and knelt over her, running his hands up and down her body. She wrapped her hands around his strong back, feeling his muscles ripple beneath his skin, as he leaned down to whisper in her ear, “I love you, Anna.” ******************************************************************* Three moons shone down on the lake, as Anna sat by herself. It was late, a little after midnight, judging by the smallest moon’s placement in the sky. She looked up at the stars and let out a heavy sigh. She was letting her attachment to Ben supersede her duty. Running away… had only served to show that she still had much to learn. As for Ben himself? She shook her head remembering how he had looked at her. Hate, spite, and cruelty. That was not the Ben she knew… The Ben she loved. Standing up, she dusted off her robes, and pulled her boots back on. Pulling up her hood she started on the trek back to the temple. ******************************************************************** The world was silent as she made her way up the steps. She kept her head bowed, avoiding the gaze of the figure, sitting at the top of the stairs. With a sigh, she sat next to Luke. “Did you have a nice walk?” he asked quietly. Anna closed her eyes, “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have run away like that.” Luke waved her off, “You’re young, Anna. I was your age once, you know.” He looked off in the distance before murmuring, “Seeing someone you care for, hurting like that… If I had known, I wouldn’t have let you in to see him.” The girl looked over at him, “Is it true? Ben was acting fine until I got there?” Luke sighed, “Anna, when I found him he was almost dead. He should have been dead.” “It’s a simple yes or no, Luke,” Anna said glaring at him. “Yes.” He looked at her, his eyes full of pity, “Do you remember when we talked about torture techniques?” Anna gave a stiff nod, as Luke continued, “It’s difficult but if you can make someone think they’re being hurt by a loved one… It can be effective in turning the prisoner, warping their mind against their friends.” He clasped his hands together and looked down, “I caught a glimpse of what they did to him, Anna,” he paused, and closed his eyes before looking back up at her, “He thinks it was you. In Ben’s mind, you are the one who caused him all of this pain.” She frowned, “I wasn’t even there, I was on Tatooine, you know that---.” Luke cut her off, “I know that you would never hurt him, you couldn’t. But to Ben…” She looked away, “I can’t go back in there… Can I?” she asked as she rose from the stairs. “No. You cannot.” Chapter 4 : BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE Three months later… They flew down, with their light turned off, the way only lit by the moon overhead. “Why is it always sand?” Anna murmured as she set the ship down on the edge of a steep hill. TX tweeted behind her, shaking in its console. Anna shook her head looking at the bunker on the cliff below them, lights revolving, imperial troopers manning a series of gun stations. “Stay here, I may need a quick ride out of here.” Removing her helmet, she pushed a series of buttons, the cockpit opening with a hiss. She slid down the ladder, her feet sending up a plume of dust. Holding her arm up, she tapped a code into her wrist band. With the code complete a small green light reflected off of her skin. “Can you hear me?” she asked looking back at the droid. TX whistled. “Good,” Anna said wrapping her cloak around her body, “I’ll keep in touch.” She walked to the edge of the hill and crouched down. Opening her palm she looked at the plans she had stolen a week before. The vault was in the top of the bunker. She would have to climb through vents to get there though. Retracing and planning her attack, she put the hologram back into her pocket. Narrowing her eyes she looked down the hill. There were fifteen armed guards patrolling the bunker’s perimeter. She had no way of telling how many were inside though. Pulling up her hood, she stood up, “Let’s make this quick,” she said before sliding down the side of the hill. ******************************** Twenty minutes later, and she was inside the base. Alarms flashed, but they were still silent. They knew she was there, she could hear them searching for her. Crouching down, she pulled and unscrewed one of the ventilation grates. She set it down to the side with a heavy thud, wincing at the sound. “Did you hear that?” a voice asked. Around the corner. Quickly she climbed inside the vent, lifting the cover behind her. The sound of marching footsteps approached. “Lg-1724, said it was a Jedi,” a Stormtrooper said as they passed her by. “He’s hearing things again. No one’s seen a Jedi since the Death Star.” The troopers slowly disappeared down the hall, and Anna let out a sigh. Letting go of the grate, she started to climb. Anna… She stopped. Her stomach dropped, and she gasped as a myriad of voiced called out to her. Run… She shook her head, and reached for the next rung on the ladder. A voice echoed through the vents, “Hey, over here! They went this way.” A series of thuds followed the voice. Anna looked up, Great, they were in the vents with her. Picking up the pace she jumped into the next vent. Crawling forward she came to a hallway. Bracing her feet against the metal, she pushed, until the grate fell, Anna catching it just before it met the floor. With a sigh she stepped out into the hallway. She looked at the blueprints once more. Sticking close to the wall she walked until the corridor forked. She took a hard left, the vault supposedly being straight ahead. She walked up to the doors. Vmmmm . She whirled around activating her sword. Anna raised the saber up to block, but the blow never came. She frowned. There was nothing there. The hall was empty. Shaking her head, she turned back to the door. Lifting her sword she plunged it into the deep metal. Sparks rained down onto the floor as she started from the bottom of the door, going counter-clockwise in her cutting. “There she is,” a voice said behind her. A blaster rifle fired, and Anna yanked her lightsaber out of the door, blocking the shot. The hallway was filled with troopers, taking their aim. Gritting her teeth she advanced towards them. “Halt,” one of them commanded. Anna lifted her hand, sending the trooper flying back, hitting several soldiers behind him. That is when they started shooting. Anna ducked plunging her sword into a nearby trooper. Holding him up, she used him as a shield, before pushing him back into the group, knocking several troopers off of their feet. Spinning around she cut down another two soldiers, blocking a series of shots, and repelling several of them back at the soldiers. As her saber danced in front of her, she looked up. Lifting a hand she focused on the blast doors. Closing her hand into a fist she pulled downwards, slamming the doors closed. Several screams echoed from the other side of the door, as legs and arms were caught as the door closed. Deactivating her sword, she walked over to one of the dead troopers on her side. After rummaging she stood up tossing a silver orb into the air. With a flick of her thumb, she pressed a button before rolling it over to the vault door. She ran to the side and covered her ears. BOOM!!!! The bunker shook from the blast. Pulling her scarf over her nose, she stood up, and walked through the smoke. Electricity flashed and sparks rained down from above. She jumped over a hunk of metal and rubble, and entered the vault. Lights flashed and she held up a flare. There were computer archives, artifacts from before the Empire, but what she really sought sat in the middle of the room. With a wave of her hand, she pushed several collapsed computer cases out of her way, before proceeding. On the center dais an old data pad. Anna stretched her hand out---. “Oh yes, you will do very nicely,” a voice echoed throughout the chamber. Anna grabbed the data, and spun around, holding her lightsaber. Its purple light illuminated the room slightly. “Who’s there?” Anna yelled, her voice muffled from her scarf. “An interested party. With you and the other Jedi, the First Order will be unstoppable.” Anna glanced around the room as she made her way over to the door. “Yes, run. You are out of time…” Anna took the voice’s advice and ran like hell. ************************************************************ They were in orbit, “This is Anna Kuro, ID 184-159-367, requesting permission to land.” No answer. Anna frowned. Punching the console, she tried again, “Come in base. This is Anna Kuro, 184-159-367, requesting permission to land.” Still no answer. TX chortled. Anna shook her head. Something was not right. She could feel it, like a knife twisting in her gut. “Take us home, TX.” The droid took them out of orbit, and they quickly descended into the atmosphere. Anna tried contacting the academy but there was still no answer. TX started whistling and she looked up. In the distance a great plume of smoke rose up into the air. Anna switched on the deflector shields, “Keep us low, TX.” They made a quick sweep of the temple, which remained intact. The hanger on the other hand had been completely razed to the ground. “Over there,” Anna said, pointing to an open space. Once they were down on the ground, Anna jumped out of the x-wing. She looked around, her heart racing. Bodies littered the fields, younglings and apprentices a year or so younger than herself among them. The stench of death filled her nostrils. She walked over to one of the tiny bodies: a little girl, almost eight. The marks of a saber marred her tiny torso. Anna looked away. Whoever had done this, was brutal yet quick. The girl had not suffered long. Anna looked to the temple, drawing her sword. Taking the steps two-by-two she made it to the top, activating her sword. Holding out her hand, she focuses and forced the doors open. The main hall was silent, more bodies lying on the floor. At the center of the room, the floor had been melted and hacked to pieces. She knelt down running her fingers over the granite. Whoever had done this, was strong. Anna closed her eyes. A dark presence filled this place. “Looks like we missed one,” an electronic voice echoed throughout the hall. Anna stood slowly and looked behind her. Six figures surrounded her. Anna raised her saber, readying herself to defend. “Oh, look, we got ourselves a real knight,” the center figure said, hefting a large cannon in his arms. Taking aim, he shot a grenade at her. Anna held out her hand, sending the projectile flying right back the shooter. The others jumped away, but her target was not so lucky. With a yell he exploded into a million pieces. The blast knocked Anna back. She sat up, her ears ringing, and her eyes blurring together. She looked up, just as a metal fist came down at her. Flipping over, she swiped at her opponent’s ankle with her blade. A scream echoed throughout the chamber. Anna circled the masked man, as he tried to stand up. Stepping behind him Anna let out a grunt as she stabbed him in the center of the back. With a groan he fell to the ground and she yanked the blade from his lifeless body. Standing she bent her knees, one hand in open in front, the other holding her bald behind her, ready to strike. The remaining four advanced. Anna yelled blocking bolts as one of them opened fire, the other two lunging at her. Summoning her strength she pushed one, sending him flying back into a wall, as her blade clashed against the vibroblade of another. She spun around blocking shots and blows, unable to do anything but attack. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw their ally, leaning against the wall, pointing his pistol at her. She froze, giving him a clear shot. The bolt raced towards her, a blinding flash of blue. At the last second she jumped out of the way. A voice gasped behind her. Flipping over she continued, to block shots as the swordsman fell to the ground, a hole burning through his chest. A yell sounded to her left, and she turned towards it, one of the men running towards her, the man’s sword raised high. Anna threw her saber at him, letting it spin. The man did not stand a chance. The lightsaber, slipped through his armor, slicing through his flesh. Anna ran pulling her saber back to her. There was only one left, and he yelled, running towards the door. He was fast. Anna was faster. Focusing, she summoned the force, propelling herself forward in a sprint. She raced up behind him, stabbing him in the leg with her sword. The man screamed as he fell to the ground. He reached for his gun, but the Jedi Knight kicked it away. She ripped off his helmet, and bent down, placing her knee on his chest, as she pulled him up by his throat, to face her. He was only a little older than her, human, with a thin scar running down the side of his cheek. “Who are you?” she said, her voice breathless. “Fuck you,” the man spat. Anna placed more of her weight on him. He groaned and gasped for air. “I said, tell me who you are!” CRACK! Anna gasped and jumped away, as the man’s neck turned at an unnatural angle. Slowly his body floated up, before flying over her head. Anna spun around. A thud resounded throughout the room, as the body landed at the feet of another dark figure. She grit her teeth and drew her sword. A deep voice echoed across the room to her, “It seems even the Knights of Ren cannot stand against you, Kuro.” Vmmmmm. A blood red lightsaber appeared. It was different from anything she had ever seen, with a red, cross guard. Anna frowned and pulled off her robe, “Who are you?” “Don’t you recognize me?” the voice asked, striding closer to her. “Should you?” she asked. “Maybe you never really knew me at all, then.” “So who goes first?” she asked. The man in the mask bowed, “Ladies first.” Anna cocked her head, and let her arm fall to her side, “Ben?” she asked in horror. The man reached up and tapped the side of his mask. With a hiss he removed it, black locks framing his face. Letting it fall to the ground he looked at her. Anna gasped. Fiery red eyes stared at her. “Ben Solo, is dead. My name,” he said punctuating every syllable, “Is Kylo Ren.” Anna stood before him in shock, barely registering that he was readying to attack her. With a yell he brought his sword down upon her head. At the last minute she blocked his strike, her knees buckling under the full strength of his attack. She stumbled back, as he kicked her, “You’re weak,” he said, swinging his sword at her with both hands tightly around the hilt. Anna threw her hand forward trying to push him back with the force. He was stronger. A force gripped her by the throat, lifting her off of the ground. She choked, as she clawed at her neck. Her vision blacked out. A flash of green lit up the room, and she fell to the floor. “Ben…” she said gasping for air. Looking up she saw two figures fighting a few feet away from her. “Anna!” a voice yelled. She stood up. Luke stood locked together with Ben. His eyes flitted over to her, “Run!” With a yell, he pushed Ben back, the boy’s head colliding with rock. He fell to the ground, and Anna started to run towards him, but Luke caught her. “Come on, we have to go.” On the ground Ben’s body began to stir. Following Master Skywalker’s lead she ran from the temple. A yell echoed from behind him, and she looked back to see Ben following after them. Anna ran down the stairs. “Get in,” Luke ordered as they got closer to the x-wing. She scrambled up the ladder. Luke climbed in after her. “TX, get us out of here,” she yelled as she strapped herself in. She looked out the window as they took off. The last time she saw Ben Solo, he was razing the temple of the New Jedi Order to the ground. ************************************************************ Anna hung onto the cliff for dear life. She groaned and looked up at the sky, Well, it can’t get much worse. Scaling down the side of the cliff she let go, falling a few feet until she was on the rocky shore. Waves crashed on the rocks, spewing mist into the air. Crouching down, she made her way over along the rock face, staying out of sight. Cold water trickled, down on her head, and she pulled up her hood with a shudder. Straightening her back she walked along the shore, hunting for her quarry. Flashes of a presence came to her, before disappearing all together. “I know you’re there,” she called into the trees, “I see we need to work more on your control,” she taunted. Shaking her head she walked into the forest, her eyes scanning the area. She felt the presence again, and turned to the right, “Poor little Rey, it seems talent does not make up for experience.” A yell sounded above Anna’s head, and she turned just in time to block Rey’s strike. Their lightsabers clashed in an explosion of blue and purple light. Anna pushed the girl away, spinning her saber in her hand. She lunged. Rey met her blow for blow, giving no quarter to her attacks. The girl ran forward, holding out her hand. A burst of force, blew the knight back against a tree. Stunned she looked up just in time to see Rey swinging at her head. Anna rolled to the side, coming to her feet. Rey sliced through the tree, missing her mark. With a groan the tree fell, shaking the ground. Anna focused on a large boulder, sending it flying at the girl. With a yell, Rey sliced through it, smoke and dust filling the air. The younger of the two turned around, her eyes burning with rage. Anna lowered her sword, “Control yourself,” she ordered. Rey lowered her lightsaber, and closed her eyes. When she opened them the fury had vanished. Anna deactivated her sword, as Rey followed suit. Anna sighed and pinched the bridge between her eyes, “Come on, Rey. We’ve talked about this.” Rey crossed her arms, “What’s so wrong about it? It’s like you want me to be emotionless.” “No, emotions are a part of you,” Anna said. With a sigh she looked up at the sky, “But they can be your undoing. “I know.” “Then why must I keep saying it?” Anna asked, raising her voice. Rey looked away, and Anna shook her head, “Just--- head back to camp. We’re done for today.” Silently, Rey stalked past her. Anna watched her leave, as she paced back and forth beneath the trees. “You worry that she is too angry,” a voice said behind her. Anna turned and let out a sigh. “You always show up at the best of times, don’t you?” Luke inclined his head, “Would you prefer that I was here at the worst of times?” “Somewhat,” Anna turned back towards the ocean, “She’s very willful.” Luke laughed, “She’s come a long way in four months, but not far enough, I sense, for you.” “She isn’t ready, and I only have so much I can teach her,” she looked over her shoulder at him, “She needs a real teacher, not some washed up knight.” “Some of the best masters were washed up knights.” Anna spun around, “Why won’t you teach her!?” she yelled. “The girl has her teacher, Anna. Ask and I will offer guidance, but---.” Anna stood right in front of him, “It I send that,” she said pointing the way Rey had left, “He will send her back to me in pieces!” “Then fight Ben yourself,” Luke said, his voice and gaze remaining unchanged as he looked at her. Anna stepped back, her voice breathless, “No.” She shook her head, and backed away. Luke stepped towards her, “You’re afraid, Anna, I understand, but you can only run so far, before---.” “No!” she yelled. The forest was silent, as she and Luke stood still. A sharp pain twisted in her gut, and she shook her head, “I. Can’t.” She grit her teeth and looked away, “I won’t.” She took in a deep breath, feeling the tightness in her chest unwind and settle. She breathed out slowly, her hands shaking. “I’m not afraid of him. I’m-,” Anna crouched down, “I’m afraid of myself.” Luke knelt in front of her, and rested a hand on her shoulder. Slowly she looked up at him, “You can’t ask me to kill him,” she whispered, shaking her head, “Because I won’t. That’s why it has to be Rey.” Luke shook lifted her hand, “I don’t want you to kill him Anna. None of us do. We need you to save him.” Chapter 5 : BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE Anna scrubbed at the old droid as R2-D2 tweeted behind her. Rey walked up to her, “What are you doing?” she asked. “Is Chewie ready yet?” Anna asked glancing over at the girl. Rey nodded, “What aren’t you telling me?” she asked, “You just said I needed to learn more.” Standing up, Anna dusted her hands off, “And you do. We’re just not going to do it here.” Turning around she walked over to a large shape covered in canvas and leaves. Grabbing the corner of the fabric she pulled. TX tweeted behind her, coming to life, as she and Rey stared up at the ship. “It’s old,” Anna said, “And a little rusty, but I’m sure your resistance could find a use for it.” Rey was speechless, “We-we’re going back?” Anna nodded, “It’s time we made things official.” She pointed her finger at the girl, “You still have a lot to learn, but… We can continue your training with the resistance.” Rey smiled, for the first time in weeks, and Anna patted TX’s head as the droid rolled over next to her, “This time,” she whispered to the droid, “I’m flying us out of here.” *************************************************************** “Rey, you lead us in,” Anna said over the communication system, as they broke out of orbit. Rey’s reply came back over the system, as Anna fidgeted with her scarf. Rey was one thing, but the thought of suddenly being around large groups of people, was worrying her. Three years was a long time to go without contact with people, other than an old man, who was content to study by himself. Chewie said something over the comms, and Anna looked up to see two x-wings flying next to them. An unfamiliar voice came spoke in her ear, “This is Poe Dameron, stick close to me, it gets a little tricky on the way to the surface.” Anna took control of the stick as all four ships took a hard left, entering the atmosphere. The first thing she noticed was that her jaw was shaking from the force of the turbulence. TX whistled, and she spoke through grit teeth, “Angle that deflector shield.” Clouds burst over the wind shield, and she looked at the sensor readout. Poe’s voice rang out in her ear, “Pull up!” With a gasp she pulled back on the stick, TX screaming as they jerked form side to side. “I know, I know,” she yelled, as she leveled out. She looked out her window, as the clouds cleared. One of the x-wings flew up alongside her, “Nice boat,” Poe said, “Where’d you get it?” Anna rolled her eyes, “Trade secret.” Poe was silent. Anna cringed, Okay, this is awkward. “Well, we’ll see if we can fix up your trade secret.” “Hey it’s not that bad,” she said. “What’s that? I can’t hear you over your TX model.” The droid tweeted behind her snidely, and she grinned, “You tell him, TX.” As she looked ahead, there was a break in the clouds, and she gazed at the planet. It was covered in snow, and ice, deep mountains marred the landscape. A new voice came over the comms, “Welcome to Base 186792. Continue on your present course.” ************************************************ Anna climbed down the ladder, leaving her helmet in the ship. TX whistled as it was lowered to the ground. She pulled back her hair as she walked to the front of the ship, a cold wind blowing over her skin. Damn, it’s cold. Shivering she pulled her cloak closed, and pulled up her hood. “Anna,” Rey called, running over to her. She grinned, as they walked to the bunker. A group of people joined them. A dark haired man held his hand out to her, “Poe Dameron, nice to meet you.” She gave him a firm handshake. “Anna Kuro,” she yelled over the wind. He smiled, “The General will want to talk to you,” he looked past her at Rey, “Both of you.” When they made it through the hanger bay doors, Poe turned to them, “I’ll show you the way.” Anna turned to see Chewbacca lumbering off into the base, R2 following closely behind. TX waddled next to her. “Is it okay if I bring my droid?” she asked, “He has information for the general.” Poe nodded, “Sure.” They walked up the stairs, as he told him about the base, “We’re still taking care of some things but it’s all pretty much set up” Rey cleared her throat as they walked down the hallway, “Is Finn?” Poe grinned, “We’ll stop by there later. He’s excited to see you.” They came to a door and he stepped aside, “Ladies first.” Anna froze, as Rey walked into the room. She turned around, “Are you alright, Anna?” She shook her head, as Poe and Rey looked at her, “I’m fine.” Rey and Poe looked at one another, but she walked past them. The room was busy, with people running around, speaking through mikes, and working at computer consoles. They walked to the center of the room. A group of people stood around a large holo table, plans and blueprints flashing in the air. Poe cleared his throat and the group looked over at them. A woman stepped through the crowd her eyes falling on Anna. When she met the woman’s gaze her heart clenched. General Organa, said something to the man next to her and the group quickly dispersed. Slowly she made her way around the table. She walked past Rey until she stood in front of Anna, and she began raising her hand slowly. Anna flinched as Leia rested a cold palm against her cheek. Leia smiled, “It’s really you, isn’t it?” Anna gave a silent nod, before the older woman pulled her into her arms. Anna buried her face in her shoulder as tears pricked at her eyes, “I’m so sorry,” she whispered, as fat, hot tears fell down her face. It was the first time she had cried in over three years. Leia leaned back, looking up into Anna’s eyes, and shook her head, “There is nothing to forgive.” ************************** Anna and Leia sat next to each other, as the young woman recounted the events of the past three years. “I was weak,” Anna said, staring out the window, “I-I couldn’t stop him, and now Han---.” The resistance general laid a hand on her shoulder, “It was not your mistake to fix. Ben was lost even before Luke rescued him.” She sighed, “Speaking of my brother, I don’t suppose he’ll be coming here anytime soon?” Anna shook her head, and waved TX over to her. She punched in a code, and the droid began to project Luke’s message. “ Leia ,” he said, “I’m not sure where to begin.” He looked down, “ Rey, told us about Han… and Ben. I wish I could be there with you, but we’re close. Finding the temple is imperative.” The old Jedi Master looked up, his face full of pain, “It’s the only way to start to make things right. I’ve sent Anna Kuro, you’ll remember her. She’s been training Rey…” Luke paused, as the recording recalibrated, “---Can’t train her. Not after Ben, I’m sorry. Anna is strong, and smarter than she thinks. Use her, Leia, trust her. I wouldn’t send her if I was unsure of her abilities. She is the last Jedi Knight. Once Rey is formerly trained, Anna will be a master.” Anna looked down as Luke continued. “ She can stop Ben, Leia, but she needs your support.” Luke looked behind him before turning back quickly, “I have to go… I’m sorry.” TX whined as the transmission ended. Slapping her knee, Leia looked over at her. “Well, then let’s see if we can find you a job. Commander Kuro.” Anna followed behind Leia as they walked back into the control room. A Quarren walked up to her, “General, we have a situation.” Leia turned around, as Anna raised her eyebrows, “No rest for the wicked,” she said with a shrug. At the center of the room, she found Rey with Poe and another young man. As the Quarren gave the General a sitrep, Anna walked over to the group. Rey turned around, and gave a small nod. Turning around she introduced Anna to her friends, “Anna, this is Finn, I told you about him. Finn, this is Anna Kuro, Jedi Knight.” He smiled, and held out his hand, “Nice to meet you.” Anna shook his hand and turned around as Leia cleared her throat, “If we can have everyone’s attention,” she said as she nodded to the Quarren, “Captain Ara’ve.” Ara’ve cleared his throat before bringing a list of planets and systems into view, “We have received word that a small contingent of First Order scientists of the moon of Lothal. Our agents report that they are key to the building and design of the Star killer base.” The hologram zoomed in, showing an underground super structure. Leia stepped forward, “A small force could infiltrate the base,” she looked over at Anna, “Commander Kuro.” All eyes turned towards her, and she inclined her head, “Yes, General?” “You will lead this mission, choose your team, and report.” With that, they were dismissed. Anna turned to Rey, who grinned at her, “So… Commander Kuro? ” The Jedi Knight shook her head, and laughed, “Rey, are we going to stand here all day or are you going to get ready for the mission?” Rey looked at her in surprise, “I’m--?” “You might as well,” Anna turned to Finn, “Rey’s told me a lot about you. I don’t suppose you would be up for a short trip?” The boy smiled, “Count me in.” Looking around at her team Anna raised an eyebrow. “Alright then, get your gear, we’ll meet at the Falcon in an hour.” With the team dispersed she looked across the table to find Leia watching her, studying her. Straightening her back, she walked around the table. “I suppose you’ll be taking Rey, with you then?” Leia asked. Anna nodded, “She could use the experience.” “You’re sure she is ready?” “I’d rather she see actual combat now, rather than later. There’s only so much she can learn from sparring with me.” Anna crossed her arms, “I’m just wondering, why you’re letting me lead this mission.” Leia shrugged, “You’re our new asset. Think of this as an evaluation.” ******************************************* Anna sat down in the co-pilot seat with a thud. Rey came and Chewie came in behind her. “Is something wrong, Commander?” Rey asked. Anna rolled her eyes, “Rey, cut it out.” The girl sat in the other chair and started flipping switches, “What’s got you all grim and fatalistic?” Anna sighed. Everything. She stood up, “Just get us out of here, Rey.” ******************************************** Anna and Rey crouched in the tall weeds, watching as the imperial troops passed by. Boom! A plume of smoke rose into the air, as the Millennium Falcon flew overhead. Finn’s voice echoed in her earpiece, “That should get their attention!” The two Jedi looked at one another. Standing up, Anna took off in a sprint across the road, Rey following her lead. “Stay low,” Anna hissed as she crouched down. Water sloshed around her boots as they pushed through the wetlands. The sun was getting low, and darkness would soon be on their side. She ran behind a tree, unhooking her lightsaber from her belt. She looked over at Rey who was doing the same thing. Reaching out with their hands, they focused on the two guards in front. “Now,” Anna yelled. They pushed the guards against the hull of the bunker a dull thud ringing out. Taking off they ran for the door. “Cover me,” Anna said as she began to cut through the door. Rey bent her knees and scanned the forest. Two flashes of light sped towards them, and without a sight she repelled the shots, back in the direction they had come from. A yell came from the tree line. Anna looked over her shoulder, halfway through the door, “That’s one,” she said. Rey gave a stiff nod. A series of shot raced towards them, followed by a dozen more. Anna pulled her saber away from the door, helping the girl deflect the shots, “Take the door,” she ordered, stepping in front of Rey. The door opened with a whoosh, and they ran inside. “To the left,” Rey called, leading the way. She swiped at the control panel, opening the doors blocking their path. Anna looked at the blueprints in her palm, “We need to head to this cross section,” she said, “Then we can climb down this shaft.” Rey gave a stiff nod, and took off in a run. They were halfway down the hall, when they heard a blaster firing, “They went this way,” a Stormtrooper yelled. Anna pulled swiped at a control panel as they ran down the hall, closing the door behind her. Rey shook her head panting, “That won’t hold them very long,” she said. Anna patted her should as she moved past her, “Then we’ll just have to move faster, then, won’t we?” After about ten minutes they came to the cross section, and Anna stood guard as the younger girl worked on the control panel, “What’s taking so long?” she asked, shifting from one foot to another. It was only a matter of time before the Stormtroopers caught up to them. Rey spoke through the splicing tool she had in her mouth, “’m alwost un.” “What?” Rey took the tools out of her mouth, “I’m almost done--- there!” The doors opened and Anna stuck her head through them. She looked down, and grit her teeth. Rey patted her on the back, and she nearly jumped. Rey climbed through and laughed, “Don’t tell me, you’re afraid of heights.” Anna followed her through, “It’s not the height that bothers me.” She looked down, “It’s the chance of sudden death that makes me go woozy.” Rey laughed, before they started climbing down in silence. Anna counted as they went down, when they got to the eleventh level she grunted, “This is it.” Rey, climbed over to the vent grate and started unscrewing it. Once it was off she tried to push it back to the side. Anna gasped, “Watch out!” the grate wobbled on the ledge before falling, as Rey moved to the side. A loud thud echoed up the shaft a few seconds later. Rey gave a sheepish smile, “Sorry,” she whispered, before climbing into the vent. Anna followed her, “Why are you whispering now?” Rey stopped to say something back to her, but Anna just pushed her forward, “Just go.” They worked their way through the vents taking turn after turn, before Anna grabbed Rey by her ankle. The girl looked back at her in alarm, but Anna held a finger to her lips and pointed down. Pressing her ear to the floor, she listened as voices echoed through the vent. Sitting up she unhooked her lightsaber from her belt, motioning for Rey to do the same thing. Silently they sat up on their knees, pointing their lightsabers downwards. Anna gave a nod and together the activated their swords, both drawing them counter-clockwise. A scream sounded below as they dropped into the room, in a mask of smoke and dust. Anna stood up and pushed a desk back into a group of people, trapping them against the wall. “Stop,” a voice ordered behind them. Anna threw her hands up in the air, “Alright, alright. You’ve got us,” she said as she turned around. Rey turned around with her and hissed, “What are you doing?” Anna shook her head, “Wait for it,” she whispered back. As the smoke cleared a human male walked forward with a blaster pointed at them. He was pudgy, with salt and pepper hair, and frown lines around his face. “Who are you?” he asked waving the blaster around. Anna lifted her chin, “Jedi Knights of the Resistance---.” The man threw his head back and laughed, “The Jedi are extinct, who are you really?” he turned to the side, and Anna threw her hand, up sending the man, flying back into a wall. Frozen she pressed him up against the wall as she walked forward. “Rey, take their weapons.” The girl quickly piled what rifles they had in the corner of the room, herding the rest of the lab technicians on the opposite wall. Anna turned back to the man, “Who are you?” The man gasped for air as he struggled under her power, “Doctor… Carassi… Hngh.” Anna went through the names on her list. His was at the top. She turned back around and walked over to Rey, “Congratulations, Doctor, today is your lucky day.” With a wave of her hand he fell to the ground, gasping for air. As she walked by she forced everyone else to sleep. “Grab him,” she ordered Rey, handing her a blaster. Rey forced the man to stand up, sticking the barrel of the gun in his back. Anna stood in front of the door and spoke over her shoulder to the doctor, “Do as she says, and we won’t have to shoot you.” The doctor spat at her, “You can’t kill me---.” Anna whirled on him, and grabbed him by the collar of his coat, “You’re right, I can’t kill you, but I can shoot you in your kneecap. Or better yet, I can cut your legs and arms off---make the load lighter. Oh, and don’t worry about bleeding out--- have you ever heard of Jedi healing techniques?” The man shook his head, and Anna narrowed her eyes, “We slow down your bleeding, keeping you alive for hours, long enough to get you to our base. Then we take care of your injuries, but you are in pain for hours . So, shut up, and walk.” With that she turned around and punched the door lock, opening it with a hiss. Pulling up her hood she took off in a jog, down the hall. Rey and Carassi followed close behind. She looked at the Doctor, “Your security code,” she said, when they reached the elevator. The man hesitated and she activated her saber. He glared at her, “Alright, alright! BD-159230.” Anna punched in the code, breathing out a silent breath of relief. The three of them stepped inside. Rey stood next to her as they began their ascent to the surface. Anna looked over at them, “Keep a close eye on him, Rey. The closer we get to the ship the harder they’ll be working to take him out.” Carassi turned to her wide-eyed and Anna scowled, “What are you looking at?” His whole body shaking the man turned away and Rey looked up at her. She let a small smile slip out onto her face, and winked. Rey bit her lip, her eyes creasing in amusement, “Why will they be trying to take him out, Commander?” Anna crossed her arms and looked up at the display, five more levels to go. “If they can’t stop us they’ll kill our prisoner. No captive, no stolen information.” She looked over at the doctor, “It’ll probably be a sniper shot to the head, quick kill.” The elevator came to a stop and the doors opened. Stepping forward, she activated her lightsaber, and scanned the hall. “Let’s get out of here,” she said, as they ran down the hallway. ******************************************************** Rey pushed the doctor past her, as Anna covered their escape. “Run!” she yelled. “I’m trying,” she girl yelled back as she pushed the man in front of her. The man had twisted his ankle in the swamps, and was hobbling along now, severely hindering their escape. Anna deflected a shot and retreated behind them. “Rey, get Chewie’s attention, will you. We’re gonna have to move the rendezvous closer to us.” Turning around she threw up her hand, as she threw, and advancing trooper back into the trees. Looking over her shoulder she saw Rey, pushing the doctor onto the ground, “It’s going to be a few minutes,” Rey yelled over the fighting. Standing up, she pulled out her lightsaber and blocked a few shots that were coming her way. Anna backed up as a Stormtrooper began to advance on their position, his arm raising a stun sword high in the air. Rey let out a yell behind her, as the Millenium Falcon flew overhead. Coming down, the ramp opened, with Finn, coming out shooting. Rey pulled the doctor up and helped him onto the ship. Anna started to run too, but not before the Stormtrooper swung his stick at her. She ducked, slicing the back of his leg open with her sword. Falling to the ground, he let out a scream and looked up at her. Pushing him away from her she ran to the ship. ********************************************************* Inner Rim; Star Destroyer Finalizer Captain Illuim marched down the hall, as he pulled at his collar. He was not a young man, his head balding, and skin beginning to wrinkly under the strains of time, and more importantly his career choice. Standing in front of the door, he pressed on the button, as he panted for breath, a bead of sweat running down his face. The doors opened and he wiped his face before going inside. The room was dark, the only light, coming from the observation window. Illuim cleared his throat, “Milord, I have a report from the First Order’s base in the Lothal system.” The room was silent, and the Captain looked down at his data pad. “The entire base was destroyed, and there are reports Dr. Carassi was captured.” He swallowed and looked up, as a dark figure moved in front of the window, blocking out what little light had been coming through. “There were reports that a Jedi led the attack. A woman.” Suddenly he was pulled forward as a hot red, lightsaber ignited. A stone like fist closed around his throat and he struggled to breathe. A deep voice resonated throughout the room, “The girl from the forest.” Illuim shook his head, as he struggled to get away from the hand wrapped around his throat, “No-no, aaagh---.” The hand released and he fell to the floor gasping for air. Coughing he struggled for breath. Heavy footsteps walked away from him, and he looked up, “It was a different woman, hahck , older, stronger, trained---.” Stumbling the man stood up and held out the data pad, a picture of a hooded woman shot from beneath her, flashed on the screen. The data pad was ripped from his grasp, and flew through the air, a black leather fist grabbing it. Illuim, backed up as red light lit up the room. “Lord Ren,” he said as he tripped down the stairs. He held up a hand, as a saber of fire came down upon his head. Smoke and the stench of death filled the room, as the dark Jedi cleaved the man’s head from his body. Standing over the man’s body, Ren looked at the data pad, his breath panting through his mask. Deactivating his sword, he flipped on the viewer. “Lord Ren,” a man answered, holding his hand up in salute. “Send General Hux to my quarters.” He turned around waving his hand at Illuim, “And send someone to clean this up.” “Yes, milord.” The holo cut off as he walked back to the window. His hand fell down to his side the data pad spinning in the air next to him. He focused his eyes on her neck, wrapped in an intricately designed scarf: light blue with frayed edges. She stood up from the bed, pulling her robes over her body. He sat up, just as naked as she had been. His eyes traveled down the curve of her back, fighting to not grab her and pull her back underneath the sheets. With a sigh he looked over at the clock wistfully, before looking back up at her. She pushed down her hair, trying to tame the mess on her head. Swinging his legs over the edge of the bed, his fingers met hers as they both bent down for the silk scarf that laid on the floor. He looked up, her blue eyes bright in the morning light. She smirked up at him, leaning up to kiss him on the cheek. Pulling back she looked down at his hands still holding onto her scarf. She gave the garment a small tug, “Let go,” she said, her voice lilting at the end. He shook his head, and grazed his hand against her cheek, his fingers stroking back her hair. He pulled her forward, placing a kiss on her lips. A warm hand pushed against his chest, before she ran her fingers through his hair. She let out a moan. With a sigh he pulled back as she shook her head, a grin on her face. Leaning forward he tried to kiss her again, “I don’t want you to go,” he murmured. She gave him a peck on the lips before standing up, “It’s our first mission, and you’re already getting lonesome?” He frowned. She slipped her scarf away from his fingers. “Come on, nothing is going to happen. You should be excited.” Leaning down, she kissed him once more on the cheek before turning for the door, “I love you, Ben Solo,” she said as she slipped out of sight… Vmmmmmmm. Red light reflected off his mask as he let out a shuddering breath. Closing his hand into a fist he spun around, slicing through the data pad, with a guttural scream, “NOOO!” He paced back in forth in front of the window as the smoke cleared and the data pad fell to the ground in pieces. He came to a stop in the center of the window, and leaned against the wall as he reached up to pull his helmet from his face, and threw it across the room. Black hair fell over his eyes, as he hunched over, beads of sweat streaming down his face. He closed his eyes as he fought to catch his breath. Taking gulps of air, he looked down at the planet they were orbiting, as blood rushed through his ears, “I. Am. Kylo Ren.” Chapter 6 : BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE She could feel the ship descending as she quickly cuffed the doctor’s hands behind his back. “Where are you taking me?” he asked. “Somewhere you’ll be useful,” Anna replied quietly. Standing up, she pushed him in front of the ship’s exit, and pressed a hand to her ear, “Rey, open the ramp.” Cold air washed over them as the ramp extended outwards. Slowly the ship touched down and they trudged down the walkway. Captain Ara’ve met them on the landing pad, with an array of guards. With a nod she handed the doctor over to him. The captain turned to her, “We were expecting you two days ago.” Anna shrugged, “You can’t rush perfection,” she joked. The Quarren blinked at her unamused. Shaking her head, she pointed back at the ship, “Hyper drive issues. My apprentice is working on it now.” The alien gave a stiff nod and gestured for her to follow him into the hanger, “I’ll have someone take a look at it. General Organa is eager to speak with you.” As they walked through the base Anna questioned the captain, “Any news of the First Order’s fleet?” “No, they’ve been silent,” he turned and glanced at her, “Too silent.” Anna grit her teeth. “No retaliation?” That doesn’t make sense. We blew that base to smithereens. Holding the door open, Ara’ve shook his head, “Nothing yet.” Anna entered the command center, the room busy as usual, and quickly walked over to the map table. Ara’ve cleared his throat, and Leia lifted up her head, her eyes scanning over the girl. “Thank you, Captain,” she said. With a salute Ara’ve walked away. She looked over at Anna, “We were expecting you two days ago,” she said and Anna nodded her head, as she clasped her hands behind her back. “We had an issue with our hyper drive. Rey is attending to it now.” Leia quirked her eyebrows, “Motivator?” she asked. Anna shrugged, “I try to stay as far away from expensive machinery as possible.” Leia motioned to the door, “Walk with me.” Silently they walked into the hallway. “Doctor Carassi should provide us with a substantial amount of information on the First Order’s plans.” Anna cleared her throat, “What will you do with him?” Leia shrugged, “We don’t torture our prisoners, if that’s what you are asking.” When they reached the end, they turned and entered the General’s quarters. Closing the door, Leia walked over to the window, leaving Anna to stand behind her. The knight fidgeted waiting for the woman to speak. Leia sighed, “You’ve been on your own for quite a while, Anna,” looking down she shook her head, “And it’s been a while since you have worked within an organization. I understand all of that.” Turning around she gave the girl a grave look, “But you have to keep in contact with us.” Anna was silent. Leia took a step forward, “Two days past your planned return—we thought you were dead. All of you.” “I understand, General.” “I don’t want you to think that I am angry with you---.” Anna lifted her chin, “You’re thinking of Ben.” Leia grimaced at the sound of his name. Anna continued, “I understand, I remind you of him, how he was before…but,” Anna looked down, “You shouldn’t feel as though you have to walk on shards of glass around me.” “That’s what you think?” “Yes,” Anna looked up at her, “I’m not as fragile as people think. I will stop him. I know what I have to do, though you and Master Skywalker seem keen on telling me otherwise.” Anna grit her teeth as she moved to the window. Leia sat down and sighed, “I wish it was anyone else but you---.” “So you knew,” Anna said quietly. “That you were in love with my son? I knew the first time he mentioned your name. I knew the moment you ran into that med-center, and when you stayed by him until you passed out.” Anna was silent, her hands clenching into fists. “I’m just sorry I didn’t get to see you two together before he left.” “He didn’t leave,” Anna hissed as she turned around, “You say it like he---,” she broke off and shook her head, avoiding Leia’s gaze. Leia shook her head, “It’s late. Why don’t you get some sleep?” Walking over to the table she tapped on the console. An automated voice came over the speakers, “Yes General?” “Send an ensign to my quarters please, C-3PO.” Straightening her back she looked over at Anna, who had turned back to the window, having crossed her arms. Leia sighed, “You’re right. Ben didn’t just leave. I say it like that because--- I don’t want to remember him like that, Anna. I don’t want to think about Han…” she trailed off, and took a deep breath, “When I think of my son, I want to think of the small moments, when he was happy, when he was safe…” with a sigh she rested a hand on Anna’s shoulder, “He may not remember it, but the three of us were happy. Sending him to Luke, was… one of the worst days of my life, and I have seen many. Too many.” She turned Anna towards her and spoke softly, “But he met you, and you can’t tell me that he doesn’t remember the memories you two have together.” Anna cut her eyes over at the woman, You didn’t see him try to cut my head off. Looking down she laid a hand on top of Leia’s, “I’m not sure memories are of much help to me now.” Before Leia could say anything else, there was a knock at the door, “Come in,” she called, patting Anna on the back. A young woman walked in and gave a salute. The general spoke quickly, “Please show the Commander to her quarters.” “Yes, ma’am,” the ensign replied as she stepped outside. Anna started to follow, but not before Leia grabbed her by the wrist, “I’m proud of you, Anna.” The young Jedi turned around, “No one will say that nearly as much as you deserve, but you should know, how strong, kind, and brave I know you are. Luke saw it, I see it, and Ben saw it too.” Anna’s breath caught in her throat, and her eyes began to sting. Leia let her go and went over to the table, clearing her throat, “Now, go get some rest, tomorrow is going to be just as busy as any other day around here.” Anna hesitated and Leia looked glanced over at her, “Go on,” she said. Anna walked to the door and came to a stop. Turning around she breathed out her next to words, “Thank you.” Leia whispered, as the girl left the room, “Anytime.” **************************************************** ALL PERSONELL ATTEND YOUR STATIONS Anna sat up and glanced at her clock. Just after midnight. Throwing back the course covers she swung her legs off the bed and stood up. BOOM! Her legs wobbled as the ground shook beneath her feet. Alarms began blaring. Running over to her locker she pulled on her robes and boots. She started back over to her bedside, when she stopped and went back to the wardrobe. Grabbing her scarf she wrapped it around her neck. Finding her weapon, she stuck her head out the door, as she buckled the last of her belts. A soldier ran by and she yelled out to him, “Sergeant what’s going on?” The man turned around as he ran down the hall, “The First Order found us.” Anna breathed through clenched teeth, and she started for the command center. She turned the corner, as the ground shook again. Looking up at the ceiling she jumped back as metal screeched and tore, falling down in front of her. The hall was filled with dust and smoke. Covering her mouth with her scarf she stood up. The sound of static echoed through the fall. “This is General Organa, has anyone seen Kuro?” Anna searched the ground, before she found a body buried beneath the metal. A bloody hand reached out from the rubble, a walkie talkie in its palm. Steeling herself, she took the radio, and wiped the blood off before speaking into it, “This is Commander Kuro.” “Thank God. We’ve lost contact with the southern half of the base. Where are you?” Anna paused, “In the southern half of the base,” she said. “Shit,” Leia’s voice carried through the radio, “You’ll have to work your way around.” “Is Rey with you?” Anna asked. “She’s right here.” Rey’s voice came over the speaker, “Anna?” “Rey, listen to me, get the General to the Falcon,” Anna ordered. “What about you?” Anna sighed, as she started back down the hallway, “I’ll meet up with you later, just get her out of here.” The radio was silent for a moment. “Rey?” Anna asked. “I understand.” “Good, just stay calm. Remember your training,” Anna took off in a jog as the tunnel shook again, “And try not to get yourself killed.” ****************************************************** “And try not to---,” Anna’s voice cut out, as they listened. “The signal cut out,” Finn said, as he looked to Rey. Nodding her head, the young girl turned to the General, “You heard her, we need to get out of here.” Leia shook her head, “I’m not going anywhere---.” Boom!! Sparks rained down from the ceiling as the tie fighters made another bombing run. Grabbing the Resistance leader’s hand, Rey pulled her towards the door. “We need to leave now.” Finn, Rey, and Leia, ran down the hall. Running behind them Leia yelled over her shoulder, “Someone find Doctor Carassi, then get yourselves to the transports.” Rey pulled the woman down the hall. Finn grabbed a blaster from a fallen trooper, and covered them. “Over there!” Blaster fire speeded towards them, and Rey moved to the back of the group, deflecting the shots. Once they were all over the threshold, she forced the doors closed. Everyone ran. They turned left, then right, making their way to the hanger. The ground shook as a sound roared above them. Leia leaned against the wall, as the tremors passed. Pressing a hand to her chest she looked back at the breathlessly, “God, I’m getting sick of this.” Helping her to stand, Rey prodded them forward, “Come on.” Pushing forward, they finally made it to the hanger. “There!” Finn yelled pointing to their ship. Rey breathed a sigh of relief as they ran towards it. VMMMMMMM. They froze as a hooded figure blocked their path, a red lightsaber scarring the ground in front of them. The black hood fell back to reveal a pale face, with red eyes, and a jagged scar running from the center of his brow, to the left side of his jaw. Leia breathed, her voice filled with agony, “Ben.” His eyes glanced over the group, before falling on Rey, “Give her to me,” he said pointing to the General. Rey ignited her lightsaber and moved in front of Leia, “Fuck off.” The dark Jedi narrowed his eyes, and raised his own weapon, “You will not beat me this time, girl. I am stronger than before, a worthy successor to Lord Vader’s mantle.” Rey prepared to strike, when a voice echoed through the hanger, “Ben!” Everyone looked to the right. Her saber behind her back, Anna held her palm out, and a low hum resonated through the air. Before he could react, Kylo Ren was thrown back. Rey stared at her mentor, who met her gaze. Shaking her head she pointed at the ship and yelled at the top of her voice, “Run!” Finn grabbed Leia’s arm and they ran up the ramp, Rey following behind them. A ferocious yell sounded behind her and she turned just in time to see, Anna meet Ren’s attack. The Jedi knight glanced over at her, as she forced him back. Raising her leg she kicked him in the middle of his chest, “GO REY!” The girl ran into the ship. Anna turned back to face the man. He panted and paced in front of her. Without hesitation she advanced, jumping into the air. Their swords locked and he pushed her back, “You’re weak,” he hissed. With a yell, he threw his hand forward, tendrils of lightening racing towards her. “Your lover is gone. He was weak. You made him weak.” Holding up her sword, she focused on him through the force, struggling beneath the full weight of his fury. When he stopped, her knees buckled and she stumbled to the side. Wind raced through her hair as the Millennium Falcon powered up. Pushing herself up, she blocked his next attack, as she tried to gulp in some much needed air. They broke apart, and he spun around, pulling on her sword through the force. Ripped from her grasp it fell to the ground in front of his feet. Exhausted, Anna fell to the ground. On her hands and knees she gasped for air. Heavy black boots stepped in front of her. She looked up. Dark hair framed his face as he bent down, and taking one hand off the hilt of his sword he closed his fingers around her throat. Her airway constricted, and she struggled to breath as he forced her to stand. She threw her fists against his chest, tears running down her face as her toes grazed the ground. Her eyes looked over his head, Rey’s face staring at her through the Falcon’s cockpit. Run, Rey, run. Kylo Ren forced her to look down at him, “You failed,” he snarled. Anna pried at his fingers, as her vision began to fill with darkness, “B-e—n,” she whispered. The Falcon’s engine roared, as the ship took off. Ren turned around, a yelled, his hand releasing her. Falling to the ground she let out a gasp as her lungs filled with air. She looked over at Ben. “No!” he yelled. He ignited his sword, and threw his hands up into the air. Anna groaned at the sheer force of his power that echoed through the force. Rising up, the ships engines fired, but floated in mid-air. Kylo Ren let out a scream, as the ship finally slipped from his grasp. Anna looked at the ground next to him, and focused on her lightsaber. Holding out her hand she started to pull it towards her. Biting the inside of her cheek, she threw all of her energy into the pull, and the lightsaber flew towards her. Boom! A bright flash of light exploded in front of her and she covered her eyes. Once the light was gone she looked at the ground her weapon in a million incinerated pieces. A heavy boot, landed in her side, and she screamed at the feeling of ribs cracking under the pressure. Rolling onto her back she looked up, to find red eyes looking down on her. She wheezed, as her vision flickered. She wrapped a hand around his leg, before passing out, “Kill me.” Strong arms propped her up, and she felt as she was floating. A familiar voice echoed through her mind, “Even you may still prove to be useful.” Then she knew no more. Chapter 7 : BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Anna hurt everywhere. Her side screamed as she tried to take in a deep breath, and her eyes burned, blinded by the bright light above her. She shivered as she looked down, her shirt was gone, her torso bound by tight bandages. A cold sweat ran down her back as she tried to move, only to find that her hands were held down by heavy metal shackles. Whoosh. The sound of a door opening made her jump. She tried to turn her head, but to no avail, her vision was blocked out by the metal structure that was holding her. A voice spoke softly behind her, and she squinted trying to see through the bright lights above her, “You’re awake.” Her heart jumped at the voice. She closed her eyes, as a wave of nausea washed over her, “Ben---.” “That is not my name,” he growled out as he moved to stand in front of her. She let out a yelp, as he forced her head back. Anna closed her eyes and fought to stay conscious. Leather wrapped fingers grazed the side of her face, and she opened her eyes. She had not gotten a good look at him before. The scar was new, but so were the dark circles beneath his eyes, and the way his eyes drooped as he stared at her. He was exhausted and battered, from the way he favored his right leg, to his busted lip, and the arm he wrapped around his side. Looking at him now, after all these years, she could not help the little spark of pity that settled in the center of her chest. Anna gasped as his power subsided, and her head fell forward. A hand grabbed her by the hair, and forced her to look up. “Don’t you dare,” he said with a sneer. She narrowed hers eyes at him, “What?” she asked defiantly. “I don’t need your pity. I am stronger now than I have ever been.” She pulled her head away from him, “Really? Because I only see a sad man, writhing in his own ruin. You think you’re strong? You are weaker now then you have ever been.” SMACK! Anna gasped as he thrust his hand at her, forcing her body to go rigid against the metal plating that encased her. “I’m not the one laying here helpless, now, am I?” he asked. She spoke through clenched teeth, “I am not helpless.” Another wave of nausea rolled through her stomach. Kylo stepped closer, pressing his lips to her ear, and chuckled, “We both know the truth. It’s written all over you. The angst, the sorrow. You’re so eager to please, but terrified of failure. It’s all on your hands. You failed us all: Luke, Leia, Rey, and m---,” he broke off and stepped back biting his lip, “And Ben.” Anna closed her eyes, as he stared at her. A pressure built up behind her eyes, and she began to pant. “Let me go,” she whispered. Her blue eyes glanced up at him, pleading. Ren rolled his eyes and pressed her head against the table with his power, “Oh, we’re just getting---!” Anna heaved, her face turning red from the strain. Veins popped up underneath her skin while she coughed. Bile poured from her mouth as her body jerked. Ren took a step back, letting his hand fall to the side. His power subsided, and Anna leaned up and to the side, as she continued to heave. She looked up at him, when it was over, through hazy eyes. Her vomit was everywhere, and she laid back down, unable to wipe her mouth, because of the shackles. Closing her eyes, she passed out. Ren looked down on her, before walking to the door silently. Stepping out into the hallway a trooper saluted him. He turned back to the room, “Have someone clean this up.” “Yes, sir.” He started walking down the hall before turning around, “Bring her to my quarters once she’s ready.” Pulling up his hood he marched down the hallway. Notes: Super short chapter, but I have a good excuse. We're going to see Star Wars for the third time (I think we may be addicted). Have a nice night! Chapter 8 : BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Kylo Ren stood by the doorway, pulling off his gloves, as they dragged the Jedi into his quarters. She was still unconscious, her head falling to the side, as the two Stormtroopers held her up. Her feet dragged behind her as they walked. “Put her on the bed,” he ordered. The soldiers glanced at one another in hesitation. Her clothes were filthy, stained with blood, sweat, and vomit. Ren slammed his fist against the wall, “NOW,” he barked. “Yes, sir,” they both answered. None too gently, they laid her on the bed, and stepped back, awaiting further orders. Ren moved next to the bed, turning his back on them as he stared down at her. “Leave us,” he said quietly, over his shoulder. Clicking their heels, the two Stormtroopers ran from the room. Bending down he ran his fingers over her cheek. She was warm to the touch, almost too warm. The girl stirred, giving a soft moan as she turned her face away from him. He tries to press into her mind, but a firm wall meets him. Even unconscious, she was still impervious to such an attack. Looking down, he hooked his fingers around the waist of her pants, and pulled down the ripped garments, until her legs were bare. Taking a knife from the bed stand he cut away the bandages that wrapped around her torso. Her left side was marred by a large blue and purple bruise. He looked up at her face as he turned her so he could pull the bandages out from underneath her body. The tips of his fingers skimmed over her smooth skin for a moment, before he pulled away. He threw the festering garments at the door, and walked over to his locker. Silently, he returned to the bed, with one of his robes and a vial of golden liquid in hand. Setting it to the side, he moved until he was directly over her, sliding one hand around the nape of her neck, the other wrapping around to rest on her lower back. With a grunt he pulled on her until she was sitting up, her head hanging back. Grabbing the robe, he quickly put one arm through, before reaching for her left arm. A groan, echoed through the room and he looked up, blue eyes staring at him from beneath black lashes. “Ben?” Anna whispered, fingers tracing the scar on his face. He froze. A small smile graced her lips, before she went limp once more, a weak sigh slipping over her lips. Pulling the robe closed Ren laid her back down on the bed. Her brown hair cascaded over her shoulders. Uncorking the vial he forced the liquid down her throat. She did not fight back. Looking down he laid a blanket over her before he sat down on the edge of the bed, setting the vial on the table, with his back turned towards her. He ran a hand down his face, and sighed, as he bowed his head. He glanced over his shoulder at her, and shook his head. She’s laying on her stomach. Her face is pressed into the pillow, with one hand laying, heavy, on his chest, and her foot hangs off the edge of the bed. He runs his fingers over her naked skin, trailing them up and down her spine. Kylo shook his head, and stood up from the bed, “You should have stayed away.” He walked to the door, not knowing if he was saying that to the girl passed out in his bed, or to himself. ******************************************* Hux was an arrogant man, and the only thing keeping Ren from killing him, was his usefulness. Walking onto the Bridge, the General glanced over at him snidely, “I see you’ve taken a liking to the Jedi.” “You have more pressing matters to attend to, General,” Ren replied, as he crossed his arms. Hux was not about to let this go though, “Your failure to defeat Skywalker was understandable, but this woman? Perhaps the master of the Knights of Ren is not as powerful as we once thought.” Ren turned around, “Did you recover the asset?” “My men found Doctor Carassi immediately. It is fortunate that we tagged him, not only did he lead us to the Resistance, but he found you a new pet.” Ren grit his teeth, and Hux raised an eyebrow. Sometimes it was too easy to get under the dark Jedi’s skin. “She will tell us the location of the remaining rebels. Until then, try to contain yourself Hux.” Kylo spun on his heel and walked off of the Bridge. “And when she tries to escape?” Hux called after him, “Your quarters are hardly secure.” Ren froze. Clenching his fists he spoke over his shoulder, “She won’t leave. Not this time.” ***************************************** He focused on the door, and the room beyond it as he walked down the door. A small light bloomed in the Force, familiar but changed. Good, she’s still here. He glanced at the guard, “Status?” “No activity, sir.” “You may leave.” “Sir,” the Stormtrooper raised his hand in salute before walking down the hall. Ren faced the doors. Waving his hand, the door slid open. No light exited the room as he stepped over the threshold. Walking through the darkness, he stepped over to the counter, and flipped a light on. He glanced over at the bed, to find it empty. Stepping into the center of the room, he spoke softly, “I know you’re here,” he said. A gasp sounded behind him, and he raised his hands just in time to grab Anna’s wrists, stopping the knife she held from piercing his skin. Sweat ran down her face, and she grit her teeth. Ren increased his hold, and she let go of the knife with a cry. It clattered to the floor, and she grabbed him by his collar weakly as her legs gave out. She slid to the floor, pulling him along. “It’s gone—it’s gone, where is it?” she sobbed. Her fists beat against his chest as she looked up at him, “What did you do to me?” she whispered. Anna’s eyes were frenzied and crazed as she glared at him. Her breath came out in pants, and where his hands met her skin, she writhed as though she was on fire. Silently he looked to the table, at the empty vial lying on its side, “An invention of Doctor Carassi,” he said looking down at her, “It temporarily cuts you off from the Force: it blinds you, makes you no better than a common human.” Anna whimpered as she swallowed, “Is this what they did to you?” she asked. Ren looked down, and pushed her away, “No.” Standing up he walked to the door, leaving her helpless on the cold floor, “Go to sleep. I’ll have some water brought by later.” ******************************************* Two analysts were on the observation deck before him, but not for long. The second he stepped foot in the room, they looked at each other and all but ran from the room. Ren walked over to the window, and looked down on the moon they were orbiting. “You will break.” He looks up through swollen eyes at the wires cutting into his hands. It burns. Blood runs down his arms. “Anna, stop,” he whispers. It is the first time he has spoken in days, and he is begging her to stop, but he knows it is not her. He struggles to remember that. He focuses on the differences. They are the only way he stays sane. It is the way her eyes are the wrong shade of blue, the slimy feeling he has every time she touches him. Her smile is different too, it is too big, and too cold. She laughs at him as she struts around him in a circle, “Anna, stooooop,” she mocks. She comes to a stop in front of him, grabbing him by the chin, “Your attachment to her will be your undoing little Solo.” She pushes away from him, making him swing in the air. His stomach rolls with nausea. Stepping back, she pulls her hair up, exposing her neck, sliding her fingers down her throat, “Do you think she’ll scream?” she asks, looking at him through hooded eyes, “This girl--- we’ll find her next, with or without your help. The rest of the Knights will want to kill all of the Jedi, but her? I think we’ll keep her alive.” Ben grit his teeth and jerked. “Oh? I think I finally touched a nerve.” She smiled wickedly, “I can see it now.” Letting her hands fall to her sides, she walked around him and stopped. Tilting her head back she let out a scream, “NO, STOP. BEN HELP ME!” Her screams turned to laughter and she grabbed hold of him, wrapping her arms around his waist. She stuck her head beneath him, and grinned up at him, “What do you think?” Giggling to herself she moved to face him, her arms still locked around him. “Pretty close, or should I add more terror?” His body jerked as the wires bit into his wrists from the added weight. She pouted, “Oh Benny, don’t worry. Kaana will take real good care of your girl,” she smirked as she refered to herself “Shut up,” he hissed, his hands balling up into fists. The impersonator quirked an eyebrow at him, “Is that any way to talk to a lady---?” “Shut up!” he yelled, letting out a blast of energy. His captor flew back from him, slamming against the wall with a heavy thud. Standing up she, held a lightsaber, the red light blinding him, ready to cut him down. Weak from exhaustion his head hung as his eyes closed. Breathing heavily Kaana deactivated her weapon and walked over to a console. The sound of typing filled his ears as she plugged in her code. “I was wanting to wait to use this until it was a little more refined,” she panted, “No human has survived the drug’s effects yet.” Glancing over at him she pushed her hair out of her face, “Maybe you’ll be different. If not, I can always find your little friend and try it on her,” lifting her hand Kaana took a deep breath before slamming her hand down on the console, “See you on the other side, Solo.” Air hisses behind him, as a door screeches open. A hum fills the air, getting louder the closer it gets. Hovering, a droid moves in front of him, before moving towards his neck with a syringe pointed at him, filled with a dark liquid. He flinches and lets out a gasp as the needle pierces his skin. Blood begins to pound in his ears. He looks up, light blinding his eyes. His skin burns and he lets out a scream. At least he thinks he does, but he can’t hear anything. He can’t move as his body goes rigid, fighting and struggling against each wave of pain the washes over him. Then, it stops. Everything blurs together, a roar of a thousand voices rings in his ears. “Ben?” a voice calls out to him. He looks up and there she is, standing in front of him, and he knows: it’s really her. From her hair to her eyes, to the way she stares down at him, “Anna,” he breathes. She doesn’t hear him. Her hair shines as she turns her back on him. He gasps, and tries to call on a power that has been with him for years. He jerks in the air, as pain rushes through him. It’s gone. Everything is gone. ************************************************** “He’s broken. Scale back the dosage, wean him off of it,” three voices whispered around him. __________________________ “You have done your work well, Kaana Ren. He is ready to begin his training. Bring him to me.” ___________________________ A woman’s voice answers, “As you wish Supreme Leader.” __________________________ “Follow the footsteps of your Grandfather. Then, we will rule the Galaxy.” __________________________ “The time of the Sith, has returned.” *************************************************** “This shall be your test, the first of many.” He stared across the battlefield. Smoke cut through his vision. “Kill her.” Kaana stood across from him, wearing a familiar face. Brown hair fluttered in the hot wind. He grit his teeth together, and advanced. VMMMMM. The sound of two lightsabers activating echoed off the canyon walls. With a yell, he swung at her, moving past her as she tucked and rolled on the ground. Standing up, she let out a grunt, stabbing at his back. He whipped around, deflecting the attack. Both adversaries raised their hands, held their hands up, digging their feet into the ground as a low hum thrummed through the force. He glared at her, seething. She smirked as he was pushed back slightly, “Is it the face? I thought you’d be used to it by now.” The young man, lowered his head and yelled, pushing himself forward with one step, then two. BOOM! Kaana let out a yell as she was shoved back. Rolling over she avoided a swipe of his saber. Standing up, she blocked his strike just in time, the two of them locked together. Their sabers pressed together. Turning forward, he forced his cross guard into her shoulder. Kaana let out a scream. That was all he needed. Jumping to the side he swung around, forcing her to her knees. Her sword arm weakened she was too slow to block his attacks. Rearing back, he came down upon her, slicing through her body, cutting her arm off from the shoulder. Kaana Ren fell to her knees, screaming. He paced in front of her panting. A dark figure walked towards them through the smoke. “Finish it,” a voice whispered in his mind. He looked down at the woman on the ground. Even through the pain, she was still focused enough to hold Anna’s visage, but not consistently. As he stared down at her, she flashed between people. Anna and a woman, scars running across her skin. Open sores marring her face. Placing both hands on the hilt of his sword he held the saber over his head. With a ferocious yell he brought the sword down on her, slicing he body into two pieces. Pulling back he sliced through her again, and again, hacking at the dead body. His shoulder rising and falling from his breathlessness, he looked up. The dark figure stood closer now. Deactivating his weapon he limped over, kneeling on the ground. “The Knights of Ren, are without a leader. Kaana Ren had outlasted her usefulness. But you, my apprentice,” the power of the force wrapped around his body, forcing him to look up, “You shall take her place. Who are you?” He was silent for a moment. Pressing his fist into the ground he, looked up in determination, “I am Kylo Ren.” His master turned away, “Good, good.” Together they walked through the canyon. Snoke turned to him, “You have proven quite competent in your training.” “Your training guides me, Master,” Ren said, inclining his head. The Sith lord turned to him, “Slaughtering Kaana Ren was easy. Your next test will be more difficult.” They came to a stop. A light from a shuttle shown down upon them, “Return to the Jedi. Destroy them.” Notes: Comments and Kudos are always welcome. Hey! If you have some time on your hands, let me know what you think of the story so far. It's a little daunting without some real feedback on the plot and characters, and I really like hearing from you guys! Have a nice night and I'll *see* you tomorrow! Chapter 9 : BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Anna was curled up on the edge of the bed, a thin blanket wrapped around her body. Ren walked over and sat on the bed, “Wake up,” he said in a low voice. The girl didn’t move. Reaching over, he pulled the blanket off of her. She groaned and reached for the covers, her legs exposed to the cool air, “Wake. Up,” he repeated. Slowly, Anna opened her eyes and looked up at him. Shivering, she rubbed her arms as she sat up. She narrowed her eyes, and scooted away from him. Ren rolled his eyes, and held out his hand, “Here,” he said gruffly. She glanced at him warily. Gritting his teeth, he opened his hand, a vial of gold liquid in his palm, “Take it. Now.” “No.” The dark Jedi raised his hand in a blur, and Anna’s head collided with the wall behind her with a whack, “Either take it quietly, or I’ll force it down your throat,” he hissed. She shook her head slightly. Anna stared at him wide eyed as he uncapped the bottle, and gripped her by the chin. Holding one hand over her nose, he tilted her head back, and forced the contents into her mouth. Once the vial was empty, he clamped his hand over her mouth, “Swallow,” he ordered. Anna struggled, trying to kick out at him but his power was too strong. Tears ran from her eyes, as she stared straight at him, trying to breathe. With nothing left to do, she swallowed the disgusting liquid. Ren let her go, and she bent over the side of the bed gagging, “It tastes like Anooba piss,” she hissed. Wiping her mouth she looked up to see him leaving. Standing up she grabbed him by the wrist, “Ben, wait.” He was silent. She raised her eyebrows, No, “I am Kylo Ren,” bull today? Her eyebrows scrunched together as she instinctively searched for him in the Force. Then, she remembered. It was gone. His hand tightened in hers, “My name is---.” Anna sighed, “Kylo Ren. Yeah, you’ve said that a few million times.” Grabbing him by the shoulders she forced him to turn around and face her, “Why are you doing this?” she asked, motioning to the bedroom. It was a far cry from the torture chamber she had expected. It was his turn to raise an eyebrow, “Would you have preferred the interrogation room?” “No, but does that mean I shouldn’t have expected it?” she asked, with a shrug. Twisting out of her grasp he stepped towards the door, “You will remain here, where I can keep an eye on you. Too many people have escaped under Hux’s watch.” “People escape frequently on this ship?” she said cocking her head to the side. Ren shrugged, “Try it. You won’t get farther than the door.” “I don’t need the force to fight,” she said. “No you don’t. What you do need, though, are the passcodes, retina scans, and several other forms of identification to get off of this level.” She immediately thought of Rey and the Resistance. Ren narrowed his eyes, knowing instantly what she was thinking, without having to look into her mind, “Maybe they’ll come for you,” he said in a mocking tone. Anna shook her head even if they wanted to, they had no idea where the First Order even was at the moment, “No, they won’t,” she said as she narrowed her eyes, “But you can’t just lock me up in here, Ben.” Turning around he opened the door, “But I can try,” he said walking away. As the doors closed Anna stood stock still. He let me call him, Ben. *************************************************** The only person that Anna had seen after Ben left was the trooper in charge of bringing her food, water, and more of those disgusting vials. She had tried several different tricks to avoid taking the drug, but they caught her every time, and every time she cursed herself. Having such an innate ability stripped away from her had been disconcerting, but she was growing used to it. Her body felt more stable, her legs didn’t feel as though they were about to pop off and walk around without her anymore, but still… She felt empty. Like she was naked an exposed. The lights were dimmer, sounds were harder to pick up on and every time the guard came to the door, she almost screamed. She needed to find a way to circumvent the drug’s effects. On the second day, they took her to the shower room, and she wanted to thank whoever had allowed it. She stretched under the cool water, as she washed away all the grime and sweat from her body. It was amazing how two days of doing nothing could make a person smell so…ripe. “Come on, hurry up,” a voice called from the door. Turning around, she crouched down covering herself from her handler’s gaze. A slimy feeling sunk over her as she watched him run his eyes over her body. Even behind that helmet, she could tell he was enjoying himself. He laughed at her, “Move along, it’s not like you’ve got something I’ve never seen before.” She glared at him. “I’ll be out in a moment,” she said, her voice hoarse from a day of yelling at the guards camped outside Ren’s quarters. With a shrug, the trooper left the room. Anna stood with her arms still wrapped around herself. Ten minutes later, she shut off the water and patted her hair with a towel, before stepping over to the counter. A sigh of relief escaped her at the welcoming sight of fresh undergarments and another robe. She quickly pulled the clothes on before walking to the door. The trooper from before was standing at attention on the other side of the hall. He walked over to her, grabbed her by the arm and forced her down the hall. She pushed him away, “I can walk on my own, thank you very much.” Turning around she walked towards the room, retracing her steps. Eyes bored into her back, and she glanced over her shoulder, only to find a white helmet staring back at her. A sickening feeling settled in her gut. When they reached the door, he pressed his hand against the console, and opened the doors. Anna started to go inside, when a hand grabbed her by the back of her neck and forced her inside. She let out a yell, and reached back, only to have her arm twisted behind her back. “Shut up,” he hissed in her ear. With a grunt he pushed her onto the bed, before turning back to close the door. Once the exit was blocked he turned back around, “Oh, we’re gonna have some fun sweetheart, and then? We’re gonna settle down and talk for a while. You’ve got some secrets the higher-ups want, real bad.” Anna bent her knees and readied to defend herself. The man lunged at her, and with a yell, she jumped up into the air, wrapped her legs around his neck, and forced him to the ground. Spluttering, he hit her legs with his hands, and she squeezed her thighs. Then, she let him go. Standing up, she walked over to the table, and watched as the trooper rose from the floor, “Get out,” she said, as she poured herself a glass of water. Holding his side, the trooper limped out of the room, slamming the door closed behind him. ************************************************* Kylo Ren had known since the moment he had met the insufferable man: General Hux was in love with the sound of his own voice. “Lord Ren has failed to gain any information from the Jedi. He circumvents your will, Supreme Leader. His obvious attachment to the girl is---.” The Supreme leader waved his hand above them, “Leave us,” he commanded, his voice resonating throughout the room. Hux turned around, and Kylo looked at him, catching the man’s obvious glare. Once he was gone, he looked up at the hologram, “I sense your indecision. This girl has made you lose your balance.” Ren bowed his head, “Forgive me.” The Supreme Leader leaned down and studied him, “You care for her,” he said. Ren grit his teeth, “You were to destroy her as you did the Jedi Order. Did you think you could hide such an obvious failure?” Snoke roared. “She was a mistake,” Ren hissed, “She means nothing to me.” “Yet she STILL LIVES ,” the Sith Lord slammed his fist down on his throne. He moved, and the hologram flickered, exposing his decaying flesh. “Perhaps your weakness still exists within you, Lord Ren. Perhaps you need a review of your training.” Ren watched as he leaned back, feeling his master’s fury through the Force, “Bring me the information,” he hissed. As his visage disappeared, his last command echoed through the chamber, “Or bring me her head.” Notes: Short chapter--- I'm tired and I keep saying Rylo Ken. I think that means it's time to go to bed. Have a nice night. I will put the final touches on the second chapter and post around noon tomorrow! Kudos and comments are my sustenance -figuratively. Chapter 10 : BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE Kylo Ren marched down the hall, the sound of his heavy footsteps ringing out behind him. Supreme Leader Snoke’s voice barraged his mind. “Bring me the information, or bring me her head. Choose. Are you Kylo Ren, or Ben Solo?” Turning the corner, he saw the guard at his door straighten up. It had been a week since he’d come back to his quarters. Silently he stalked towards the man. “Any activity---?” he asked before he was pulled into the man’s mind. “He’s weak. Find the girl, take the coordinates from her. Other than that I don’t care what you do to her.” “Yes, General.” _______________________________________ The sound of water hitting the tiles echoes throughout the room. She’s standing underneath the water, clear rivulets running over her suntanned skin, her hands tangling in her hair. Soap glistens on her breasts, and she tilts her head back, letting the water run down her face. “Come on, hurry up.” She turns around in surprise, wrapping her arms around her body, and she crouches down trying to hide herself. “Move along, it’s not like you’ve got something I’ve never seen before.” _______________________________________ “Oh, we’re gonna have some fun sweetheart, and then? We’re gonna settle down and talk for a while. You’ve got some secrets the higher-ups want, real bad.” _______________________________________ Ren turned around and looked at the trooper, fury building in his gut as he listened to his thoughts. The trooper backed away from him warily, “Uh, Sir?” ************************************************* Anna was laying on the bed when it happened. A ferocious, terrified scream broke through the door. She sat up. Another scream broke out, and she ran to the door. VMMMMM. The sound of lightsaber activating made her jump and she started slamming her fists on the door, “Ben, don’t,” she yelled. The screams cut off. Gasping for breath she took a step back. She couldn’t feel anything. There was no sign of lige or death, only silence, and she found it maddening. Was the man dead? Blast it, she thought as her hands began to shake. A beeping noise came through the door before it slid open. Standing at the threshold, Ben stood facing her, panting, the red glow of his saber glinting against his scar. Behind him she could see the trooper of the ground, red blood running down from where his fingers used to be. The body moved, and she looked back at Ben. Behind him the trooper stood, and made his way down the hallway. Silently, Ben took a step towards her, and she took a step back, raising one arm in front of her. He stopped. “Are you afraid of me?” he asked. She stared at him blue eyes clashing with the red glow of his sword, “Yes.” Looking down, he flicked his wrist and deactivated his saber. Black hair framed his face as he looked back up at her, “Good.” Turning away he stalked over to the console. A man, she had never seen before came on screen. He turned to face the screen, “Ah, Lord Ren---.” Ben cut him off, “I will be having my personal guard attend to this level as of now, General Hux. Your men seem…” He looked over his shoulder at Anna, “Incompetent. They couldn’t even handle a weakened Jedi.” The men behind Hux looked around, before looking down to avoid his glare, “My men are---.” “It is being attended to, General.” With that final statement, he cut off the transmission. Anna stared at his back, “Ben, what was that---?” “Why do you keep calling me that?” he asked over his shoulder. “Because that’s who you are,” she answered, “At least to me. And Luke---and your parents.” He turned around, “My father called me by that name, before I killed him. Did you know that?” Anna looked away, “Yes.” “Would the real Ben do that? “I think a lost Ben would.” They stood in silence for a few moments. Ben crossed his arms and looked at her for a moment. She met his gaze and held it. Ben cleared his throat and looked away, “I need the coordinates to the Resistance base.” Anna shrugged, “I don’t know where they are.” He looked back at her and she shook her head, “I was literally there only two days. One of those days doesn’t count because someone decided to bomb the shit out of them.” “Anna.” “Huh.” “What?” Anna cocked her head at him, “That’s the first time you’ve called me by name in five years.” He walked over until he was right in front of her, staring down at her. She looked down, their faces separated by mere inches of space. “Don’t change the subject.” Small hands pressed against his chest, pushing him back. Anna shook her head, her face serious, “Then stop trying to manipulate me with this crap, Kylo Ren.” He stared at her in surprise, and she frowned, “I’m not the young teenager I once was, you’re going to have to try harder than this.” Turning around she began to move away, but he caught her by the wrist, “Let go of me,” she hissed. Raising her hand she swung at him, but he blocked he and pressed her up against the wall. “Why did you let the guard go? You had him subdued, it would have been easy enough to get down to the hanger.” She remained silent. He looked at her in amazement, “You want to be here.” It wasn’t a question. “’Want’ is strong word, Ben,” she said looking up into his eyes. Gritting her teeth she tore from his grasp and then walked over to the table. Reaching down Anna took another golden vial. Pulling out the cork, she tipped her head back and drained the contents. She grimaced and shook her head at the foul taste. Looking back over at him she shrugged, “We’re not finished yet.” Chapter 11 : BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “We’re not finished yet,” Anna said staring at him. Ben stood speechless, her stark blue eyes boring into his. Holding her breath, she took a step towards him, only to watch him take a step back. She cocked her head at him, “Are you afraid?” “No.” Anna tilted her head, at his hurried tone, and the way he looked away from her. It was then that she realized something. They were both afraid, but she faced her fear, and he buried his. Ben shifted from one foot to the other, as his hands clenched into fists. Without a word or a look he walked past her. Slamming his fist down on the console, he opened the door, and took off down the corridor. The sound of his footsteps chased him as he took off in a sprint. With a gasp he turned to the right, only to find two storm troopers in his way. Clicking their heels they raised their hands in salute, “Lord Ren---.” Flinging his hand up into the air, he threw them against opposite walls of the corridor. With a groan they each slid to the floor unconscious as he ran past them. He was panting when he finally made it to his destination. Coming to a stop he entered his code into the console. Denied. Cursing, he entered the code once more. Sweat dripped down his face, and he grit his teeth together. With a ding the door opened and he ran inside. With a flick of his wrist he turned on the center light, and made his way to the center of the room. His leather gloved hands gripped tightly onto the edge of the table as he gasped for breath, “Please, show me again--- hah , Show me. It’s too close. The pain---.” Hanging his head, he closed his eyes and groaned. “Grandfather, help me, please.” Opening his eyes he stared into the hollow eyes of the Dark Lord’s mask. Straightening his back he held his hand out to it, whispering into the silence, “Help me wipe out the light.” ************************************************************ Anna stood at the door flabbergasted as Ben ran past her. Her eyes burned into his back as he ran down the hall, losing sight of him only when he turned the corner. She looked up in amazement, The door… In his haste, he had neglected to lock her back up. With tentative steps, she lifted her foot over the threshold. A sigh escaped her at the newfound freedom. Looking up, she ran after Ben. Her footsteps echoed behind her, as her bare feet carried her down the long hallway. Skidding to a stop she turned down the way Ben had. She froze. Two Stormtroopers laid on the floor, pushing themselves up slowly. Frazzled they stumbled. Taking a deep breath she ran past them. “Hey you, stop!” Looking behind her she could see them trying to follow her, she saw a trooper reaching out for her, before falling to the ground. Rounding another corner she ran past an open room. Panting she came to a stop and turned, running back to the room. It was dark, except for a single light in the center of the room and a dark haired figure. Catching her breath, she walked inside. The room was full of artifacts, from swords to guns, and from scrolls to ancient holograms. Coming to a stop she stood still. Ben stood hunched over a table, his shoulders shaking. One hand holding onto the table in a death grip, while the other was stretched out over a dark object. Anna took a step forward, “Ben?” He didn’t answer. Warily she walked next to him, and started to reach out for him, when she saw what was laying on the table. With a gasp she wrenched her hand back. Melted, mutilated, and mangled, was a dark mask. Even without Anna’s connection to the Force, a chill ran down her spine as she looked at it. Swallowing her fear, she laid a hand on his shoulder. He jerked away from her, “Don’t touch me,” he hissed. He moved away from her and began to pace erratically. ‘He said it was gone. I did everything, I wiped it out, it’s supposed to be gone…” “Ben.” “”I can’t stop,” he ran his shaking fingers through his hair. “Ben.” Whirling around on her he yelled, “WHAT?” His eyes were crazed as he stared at her. Anna bit her lip and took a step forward, reaching out for him, his eyes following her every move. She moved slowly, until she was right in front of him. Reaching up she let her fingers brush through his hair, before coming to rest on his cheek, “You are afraid.” She peered up at him as tears began to fall down his face, “Snoke lied to you, Ben.” She closed her eyes, and let her hand drift down until it stopped on the center of his chest. Opening her eyes she stepped even closer, their faces just inches away from one another, “He told you that you were weak, that the only place for you was here,” Anna motioned to the table, “He told you the dark side was your only ally. He lied to you, Ben.” Looking down she gave a small smile as she stroked her thumb across his chest, “You know I’m right. You are strong, and kind,” she looked back up at him as he scoffed, “But most importantly,” she whispered as she moved both hands up to his head, forcing him to look down on her, “You’re human. You make mistakes, but you can always come home.” He stared down at her, “I don’t—I can’t---.” “I know you’re still in there, come back to me, Ben. Please.” He shook his head, but she held onto him. Closing her eyes, she let out a deep breath. Slowly, and deliberately she lowered the wall on her mind. With a gasp Ben, felt it crumble and give way, letting him inside. ______________________________________________________ Two students, a boy and a girl, stand facing one another. An instructor yells at them and they each bend their knees and raise their hands. With a yell the boy, with black hair, brown eyes, and freckles, lunges. With a grin the girl drops to the ground missing his strike, and with a grunt she juts out her leg, tangling hers with his. The boy gives a surprised shout as he falls to the ground, a loud thud echoeing throughout the chamber. His breath is forced from his lungs as he crashes to the ground, and he stares up at the ceiling, stunned. Blue eyes appear over him, and a small hand is held out to him. He pushes it away and stands on his own. A hand thwacks him on the back, and she walks away. With a glare he walks back to his corner. The instructor clears his throat, “Again.” ______________________________________________________ “Clear your mind. Focus on the stones,” Master Skywalker’s voice intones. With a deep breath, she closes her eyes, and tries to clear her mind, and focus on the stones. She sits there forever, pins and needles beginning to stick into her legs. The clattering of rocks surprises her and she opens her eyes. Across from her, the boy from before is holding his hand out two stones moving towards him. “Good job, Ben,” says Master Skywalker. Ben’s eyes meet hers and he gives a cheesy grin. Rolling her eyes, she looks away and begins again. ______________________________________________________ Two figures creep down the hall, staying low and near the wall in an effort to avoid the security lights. “Psssssst,” a voice hisses. Turning to the right, they each take off in a run, scaling the wall. Dropping down they each land with a thud, before running towards the forest at full speed. Once they are past the tree line they slow to a walk. Pulling back her hood a young Ann looks at her companion, “What are we doing here?” she asks. Ben pulls back his hood and motions for her to follow him. Gritting her teeth, the duo walks through the forest, until they come to a clearing. Anna stops and crosses her arms. Ben turns around and cocks his head, gesturing for her to follow him. She shakes her head, “No, not until you tell me what we’re doing here.” Ben scowls and sighs shaking his head, “I want you to teach me.” Anna’s eyebrows shoot up in surprise, “What?” “I want you to show me how to fight… I suck.” She’s silent for a moment, before she breaks out in a grin, “Alright. But only if you show me how to move the rocks.” Ben looks at her in surprise, before he mirrors her smile, “Deal.” _______________________________________________________ The forest is silent as he walks, except for the wind rustling through the trees. He swats at a bug flying in front of him, when a shadow falls over his head. “Aaaaaaah!” he looks up just in time to see a dark figure flying towards him. With a grunt a body flies into him and they fall backwards onto the ground. He groans and looks up. “You’re too easy, Ben,” Anna says breathlessly. She’s looking down at him with a grin, her hands closed around his wrists keeping him pinned to the ground. With a grunt he tries to sit up, but she pushes him back down, “You’ll have to try harder than that, you silly nerf-herder---whoa!” Suddenly he is on top of her, and she’s looking up at him, an eyebrow raised, “How’s that?” he asks. She looks away as her face turns red, “Get off,” she mutters. He shakes his head, “So you only like it when you’re in charge,” She glares at him, and he only laughs more, “Such a sore loser,” he teases. His grip on her wrists slips and he falls forward, their lips almost touching. She goes still and stares at him, as he stares back. ______________________________________________________ “Anna?” Luke’s voice asks in her ear. Tears stream down her face as they venture into space. “Anna- there was nothing we could do. I’m sorry.” She remains silent, and the ship jerks. “TX, give me the controls,” Luke orders, from the seat behind her. With a beep, Luke takes over and she lets go of the stick, her hands shaking. Closing her eyes, she tilts her head back, letting the tears fall. ***************************************************************************** Ben stepped back, as the vision ended, Anna’s wall coming back up and forcing him out. She stared at him, her arms falling to her sides. As they looked at one another, tears began to fall down her face. Shaking her head she turned away. “Wait,” Ben whispered, grabbing her by the hand. “I’m tired of waiting,” she whispered back. Ben pulled on her arm forcing her to turn back. Slowly, he raised a hand to her face, and she closed her eyes, as he brushed away her tears. His hand left hers, and held her by her bicep. She gasped, as his fingers hooked underneath her chin, and she looked up just in time to see him leaning towards her. Gently, his lips pressed against her. Reaching up, she let her palms rest on his shoulders, not fighting him off, but keeping him from going too far. There were little differences. He was rougher, more hurried. He felt different, he tasted different. Anna sighed. For all the changes it was still him. Ben tilted his head, deepening the kiss, fingers winding themselves in her hair, as he pulled her closer. Slowly his arms made their way around her back, coming to a stop at her waist as her body tensed against his. They broke apart, and looked up at one another. Anna’s breath caught in her throat, as he pressed closer to her, his grip on her tightening, as though he was afraid she was going to sprint away from his arms. Pulling her to his chest, he pressed his lips to her forehead, as she wound her hands around his back returning his strong embrace, “Anna,” he whispered. She let out a gasp, as he bent her back, pushing her to the floor. Her robes billowed out behind her, as she looked up at him. Fingers trailed down her body, before pulling at her sash. Leaning back up Ben removed his gloves, his eyes never leaving hers. Slowly he bent over her, running heated lips over her skin. Warm fingers moved inside the edges of her clothes, and she dared to voice a moan, only to have it captured, by his lips once more. Notes: Hey guys, I hope you are enjoying the story so far. I am working on the next chapter right now. I had it written down yesterday, but my computer crashed, deleting EVERYTHING... So, kids, the moral of this story is: SAVE YOUR WORK!!! Stars and comments are my sustenance!!!!! So, you know... comment!!!! (Luckily the computer is fine, just...I lost the next few chapters I had written) :( This message was brought to you by an angry, Sailor-like cursing, grouchy writer. I could really use some kudos and comments guys.... I lost five chapters.... I don't even know how that happened... I mean, I do but come on! Five chapters! Isn't there like auto save or something! Oh, and Happy New Year... 2016 is off to a great start Chapter 12 : BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Anna woke up screaming. It’s too loud! Cold hands pushed her down, and a voice called out to her over the roaring waves of pain that rushed through her body, mind, and soul. Everything was bright, and try as she might, she couldn’t speak, see, or control anything that was happening to her. “Shit, it’s the---Anna, let it--- just brea----,” the voice cut off as her body went rigid. Her lungs burnt, unable to take any needed air in. If she could have she would have screamed. Then it was like the tide of pain withdrew, and she eased to the surface. Her body relaxed, and sweat slicked her skin. Then the sound came back, and she could hear a series of whimpers echoing throughout the room. Then she realized: the sound was coming from her. Weak and tired she opened her eyes, as a cool hand pushed back her hair. “Shhhhh.” She looked up, Ben was leaning over her wiping her forehead, trying to calm her down. Tears ran down the sides of her face as she began to sob. Ben wiped those away too, guilt present on his face, “Shhhhh, it’s alright now.” “What---,” she stopped as she gasped for air, “What was that?” Ben looked away from her ashamed, “The drug. It wore off.” She sat up, swaying from side to side She looked around the room, at the clothes strewn everywhere, the sheets wrapped around her body, trying to remember exactly how they had made it back to his quarters. But all of that was meaningless as he walked to the table returning with another bottle. At the sight of it she scrambled away from him, pulling the sheets with her. She was weak and drained but she could feel the edges of the power of the Force. It was back now, and she wasn’t going to lose it again. “Nn-NO---,” she yelled, kicking at him. Ben threw the bottle to the side, and it shattered against the wall, the liquid dripping down onto the floor. Looking back at her he crouched down and held his hands up in front of himself. “I’m not going to do that again, I swear,” he said, trying to calm her down. He looked away, “I’m sorry,” he whispered. Anna pressed herself against the wall, staring at him. “I’m sorry, I didn’t want you to go through…that.” he said again. Her body relaxed a little, but her hands were still clenched around the sheets she was using to cover her body. Ben took a step towards her, hands still outstretched, and Anna’s breath hitched. Slowly, he got on the bed. His hand rested on her ankle, stroking in small circles. “The drug,” he explained, “It’s temper mental. You can’t just stop dosing, it has to be a gradual, steady depletion.” “And if it’s not?” Ben looked up at his fingers stopping their ministrations, “Most test subjects went insane,” he answered quietly. They were silent for a moment. “And the ones who didn’t go insane?” she asked. He shook his head, and pinched the bridge between his eyes, “I don’t know.” “Then I guess, it’s a good sign that I’m not knocking you around the room, isn’t it?” she said. Ben looked down, “Anna---.” The sound of a fist pounding on the door, startled them both. Ben turned around, “Who is it?” he yelled dropping his voice an octave. The sound echoed through the room once more. Getting off of the bed, he picked up their clothes, throwing a robe to Anna. The door began to open with a hiss, and Ben stepped in front of the girl as she started to dress. General Hux, and several armed guards sauntered into the room. HE glanced around the room, with his nose in the air, before his eyes shifted to Ben, “Lord Ren,” he began. Ben tensed, and Anna laid a hand on the small of his back, as they listened, “I have orders from the Supreme Leader. Surrender the girl or I will be forced to escort you from the ship.” “She has no information to offer you, General. Perhaps you should look elsewhere. Even you cannot be so inept that you can’t locate a rebel contingent,” Ben spat. Hux took a step forward, his guards following, “You forget your place, Ren.” “Then why don’t you remind me?” Ben hissed staring down at the man. Hux narrowed his eyes, before turning around, waving to his guards, “Subdue him,” he ordered. The guards looked at one another, “Arrest him!” Hux yelled. With hesitant steps they took a step towards, him, when Ben threw his hands in the air, pushing them back, “Stay away,” he commanded. Out of the corner of her eye, Anna could see Hux taking aim. With a shout she stepped into his line of fire. “Dantooine!” she yelled. She stumbled to the side, as her vision went spotty, but strong arms caught her. She looked up, everyone staring at her silently. Ben furrowed his brow but she gripped his arm. Hux cleared his throat, “What… did you say?” Anna swallowed before answering, “Dantooine. They’re on Dantooine.” Notes: Okay so I meant to have this out sooner, but a friend invited us to his wedding two hours before the ceremony… soooooooooooo it’s been a long day…. Again. Short chapter, but work with what you can get. Also, thanks for the wonderful feedback and interest you guys are showing in this fic. Reading your comments, really makes me want to write more. Thanks again! Chapter 13 : BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “Dantooine. They’re on Dantoonie.” Ben tensed behind her as Hux stepped towards them, but she dug her nails into his arm, You can blow him to bits later, she thought to herself, as a gloved hand grabbed her by the chin. “How did you come by this information?” he asked. “My padawan. She was privy to the rendezvous and transfer points of the Resistance. As her master, I had… access. You’ll find them on Dantooine.” Hux looked over her shoulder at Ben, “It seems you’ve lost your touch, Ren, was it really that difficult for you? I took less than a minute.” Ben grit his teeth, “Yes, but I assume most things take you less than a minute, if your liaisons are anything to go by.” Hux narrowed his eyes, before focusing on Anna, “I hope your information is fruitful. It would be such a waste to destroy such beauty,” he said as his fingers grazed her cheek. Anna flinched, as Ben’s hand shot over her shoulder, grabbing the man by the wrist. Another hand pushed her out of the way, and by the time she had turned around, Hux was on his knees. “Ben,” Anna whispered. His eyes turned on her, remnants of red fire in his iris. His face relaxed and he turned back to the spluttering mess on the floor, “Get. Out.” He let go of the General’s arm, and straightened his back. With a grunt the man fell backwards. Everyone watched as he stood from the floor, and turned to the door, one hand wrapped firmly around his injured wrist. “I’ll be sure to document your cooperation in my report, Lord Ren,” he said as he walked out of the room, the guards limping out behind him. The door closed, and Ben whirled around grabbing her by her shoulders, “Are you insane?” he hissed. Anna shook her head. "We just talked about this, I feel fine. I mean just a little fatigued, maybe a little nauseous--- "Anna," he said tightening his grip, visibly unamused by her attempts to change the subject. “What was I supposed to do? He was going to shoot you.” “I can protect myself. I didn’t need your help---,” Ben broke off as Anna looked away. “I’m sorry, I just…” Ben sighed, “You have to leave,” he said as he walked over to his locker. “Why?” she asked as she turned to follow him Taking out a tunic Ben pulled it over his head, before throwing her a blaster, “Are they really on Dantooine?” he asked, as he wrapped his belt around his waist. “Noooo,” she said slowly. “Then the second Hux figures out that you lied, he’ll be coming back here with a full battalion,” he flung a pair of pants at her and a tunic, both too big for her, but necessary. “I can get you to a ship, but---.” “No,” Anna said, her eyes burning into his. “Anna-.” She moved towards him swiftly, “I’m not leaving without you, not this time.” He scoffed, “And where will we go? Your Resistance holds nothing for me.” Anna shook her head and tried to speak, but he cut in, “I’m too dark, Anna, they will never take me back.” She bit her lip, “I’m not leaving you here.” Ben’s ran his hands up and down her arms before pulling her to his chest. She closed her eyes, inhaling the scent of him, as he pressed his lips to her forehead. “I feel it, Ben, the light. Don’t run away from it, from me. Not again.” With a harsh thrust he pushed her away, “Wait here, then make your way down to the hanger.” And just like that he was gone. ************************************************************************ “Lord Ren!” exclaimed the senior officer on the bridge. Everyone stood at attention as he walked to the observation window, the C.O. falling into step beside him. “All preparations to proceed to the Dantooine system are complete sir.” “Where is General Hux,” he asked as he went to stand in front of a consol. “He is indisposed at the moment sir. Supreme Leader Snoke required his attention.” Waving his hand in front of the console the young man waved the officer off, “As you were.” With a salute the man returned to his duties. Bending over the computer, he punched in a series of numbers and then looked up at the screen. Dantooine System; Raioballo Sector; L-4; …Broadcast coordinates? His eyes scanned over the control room behind him. Turning back he tapped on the screen. Approved: data sent. “I see you’re beginning to take an interest in the Order’s affairs once more?” a voice asked behind him. He waved his hand in front of the computer clearing the data, before he turned around. “General,” he said sternly. “I just spoke with our superior, Lord Ren, and he hoped I might pass on a little message,” Hux sneered as he signaled the officer from before to begin taking them into hyperspace, “Should the information prove to be worthless, you are to be returned to the Supreme Leader’s side.” He glanced over at the man behind him, “Unfortunately, he doesn’t need the girl. A shame really. Here we all were hoping you might have finally found someone to…oh, what is the phrase?” he asked sarcastically as he signed a data pad, “Someone to settle down with?” Notes: You guys are awesome! So, here's a bonus chapter for the day. Also I'm getting some questions about writing smut for this story. It's not really my thing but I will see what I can do. If anyone has some pointers, feel free to hit me up. Other than that does anybody have some ideas about what they might like to see? I MIGHT write a special chapter just for you guys, you never know so leave a note with your suggestions. See you guys tomorrow! P.S. Oh, no! What will Ben do next?!?!?!?! Chapter 14 : BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Anna pulled on a pair of boots, when the console started beeping. Ben had been gone over an hour, and she ran over to punch the button. Two words scrolled across the screen, Go now. They disappeared only to be replaced by a set of blueprints, a trail leading from her position to the opposite end of the ship. She stared at the screen for a few minutes, memorizing the route. Pulling her hair back, she walked out the door. She traipsed down the hall until she came to the turn, Left , she thought, remembering the blueprints. Footsteps echoed and before she could hide two Stormtroopers marched right into her. The two soldiers glanced at one another. “Clearance,” one of them ordered. Anna cleared her throat, and waved a hand in front of them, “You don’t need to see my clearance.” They looked at one another once more. With a shout she dodged the storm trooper’s fist. The other soldier grabbed her by the hair as the other turned around. Reaching around, she grabbed her assailant by the arm, and lurched forward, pulling him over her back. The trooper yelled as he was flipped over and slammed into the floor. Anna whirled around, looking for the other attacker. A head lodged itself in her stomach, as the man tackled her, pushing her against the wall behind her. All the air in her lungs was expelled in one great huff, as she crashed into the wall. Straightening up, the trooper grabbed her by her forearms, trying to force her to the ground. Anna’s basic instinct kicked in as they grappled. Behind her the other trooper rose from the ground. As she fought with the smaller of the two, the one from before, readied to strike her from behind. With a yell, she released her hold on the man and dropped to the floor, swinging her leg out, clipping him on the ankle. A bone chilling crack sliced through the air, as she broke his ankle; tearing the tendons, and shattering bone. The other attacker swung, missing her head by a mere inch. With one on the ground and the other lunging to tackle her, Anna jumped and took off in a sprint. Several shots blasted past her and she ducked around the corner, taking her blaster from her belt. She looked down the hall, a vent large enough for her to fit through at the other end. “Come out with your hands up,” the trooper yelled. Anna rolled her eyes, “Why? It’s not like you can aim,” she mocked. The soldier didn’t respond, but she could hear footsteps approaching her position. Anna crouched down, and took a deep breath. She started a mental countdown: 1, 2, 3! With a yell she took off in a sprint firing several shots through the doorway. A yell and a thud resounded behind her, and she knew she had hit her target. Taking aim she fired at the grate, creating a hole large enough to climb through. Pulling up her hood she disappeared into the vents. ************************************************* “We’ll be coming out of hyperspace in a moment, General,” a lieutenant reported. Hux turned around, “I assume you will be wishing to take part in the action, Lord Ren?” he asked. The young man was configuring something on the computer, “Only if your men don’t screw it up first.” ************************************************* Stepping back, and sitting on her haunches, Anna closed her eyes, feeling for the Force. She set her blaster on the ground and tried to focus on it, lift it. “Blast it,” she hissed. The power was there. She could sense it, but it was as though a wall was separating her from it. She put the gun in its holster, and crawled forward. Whatever was in that drug, it was still affecting her some way. The muttered under her breath. The next time she saw Ben he was going to get a piece of her mind. *************************************************** The bridge was in a frenzy from the moment they had exited hyperspace. As they orbited the planet, they met no resistance, which only seemed to make Hux even more irate. “Prepare all tie fighters to disembark,” Hux ordered. “But sir---!” an officer objected. Hux turned and glared, sending the little man running back to his station, all objections long forgotten. Ben had to hand it to the man, what he lacked in sensibility he more than made up for in fearful leadership. Ben took a step forward and stared down at the planet, “You plan to bomb the entire planet?” he asked, “Aren’t you a little overzealous?” The general scoffed, “To drive a rat from its nest, sometimes you have to set fire to the entire forest.” “Yes, but we’re not searching for a rat now, are we?” Hux opened his mouth when a Storm trooper walked up to them, “Sir.” The soldier handed him a data pad. The First Order officer, read through the file. “Hmmmm.” “What is it?” Ben asked gruffly, growing increasingly impatient. “It seems your pet was caught trying to escape to the hanger bay,” Hux answered glancing at Ben, “She seriously injured one of my men before she disappeared.” Ben raised his head, his face staying impassive at the news, “She was secure when I left her.” Hux watched him for a moment, “Let’s hope so, for your sake, Lord Ren.” “Sir long range scanners are picking up on a formation!” someone yelled. General Hux ran over to the console, “It’s the Resistance, deploy all fighters.” ************************************************** Boom!! Anna sat up at the sound of an explosion. It was close, probably just to the rear of the ship. Alarms began to blare, and she could see red lights flashing in the hallway beneath her. ************************************************** Ben ran down the corridor, trying to avoid the mass of troops walking through the halls. He stopped as a platoon ran by, “We have intruders in sector twelve,” one of them said as they ran by. Ben ran over the Finalizer’s construction and structure in his mind, Sector 12 would be the hanger. ********************************* Dakka-dakka. Anna jumped at the sound of blaster fire in the hallway. Several shouts echoed down the corridor, before disappearing completely. Footsteps ran down the hall before stopping in front of her door. The sound of a computer being spliced rung in her ears before the door below her opened. A droid chortled and Anna cocked her head. TX? Sure enough she saw the droid moving beneath her. Anna lifted her leg and kicked at the vent grate, busting it open. With a soft landing she dropped to the floor. She looked up just in time to see the droid getting its flamethrower ready to fire at her. Swiftly she pulled down her hood, “Hey, bolts, it’s me.” The droid whistled and sped towards her, as she stood up, “Yeah, I’m happy to see you too,” she laughed. The droid stopped in front of her and opened up its storage compartment. Anna frowned and bent down removing a small package. She opened it and stared at it silently. TX whined. “Where did you get this?” she asked. The droid rolled back and forth as it whistled off a series of notes. Anna shook her head and chuckled, “Oh, so you have a long story too?” VNNNNNNNN. Anna flicked the switch on the hilt and activated the weapon, revealing a blue-green hue she hadn’t seen in years. “There they are!” a voice yelled from behind her. Anna blocked the blaster fire, and TX sent a thermal detonator rolling down the hall. Turning away she sprinted through the doors, the astromech droid following closely behind. She huffed. The grenade blasted behind them and TX closed the blast doors before the fire and decompression could reach them. Anna wiped her forehead on her sleeve and watched as TX took off down the hall without her. “Hey slow down!” The droid kept going tweeting and trilling as he went. Anna ran to catch up, “Yeah I know we need to get to the hanger.” TX spun around. Anna stopped in her tracks and set her hands on her waist, “What do you mean Chewbacca’s is setting charges?” “Hey, you,” a voice called behind her. Anna whirled around, blue light reflecting off her skin. A Stormtrooper lanky and small looked up at her, “Aren’t you a little short for a Storm trooper?” Anna asked. Gloved hands reached up to remove the helmet, revealing bright eyes, and brown hair. “Rey?” Anna exclaimed. The girl smiled, as Anna grabbed her and wrapped her arms around her. Rey returned the hug briefly, before she pushed the knight away and spoke into her earpiece, “I’ve got her!” she relayed. “Good job, TX,” she said. Anna looked confused as she stepped away from the girl, but before she could ask, Rey was pulling her down the hall. Anna peered ahead of her seeing another enemy advancing on them. She readied herself to attack, but Rey caught her by the shoulder, “Wait.” The trooper reached up and removed his helmet. Anna’s breath caught in her throat and she took off down the corridor in a sprint. Hot tears ran down her face as she crashed into another “trooper.” “Slow down there!” Luke yelled, as she wrapped him in a hug, “I’m getting too old for this, you know,” he said begrudgingly, but his smile betrayed him. “How did you---?” Anna asked, lost for words. She stepped away from the old master, who nodded to Rey. “Your padawan. She can be very persuasive.” Another explosion shook the ship and they all stumbled. Luke and Rey looked at one another. “We need to get to the hanger,” Rey said, pushing them down the hall. Luke turned but Anna caught him by the wrist, “Not without Ben.” Rey looked confused but Luke didn’t miss a beat, “Anna, we have to go, Chewbacca is already setting the charges.” “I’m not leaving without him. Not again.” Luke narrowed his eyes, “You’ve seen him,” he said. It wasn’t a question. “There’s good in him, Luke. He’s still in there.” Anna looked back at Luke pleading, and she could see him considering his options within his mind’s eye. Her heart sunk as he shook his head, “We have to go, Anna.” She shook her head, but he laid a hand on her shoulder, “We’re no good to him if we’re dead.” They jumped at the sound of another explosion. The ship shook and they stumbled forward. Luke turned and looked at her. Anna grit her teeth and gave a nod. With that they took off down the corridor. Anna yelled over the alarms, “How did you find me?” “Someone sent us the Finalizer’s coordinates.” The Jedi knight looked at her incredulous, “And you just came in blind? What if it was a trap?” “Well, it wasn’t. We did find you,” Rey pointed out. Anna shook her head, “But---.” Luke cut her off, “I think we can discuss it later.” He nodded to the end of the hall. From there she could see a large group of storm troopers. Rey groaned, “What now?” Anna thought back on the blueprints in Ben’s quarters, “We split up.” The other two looked at her as though she was crazy. She pointed down the halls to her left and right, “We each take a direction, and the corridors each lead into the hanger. They’ll have to split their focus.” Luke frowned, “We can take them,” Anna insisted, “Trust me.” She stared at the old Jedi, until he looked away with a sigh. “Rey,” he said. The girl raised her eyebrows, “You take the left. Anna, right, and I’ll go straight.” The youngest of them, gave a nod and started down her corridor. Anna turned to do the same, only to have Luke catch her by the shoulder. She turned around, “You’ve changed,” he said. Anna frowned, “Your presence… you feel different in the Force.” She gave a smile and patted him on the back, “I’m fine.” “Anna.” She shook her head and stepped away from him, “I’ll see you in a minute,” and she took off down the hall. ****************************** “Sir, they’re making their way back into the hanger.” “Good. Have Captain Phasma meet me on that level. I want them alive.” The captain gave a salute, “General.” ******************************* Anna walked down the hall. From her position she could see directly across the hanger to the other side. Rey gave a nod. VNNNNNNNN. The Jedi Knight bent her knees and held her sword at the ready. Several shots rung out, and she looked over to see Luke fighting. Rey let out a yell and entered the fray, taking out several troopers all at once. Anna was slower. Silently, she stepped behind a group of soldiers taking aim at Luke and Rey. She cleared her throat. Slowly the group turned around. One by one they started shooting, and Anna quickly deflected them, sending several flying back towards the troopers. Then she began to advance, and they began to retreat. She looked around, seeing Rey and Luke doing the same thing. Rey parried slicing a trooper down his back, while Luke continued to herd them into a group together. Anna saw movement up on the scaffolding as she fought off a trooper with a vibroblade. Snipers. She looked at where they were aiming. “Rey!!” A shot louder than all the others went off in the hanger. The troopers held their fire and the sound of marching footsteps echoed down the hall behind her. Anna stumbled, as Rey turned around and looked at her. She looked down. Red blood began to seep through her clothes. Rey screamed as Anna fell to her knees. “Cold,” she whispered, as Rey appeared in front of her, pressing a hand to her mentor’s chest, trying to stop the bleeding. Anna fell forward, but Rey caught her. She looked up, to see troopers surrounding them as Rey held onto her. Luke stood over them protectively, When did you get here? She thought. Her hands shook as Rey’s tears started to drip down on her face. “Ben,” she whispered as she closed her eyes. A man stepped forward in officer’s dress, “Surrender your weapons,” he ordered. ******************************************* Ben stumbled as pain, fear, and panic floodedthrough him. “ Ben…” a voice whispered. He leaned against a wall and tried to catch his breath. Shaking his head he pushed off of the wall and ran down the hall. “Surrender your weapons,” Hux’s voice echoed. Ben peered through the opening Hux and thirty troopers surrounding their quarry. He slowed down and walked towards them listening. “If you think it will be that easy---,” Luke Skywalker’s voice echoed back. Ben nearly stopped in his tracks. Nearly. A trooper turned at the sound of his footsteps, and moved out of the way. Ben pushed past him. Luke stood ready to fight, while a girl--- the girl, from Star Killer base knelt on the ground, holding onto a small body. Ben grit his teeth at the sight. Hux turned around, “Ah, Lord Ren. How kind of you to join us.” Ben reached behind his back and and brought forward his saber. VMMMMMMMM. Hux moved beside him with a smirk and looked back at Luke in obvious victory. Red light reflected in Ben’s eyes as he stared at his old master. Anger coiled in his gut, and he hardened his grip on the hilt of his sword. Luke turned to him, “Ben, you don’t have to do this.” “I know,” he answered, “But I want to.” Notes: Sooooo, this has been an interesting week. For those of you who do not know, I live in Alaska (It's very interesting but we can talk about that later). Anyways, my family and I were driving up to see the tallest mountain in North America (Extra points if you know what I am talking about. hint: It's not McKinley). Everything was fine until we hit a patch of ice, and spun out into a snow drift. If the snow drift hadn't been there we would have rolled. Everyone is fine, the truck is dented all to hell but we're alive. I guess I just needed to share that with someone. I spent all day trying to figure out how to write this chapter. I've rewritten it about three times tonight, since I didn't have my computer with me. I hope you enjoy it. I may post the follow up chapter tomorrow, but I am pretty happy with this cliffhanger, so I might just let you guys stew over it for a day or two...maybe three (I'm feeling a little devilish). COMMENTS AND KUDOS MAKE ME WRITE FASTER!!! ...just sayin'. Chapter 15 : BOOK I: FINDING BALANCE Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Luke stood his ground as Ben took a step towards him, “Ben,” he said in warning. The boy stopped. “What are you waiting for?!” Hux yelled. Ben looked at the floor, blue eyes staring up at him. Anger built up in his chest and he lowered his sword. What he was about to do---was it worth it? Was she worth it? She was broken, bleeding there on the floor, just as weak, just as shattered as he had been. Anna moved her hand, a silver cylinder in her hand. He stared at the object wide eyed as her hand collapsed onto the floor beside her, the lightsaber locked to her palm. The girl--- What was her name? Rey? ---- he wondered, rested a hand on Anna’s forehead as the woman closed her eyes. The padawan, looked up at them her eyes burning. Ben stepped back, as Luke stepped in front of them, blocking his view, “We can still help her Ben. You can---.” “I tried to help her, and look what happened,” he hissed back. Luke lowered his weapon, “Ben, if she stays here, she’ll die. Even you can’t want that.” Ben turned his back on him, and walked toward Hux, “You know nothing about me, you never did.” “I know you sent us the coordinates.” Ben stopped. “He what?” Hux spat stepping away from Ben. “You tried to save her once,” Luke said, “Be strong, Ben, help me take her home. Help me take you home.” “And if I do?” he asked, “Am I to assume that all will be forgiven?” Luke’s face morphed with pain and he looked down. Ben shook his head, “I thought so.” “I should have searched harder and faster,” Luke called after him, as he turned away, “What happened to you, what they did to you--- blame me, Ben. Not her. Not the Galaxy. Just me.” Hux stepped in between them as Ben turned around, his face ashen and pale. “Take them into custody,” the General said with a wave of his hand. Troopers grabbed Rey from behind and dragged her away from Anna, kicking and screaming. Luke turned around just in time to meet with a stun baton. The old man groaned and doubled over. As the two Jedi were subdued, Hux strode over to Anna. Her chest just barely rising and falling. Taking out his blaster he pointed it down at her head, and took aim, “Such a waste.” “No!” a shout rang out. Hux looked up just in time to see a flash of red soaring at him. Red hot pain shot through him as the sword cut through his forearm, severing his hand from his arm. The man gave a gruesome scream as he doubled over, holding the stub, smoke rising from the wound. (CUE STAR WARS FIGHT MUSIC) Everyone watched as the lightsaber soared back to its master. Striding forward, Ben caught the saber in the air over his head and ran towards them. Luke and Rey’s captors stood around speechless. Hux’s eyes grew as he saw the man running towards him. Pressing his arm to his torso, he pushed himself off the ground and ran in the opposite direction. As he stumbled he screamed over his shoulder as he made his escape, “Kill them!” The troopers opened fire immediately. With a yell, Ben cut through two soldiers, pushing their bodies with enough force to wipe out several of the troops behind him. Rey bent her knees, before throwing her head back, colliding with the trooper holding her arms behind her back. The soldier yelled, and Rey rolled forward on the ground, using the force to pull the man’s blaster from his grasp. Taking aim, she pulled the trigger. Three troopers fell, and she spun around firing a series of shots at the troopers holding onto Luke. Working together, Ben and Luke fought off the hand-to-hand specialists, as Rey covered them. Ben turned as the last trooper fell. He started to take after Hux, but a hand caught him. He turned around, to find Luke holding onto his arm, “We have to go!” the old man yelled. They both staggered as the ship lurched from the shock of another explosion. A roar sounded behind them. Ben turned around, as a great ball of fur barreled towards him, only to be stopped by Luke, “Chewie, it’s okay.” Ben took a step back as the Wookie reached for him. Rey yelled at them. “We need to leave. Now.” Luke took off and ran over to Rey and Anna. Chewbacca pointed his gun at Ben, who held his hands up and followed after the old Jedi. Luke bent down, and picked the girl up, blood smearing across his chest. Ben tried to help, but Rey blocked him, “Give me your arm,” she ordered. Another quake shook the ship, “Now,” she yelled. He did as she said. She took a scanner from her bag, and ran it over his skin. “There,” Rey said breathlessly. Reaching down to her belt she took out a knife, as big hairy arms wrapped themselves around Ben’s chest. He struggled. He couldn’t see past the Wookies’ arms but he could feel something pressing against his arm. A sharp, tearing pain tore through his limb and a squelching noise made its way to his ears. A scream tore from his throat as Rey’s fingers dug in beneath his skin and muscles, “Aaaaaand you’re good.” Chewbacca released him and Ben fell to the ground, pressing his arm to his chest. A small metal disk clattered on the ground next to him. “Did you even know they were tracking you?” Rey asked, “Keep an eye on him Chewie,” she said. The Wookie barked and pushed him up the ramp. ********************************************* Chewbacca chained him to the pipes, away from anything too important, and ran to the cockpit. Looking across the holo table Ben watched as Luke tried to stop the bleeding. Anna laid on the table, her shirt torn open, covered in blood. A gaping hole tore through the side of her chest. “Rey, there’s some Bacta spray in that bag,” Luke said frantically, as he pressed a pad to the wound. Rey set down Anna’s lightsaber and found the bag. A hand caught Luke’s and he looked down, “Anna,” he said. She pulled him down, weakly. The man complied and leaned down as she whispered something. Luke looked up and back at Ben, “He’s here,” he said. Anna’s arm fell. The ship lurched, as Chewbacca maneuvered them away from the Finalizer’s hanger. Ben looked at the computer screens broadcasting the feed from the rear view cameras. The Star Destroyer grew smaller as they traveled faster and faster. A burst of light exploded from the starboard, traveling the length of the ship. Soon the Finalizer, was enveloped in the blast . It was gone. “Here,” Rey said handing a bottle with a long nozzle, to Luke. Uncapping it, Luke set a hand on Anna’s shoulder and motioned to Rey to do the same on the other side. “Hold her down.” Luke leaned down and jammed the end of the nozzle into the wound. Anna’s back arched off of the table and a low groan of pain rumbled through the room. With a hiss, Luke pulled the trigger releasing the spray. After a few seconds Luke pulled back and Anna’s body relaxed. Above her head, the stats console turned green as her body stabilized. Rey wiped her face, and grabbed a towel wiping the blood off her hands as best she could. She looked up to see Ben watching them and scowled. Luke nodded to the cockpit, “Chewie probably needs some help.” Gritting her teeth the girl disappeared down the hallway. With a sigh, Luke sat in the booth and looked over at Ben. “I swear for the past five years, you’re the only reason she kept going.” Ben looked down at his hands, “You should have left me there,” he said quietly. “Anna would have killed me. Not to mention your mother.” Ben looked up his breath catching in his throat, and Luke raised an eyebrow, “So you remember her. Good. I thought that maybe after Han died, you had truly forgotten her.” “Where are you taking me?” Ben asked, desperation heavy in his voice. Luke frowned, anger burning in his eyes “If it was up to me---,” he cut himself off, and stood up, “Anna needs medical attention. She’s lost a lot of blood. Thanks to you though, she at least has a chance. I never thought I would say anything thankful about you again.” He turned and walked over to the girl. Ben grit his teeth, “What do you want from me?” he hissed, “Some heartfelt apology?” “I want to help you, Ben.” The young man shook his head, “You’re a little late don’t you think? You left me there, alone. Why is now any different?” “No, I don’t think we are.” Luke grazed his fingertips along Anna’s cheek then turned around and faced him, “As long as there is light in you, we will keep trying to pull you back.” “There is no light,” Ben argued. The old Jedi chuckled, “You were never a very good liar.” Luke crossed his arms and stared at the dark Jedi. “You’re angry, Ben, but I know you feel it, calling to you.” Ben looked away, and bit the inside of his cheek. “You aren’t my teacher anymore.” “You’re right, but the way I see it, you aren’t going anywhere for a while.” Rey walked back into the room, “We’re a few minutes out, Master Skywalker.” Her eyes avoided Ben’s, “General Organa has the medics and an armed guard standing by.” “Thank you, Rey.” The girl glanced over at Anna, before going back to the cockpit. Luke sighed and wiped a hand down his face. “They’re going to want to know everything you do.” “I’ve been tortured and interrogated before,” Ben’s answer was monotonous, as he stared straight into the older man’s eyes. Luke frowned, “They aren’t going to torture you, Ben.” He shrugged, “Their mistake.” Luke was silent as they descended, before the ship finally set down. Without a word, the Jedi walked over to Anna, placing one hand beneath her back and the other behind her knees. With a grunt he lifted her off the table. Ben watched as Luke carried her past him. Her head and long brown hair hung back, almost lifelessly, except for the subtle rise and fall of her chest. As Luke disappeared down the exit ramp, Rey and Chewbacca came to retrieve him. The Wookie undid his restraints but kept a firm hold on his shoulder, as they walked down the ramp. Wind and salty air met them as they walked down from the ship. Luke was setting Anna down on a tram, medics, guards, and officers ran around before the vehicle pulled away from the landing pad. Ben’s eyes settled on one person, as the group turned around to face him, Rey, and Chewbacca. Pushing her way forward, Leia Organa came to a halt at the front of the group. Her eyes were wide, filled with pain as she took in the sight of him. The Wookie pushed him forward and he stumbled. The older woman walked up to him, staring up at him, as tears began to run down her face. Ben clenched his jaw as he looked at her, “Mom.” Epilogue “Where is the First Order Base?” Captain Ara’ve slammed his hands down on the metal table. Rey watched as Ben leaned back, crossed his arms and looked up at the Quarren, “I. Don’t. Know.” Rey shook her head. Maybe he really didn’t know. He could escape. He knew it, and they knew it as well. The door opened behind her, “What are you doing here?” Finn asked. She shook her head, “Learning,” she replied. Turning around she turned off the speakers and leaned against the window, “How is she?” Finn shrugged, “They’ve got her in the bacta tank, but it’ll be a while. Days, maybe a week. There’s a chance she might...” he trailed off, “Ara’ve is already going after him then?” Rey looked over her shoulder, “General Organa was here, for a few moments. Then they let him sit for a while.” “He deserves worse than this,” Finn hissed. His hands gripped the handrail in a death grip. Rey met his gaze, before she looked away, “What?” he asked, “After what he did, all those people he killed---and what he did to you and me, and his own father--- you don’t think he has it coming?” “I don’t know.” Finn grit his teeth, and pushed off the handrail, “He’s a monster, Rey.” “Anna didn’t---doesn’t think so.” The young man glared at the man behind the glass, “Anna is blind where he’s concerned, Rey, and she might die because of it.” Notes: So, this is the end of book one. Book two will continue to be posted here. This is just to make it easier to organize, so it’s more for me than for you. You guys are awesome. Thanks so much for reading, and commenting, I can’t wait to see what happens next with this story!!!!! Lots of love---Mahana Chapter 16 : BOOK II : GREY AREA Notes: Let me just start off by saying that you guys are so much more fun to write for than the Wattpad group (Korevescence_9, you are the only exception). I love reading your comments, and seeing your reactions to the story. So, here it is, Chapter 1 of Book 2: Grey Area. Fingers ran up and down her spine softly, and her arms prickled with goosebumps. A moan escaped her as she snuggled deeper into the bed, pulling the sheets up, warding off the cool air. Strong arms wrapped themselves around her, long legs intertwining with hers. With a soft sigh she rolled over, a warm breath chuckling in her ear. “Anna.” She moaned as she burrowed underneath the covers. Her hands moved over smooth skin and taut muscles. The bed shifted as her soothing touches gave way to risqué strokes. A smile tugged at her lips, as two hands wrapped themselves around her own pinning her to the bed. A heated chest moved over her, as she was pushed onto her back. She let her body go limp, and she kept her eyes closed. If not for the smile on her face, one would assume she was asleep. Heated lips grazed her collarbone, moving up her neck, before resting next to her ear. A heated breath caressed her skin, “You need to wake up. Come on, Anna, wake up.” ********************************************* She was floating. Pale light shined down on her as she opened her eyes. Brown hair floated around her, as Anna bobbed up and down in the tank. A face appeared next to her, and she let out a scream, only to have it swallowed by the breathing mask secured around her face. A voice spoke in her ear, “Commander, calm down. You’re going to tear the sutures.” She looked down at herself, her chest beginning to ache. Bandages wrapped around her torso, and every time she moved the middle of her chest stung with pain. “We’re going to give you a sedative, Anna, just try to relax.” The voice faded away as her body went numb, and the world disappeared. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The lights were dimmer when she opened her eyes. The breathing mask was gone, but the ceiling above her was unfamiliar. Panic began to set in. Her heart raced and a loud beeping noise rung in her ears. A blurry shape appeared over her head, and she realized it was a face, when a voice spoke to her. “You’re alright, Commander. Try to calm down,” the face turned away, “General.” Her vision cleared and she recognized the next person to speak to her, “Anna, shhhh, you need to relax. Why do people keep saying that?! Anna struggled to sit up, “Where’s Ben? What did you---ah,” a needle pricked through her skin as a nurse gave her a sedative. Her eyes blinked slowly, as they pushed her back down. Leia smoothed back her hair. “Is he alright?” Anna asked, breathlessly. Leia looked down, and squeezed her hand, “He’s safe.” She looked back up into the girl’s eyes, her mouth pulled into a hard line. “Good,” Anna sighed, as she closed her eyes. The beeps of the heart rate monitor over her head began to slow down. Rubbing a hand across her face Leia let out a sigh. Never taking her eyes of off the bed, she sat down in a chair across the room. “What am I going to do with you two?” ******************************* “General,” the guard said with a salute as Leia Organa walked down the hall. She nodded her head and walked to stand in front of the door. “Has he… done anything?” she asked. “He’s been quiet since this morning, ma’am.” Leia hung her head, “That will be all.” The guard typed a code into the door and stepped back as his superior went inside. The doors closed behind her. It would be impossible to see if it were not for the flickering light coming from an overhead window. She stopped in the center of the room, a dark figure sitting on a cot in the corner of the room. He was staring down at his arm, running his fingers over the healing wound where his tracker used to be. “Ben?” she asked. He looked up, his eyes focusing on her, as though he had only just realized that someone else was in the room. He looked back down at his hands silently. Leia sighed, “She’s awake,” she said. He didn’t move. “They’re keeping her under observation, but she should be fine.” “Did they figure out why it took her so long to recover?” he asked, keeping his eyes focused on the ground. Leia shook her head, “They think it might have been from the drug you gave her.” She walked over to him and sat down next to him with a sigh, “Ben, talk to me.” The man stood up and walked to the other side of the cell. Leia clasped her hands, “She asked for you,” the woman chuckled and shook her head, “The second her eyes were open she wanted to see you.” “Is she---?” Ben cleared his throat as he crossed his arms and shook his head, “I can’t find her.” His voice was hoarse and broke off as he stood with his back turned. Leia frowned and stood up, “What do you mean?” He turned around and looked at her, the scar across his face a stark red against his pale skin, “She isn’t there anymore. The Force… it feels empty.” ************************************ “Should we be worried?” Luke watched Anna through the glass as the medical droid dressed her wounds, “I don’t know,” he said. Leia looked at him her eyes wide. “You can’t feel her either,” she said in shock. “She might just be weak,” Luke said with a shrug. “Ben seemed sure. He said she was invisible, vanished. The Force was empty where she should be.” Luke sat down on a stool and thought, “They’re close, if anything happened to her, he would have felt it before you or I would… And if he was waiting for her to wake up and felt nothing---“he sighed as he looked back up at Leia, “Don’t say anything to her. Whatever Ben gave her, this may be just a side-affect.” “And if it’s not?” Leia asked. “Then we’ll figure it out from there, but she doesn’t need the stress, especially not right now.” Leia turned back to the window with a sigh, “She’ll want to see him.” “You’re asking for trouble, Leia.” She looked over her shoulder at him, “He is my son .” Luke stood up and moved next to her, “That’s exactly the problem. Ara’ve is already pushing to cut Ben off from all external contact.” “He’s given us no reason to do so--.” “Hasn’t he?” Luke hissed, “He murdered innocent people, Leia. He killed---.” A sharp slap rung through the room. Luke pressed a hand to his cheek and looked back at his sister, fire glowing in her eyes, “Don’t you dare mistake my love for my son, as blind ignorance.” She pointed to the door, “I know what he has done. Ben will not go unpunished, but keeping him locked away from the people who can help him, does not make up for all the wrongs he has done.” Luke let his hand fall to his side, “I wasn’t trying to---.” “Yes, you were,” Leia whispered. Without another word she walked into the med room. Luke watched as she walked up next to Anna, laying a hand on the girl’s shoulder. His former student pulled Leia into a haphazard hug. Clasping his hands behind his back he stepped inside the room. “How long was I out?” Anna asked Leia. General Organa glanced at her brother, “Three weeks,” she said. Anna’s brow furrowed, “Three weeks?” Luke stepped next to them, “We think that the drugs you took interfered with your recovery. Combine that with the significant blood loss, the transfusion, surgery, and a week in the Bacta tank… You are very fortunate to be alive.” “I call it luck,” Leia said, with a half-smile. Anna pushed herself off the table slowly. Standing straight legged she tried to take a step, but stumbled. Luke and Leia quickly caught ahold of her. Together they helped her into a wheelchair. “How do you feel?” Luke asked. The girl shrugged her shoulders with a wince of pain, “O-kay,” she wheezed pressing her palm against her chest. They looked at her warily, but she shook her head, “I’m fine, just sore.” Luke and Leia looked at one another questioningly, “What is it?” Anna asked. “Nothing.” Anna raised an eyebrow as they both answered her hurriedly. Letting the matter go she looked down at her hands. Leia frowned, “What’s wrong?” “I--,” she cleared her throat, “Can I see him?” Leia waved Luke off, and pushed Anna to the side of the hallway. Locking the chair into place, she came around and crouched in front of the young woman. She laid her hands on top of Anna’s, “That may not be the best thing to do right now.” The young Jedi narrowed her eyes, “Why?” Luke cleared his throat a couple feet away from them, still within ear shot. He shook his head. Leia tightened her grip on Anna’s hands and grit her teeth, as she looked back at the girl. “Let’s go.” ***************************************** When they got to the cell block, Leia and Luke helped her stand, as they couldn’t risk taking the wheelchair into the room. Something about security protocols. Anna groaned as her chest tightened. “Are you sure about this?” Luke asked. She gave a hard nod. Anna looked up at them, “I can do this myself.” She let go of their hands, and stood shakily. Luke shook his head, “You can’t just---.” Leia cut him off, “She’s fine Luke.” Anna took a few steps forward slowly and Leia said something to the guard and he opened the door. Silently she walked inside. With a nod from his superior the guard closed the door behind her. Luke turned to his sister, “We shouldn’t have let her go in alone.” Leia shook her head, “She’ll be fine Luke. They were together for two months, and he kept her safe.” The elder sibling clenched his jaw as he stomped off down the corridor. ************************************ Her breathing was heavy as the door closed behind her. The room was dark, and silent. Leaning against the wall for support, Anna let her eyes adjust. Slowly, she pushed herself off of the wall, and walked to the center of the room. Moonlight shone down through the window, illuminating her face. In the corner she could see a dark figure huddled up on a cot, his back pressed into the corner. His hands covered his face and he leaned against his knees. “Ben,” she tried to say, but it came out only as a whisper. Anna took in a gulp of air and tried again, “Ben.” He didn’t move. “You aren’t real,” he said. His voice was hoarse and gravelly. Anna dragged her feet until she was standing right next to his cot. With a groan, her legs gave out and she crumpled to the floor. She gasped for air, as she sat on the cold stone floor. Lifting her head, she looked up, startled to find a pale face staring at her, “Anna,” he whispered. She reached out and laid a hand on his foot, “We have got to stop meeting like this.” Chapter 17 : BOOK II : GREY AREA Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Ben reached down, his hands shaking in the streams of moonlight, until he was just inches from her face. Anna looked up at him, grabbing his hand tightly, “It’s me,” she whispered. Ben pushed himself off the cot and knelt in front of her. His eyes were stared at her and she leaned against the bed for support, “You look like you don’t believe it’s me,” she said with a chuckle. She leaned forward, as her laugh turned into a coughing fit. She leaned back and looked up at him. Tentatively, shaking hands framed the sides of her face. “I thought you were dead,” he said, “You should be.” “Surprise,” she whispered back. “I was sure she was lying,” “Who?” He breathed in sharply and looked down, “My… mother.” His left hand ran over the top of her head, smoothing down her hair. She tried to do the same but he pulled her to his chest, “Don’t look at me,” his voice was so shaken that it broke at the end. She leaned against him. His arms held her close, and for the first time since she had woken up she felt… stable, rooted, and safe. They stayed still as statues for minutes, the only sound passing between them was the breaths they each took. After a while, Anna wrapped her hands around his back, “I’m fine, Ben. It’s alright.” “No, it’s not,” he hissed as he pushed her back. His hands held her by the shoulders, as he stared into her eyes. She frowned in confusion and he narrowed his eyes, “You don’t know, do you?” “What?” she asked. The door opened behind him, light shining in from the doorway, “Time’s up,” the guard called. “Just a minute,” Anna shook Ben by the shoulders, “Ben, tell me. What don’t I know?” He looked up at her, his face filled with pain, “Your connection, I---,” Ben looked away, his face overflowing with pain. Anna pressed her hands on both sides of his face, forcing him to look at her, “Ben, you’re scaring me. Just tell me,” she begged. He looked at her, and grazed her cheek with his fingers, “I destroyed you.” Her eyes stared into his. He’s lost it. He’s finally gone mad. Ben shook his head, and ran his fingers through her hair, “I’m not crazy. Can’t you feel it?” Her head shook and she looked up to the ceiling exasperated, “Feel what?” Heavy footsteps sounded behind her and a none too gentle hand pressed down on her shoulder, “Visiting hours are over. I’m going to have to ask you to leave. You can come back tomorrow.” “Back off,” Anna said, shrugging out of the man’s hold. The movement made her chest seize and she hunched over with a gasp of pain. Her head pressed against Ben’s chest. He rubbed her back as she struggled to breathe. “Just give us a minute,” he said, looking up at the guard, “Please.” Anna would have been dumbstruck at the pitiful tone his voice took, if her chest would only relax. “I can’t, Captain Ara’ve insists. No visitors after the second watch.” The guard leaned down and caught her by the elbow, pulling her up. “I’ll make sure she sees a medic,” he said. Ben watched them, his jaw tensing, as his hands balled into fists in his lap. Anna let out a groan of pain, and pressed her hand to her chest. Something sharp, and powerful built up within her, begging for release. “Don’t touch me!” The guard let out a yell as his feet left the ground. “What the---?” he asked in pure terror, before his body flew back, and he landed against the cell door, head first. An ear shattering crack echoed off the stone walls as the guard fell to the ground. His neck was bent at an unnatural angle. Ben sat on his knees in shock as Anna’s body swayed back and forth. “Anna?” A groan answered him, just as her knees buckled. Quickly he caught hold of her, stopping her descent. The door buzzed open as he held her against him on the floor. Her head fell back, and he ran his fingers through her hair. His voice was panicked, and his hands shook, “Anna, wake up, come on An--.” Bright lights blinded him. “Show us your hands. Now!” ************************************************ “The boy has clearly shone that he is not to be trusted,” a councilor said. “I agree something has to be done, before he kills someone else.” Leia bit back on a sigh from the back of the room. She was shut out, unable to say anything on her son’s behalf. Luke stepped into the room quietly, and stood next to her. “How is she?” His face was grim, “Still unconscious, but her stats are stable. No sign of any trauma. The doctor thinks it might have just been stress from the… assault.” Leia shook her head and leaned closer to her brother, “It doesn’t make sense. Why would Ben kill the guard and not try to escape? They found him on the ground with Anna.” Luke shrugged, “Maybe she tried to stop him?” “Then why would he care enough to stick around and make sure she was alright?” Leia shook her head and turned her attention back to the conversation. “If you’ll remember, councilor,” Captain Ara’ve said, clearing his throat, “I assessed the prisoner’s abilities against our security. We don’t have the manpower or the facilities to hold him.” “Then what would you recommend?” Mon Mothma asked standing from her seat. Ara’ve looked over at Luke and Leia for a moment before he pulled up a plan on the holo table, “Going off of his own testimony, I propose that we give him the same drug he gave to Commander Kuro. Suppress his powers.” Luke cut in, “The loss of the Force does not leave him defenseless.” The Captain nodded in agreement, “You’re right, it doesn’t, but it will make him more manageable. My men are better equipped to deal with hand to hand combat than they are telekinesis.” Leia stepped in front of the crowd, “You haven’t even bothered to ask what happened in there. And this drug? We saw what it did to the Commander, and now you want to do the same thing to my son?” A young officer cleared his throat, “I think we all know your opinion on the matter, ma’am.” Leia was just about to shout at the man, when Mon Mothma clapped her hands, garnering everyone’s attention, “What General Organa is presenting is a mother’s opinion. Naturally, she will want what is best for her son,” Leia grimaced as snide looks peered at her from around the table. “But in this instance,” Mon Mothma continued, “She is right. Until we can hear the commander’s testimony the point is moot. If we force this procedure, we put a possible asset at risk. Furthermore, we would be no better than those we are fighting against.” The elderly woman turned to Captain Ara’ve, “Find another way to secure your prisoner.” The council dismissed and Leia walked over to Captain Ara’ve as the room cleared. As soon as he saw her, he started to speak, “General Organa, I-.” “Relax,” she said, as Luke moved to her left, “I just want to know what you are planning to do with Ben.” The Quarren shuffled through a sheet of papers, “I’m not sure, he’s been sedated but we can’t keep him in such a state indefinitely.” Luke crossed his arms, “The report says he was crouched next to Anna. When your found them, did he offer any resistance?” Ara’ve sighed, “No, the sergeant on duty says that he was unusually compliant. He didn’t fight them.” Leia narrowed her eyes, “He didn’t say anything?” “Ma’am…” “Just tell us, Captain.” Straightening his posture the officer clasped his hands behind his back, “He told the guards, ‘I killed him. Just help her.’” *************************************************** “Connect the blue wire to the oscillator then---.” Anna let out a groan as the door behind her opened with a bang. She spun around in her chair, “Do you mind?” Ben froze. His big grin turned sheepish, “Sorry.” “No you’re not,” she said as she turned back to the work table. Ben walked next to her, and leaned over her shoulder, his arms on either side of her, trapping her between him and the table. She took a deep breath and started to work on her project again. “How’s it going?” Ben asked. Anna looked up to the ceiling, “Better than yours.” He chuckled in her ear, “Of course it is, but only because I haven’t started yet.” “And whose fault is that?” Ben pushed off the table and grabbed another stool coming to sit next to her, “Hey, I at least have a plan! I’m going to let you have the honor of failure first. Let it blow up in your face first, figure out what you did wrong, then make my own in perfect condition.” “So that’s why you keep sneaking in here?” she glared at him playfully, “And it’s not going to blow up.” “Sure, whatever you say. No one gets it on the first try. You remember Binks, came out of his room, with his hair singed and holes in his pants.” Anna looked down at the mess before her, “I have a good feeling about this,” she said, “And Binks was an idiot. I am not.” “Want to bet?” “50 credits?” Ben leaned back, “Where are you going to get 50 credits?” “None of your business. Now are you going to take the bet or not?” He shook his head, “Fine. I’ll enjoy watching you pay me with smoke rising from your hair.” He looked her up and down with a cocky smile. Anna pulled on her goggles and turned back, “Joke all you want, you scruffy looking nerf herder.” “Who’s scruffy lookin’?” **** It was dark and the only light in the room was coming from the overhead lamp. Ben was laying on the bed passed out. Anna stretched her arms upwards, her back cracking from the strain of staying in one position too long. She picked up the final piece of the week long puzzle. “Here goes nothing,” she whispered. The glowing crystal moved slowly into its designated position, before a soft snap came from the object laying on the table. Anna let out a sigh of relief. A moan came from the bed and she looked over to see Ben turning onto his side, his legs pulled up, turning him into a human ball. With a smirk Anna walked to the edge of the bed. 1, 2, 3… VNNNNNNNN… Ben shot up out of the bed with a shout a purple glow glaring at him in the darkness. Anna spun the lightsaber in the air, “I think,” she said with a dramatic pause, “You owe me fifty credits, Mr. Solo.” His face was still marred with traces of pure terror, panic, and the remnants of sleep that were still present in his eyes. As realization came to him, he sat down on the bed, “You are such a---!” Anna pointed the saber at him, “Language.” Ben held his hands up, “Such a nice, smart, wonderful person,” he peered up at her, “Please don’t kill me,” he said quickly. The girl let out a laugh, and deactivated the weapon. She tossed it in the air letting it spin, before she caught it again. With a grin on her face she flounced over to the bed, excitedly. “Beat that!” she said punching him in the arm. He shook his head in disbelief, “I can’t believe you did it,” he looked over at her, “And out of everything, you chose purple?” “It goes with my outfits,” she teased. “That’s you,” Ben murmured as he slipped his hands around her waist, “Ever fashion conscious.” His head tilted to the side, and he pulled her close, until their lips met. Anna closed her eyes and let out a moan, “Mmmmm,” her palms pressed against his chest and he pulled away, looking down at her. Shiny blue eyes stared back up at him. Ben cocked his head, “You never really had fifty credits, did you?” She bit her lip. Her tongue licked across her bottom lip as she shook her head, “No.” “Then what were you going to do if you lost?” Anna sat up on her knees, so she could look down at him. One leg swung over his so that she was straddling him, she arms wrapped around his neck, “Well, I thought it might go something like this.” She leaned down, and tilted her head, her hair cascading down the side of her face. Ben stared up at her, until her lips pressed against his jaw. Hot hands made their way to her hips, pulling her flush against him. Anna made warm and tender brushes against his skin, until he whispered in her ear. “So, do I still owe you fifty credits, then?” A laugh escaped her and she pressed against his chest, pushing him onto his back. Her lips pursed as she looked down at him, “You bet your ass, you do.” **************************************************** “Doctor, he’s waking up,” a voice said into the darkness. “Someone get Captain Ara’ve.” Bright light was shining in his eyes, and he could not move his body. “He started showing signs of activity about twenty minutes ago.” “Alright, I’ll take it from here. Ben?” He looked up and squinted through the light. A Quarren the same one who had been questioning him for three weeks was standing in front of him. “Anna,” Ben rasped, his mouth dry. His head throbbed with pain. “She’s still unconscious, but she’ll be fine.” “She’s alive?” “Yes. Ben, I need to know what happened.” The young man closed his eyes, “I killed the guard. Anna tried to stop me. I- hah-- didn’t mean to hurt her.” The captain crossed his arms, “You’re sure that’s what happened?” “Yes,” he hissed. “Why did you kill him?” The prisoner was silent. “Ben? Why did you kill the guard?” A beeping noise sounded behind him, and Ben’s vision began to black out. “Alright, that’s enough,” an unseen person said, “He needs to rest.” The captain’s voice became urgent, “Hold on. Ben, just tell me. Why did you attack him?” The man began to cough. Once he could breathe he looked straight at the Quarren, before he passed out. “Do I need a reason?” Notes: I'd really like to know what you guys think of the story so far! Need some feedback if you have some time! :) Chapter 18 : BOOK II: GREY AREA Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Leia stood at the back of the crowd as they made their way into the atrium of the base. Luke fell into step beside her. She frowned, “What are you doing here?” she asked. Luke kept his eyes focused on the room ahead of them, “Captain Ara’ve requested my presence. Just in case something happens.” “What about Anna?” “Rey’s with her now.” Leia was silent as they took their seats. The Quarren captain passed them by, as he walked down the stairs, “General,” he said with a nod, “Master Skywalker.” They watched him take his seat a few rows ahead of them. Leia leaned to the left and whispered in her brother’s ear, “Have you seen him?” He shook his head, “Have you?” “Ara’ve had the council cancel my clearance. It’s been weeks, Luke.” “It’ll be okay. Have some faith.” She shook her head as Mon Mothma and five other members of the council took their seats at the front of the room. To the side a door opened, and a procession of guards brought in their prisoner. A series of gasps escaped the audience, and Leia grabbed Luke’s hand tightly, “He looks like death,” she whispered. Ben’s eyes scanned the crowd his face a myriad of emotions. He was pale, and Leia could swear he had lost weight. His tunic hung on his body, a size too large. He showed no outward signs of abuse but for each step he took he favored his right leg. She took in a sharp breath as he met her gaze. He gave her a nod before he was forced to sit, shackles restraining him in his seat. “This council is convened to assess the wrongful death of Corporal Kyle Mercor,” Mon Mothma stated. She looked around the room, “Let’s begin.” ************************************ Rey let out a sigh as she sat down in the chair in the corner of the room, in undisturbed silence. Crossing her legs beneath her she stared at the woman on the bed. The only sign of movement was the steady, rhythmic rise and fall of her chest. Then, her eye twitched. Standing up Rey walked next to the bed. Anna was still. “What the--,” there it was again. Anna’s eyes rolled beneath her lids erratically. “She’s dreaming,” a voice said behind her. She looked over her shoulder to find Finn standing in the doorway, “You aren’t going to the hearing?” He shook his head and walked over towards her, “Too many people.” With a sigh he stood on the opposite side of the bed and looked down at the helpless Jedi, “She’s just another person he’s hurt.” Rey grit her teeth, “She didn’t deserve this. I heard a doctor this morning, they aren’t sure she’ll ever wake up. Whatever he did to her---,” she glance up, “She trusted him, Finn, and he---.” “Hey, she’ll pull through.” “What if she doesn’t? We’re just going to leave her here? It’s worse than death, Finn.” Rey closed her eyes and turned back to the chair. “Rey---.” Finn stopped as a knock came from the door, “Come in,” he said. Poe stuck his head through BB-8 rolling into the room before him, “Hey, are you busy?” Rey waved her friend off, “No,” Finn said, “What’s up?” “We need you at the hearing, the council wants to hear your testimony.” Rey stood up, “Why? Finn wasn’t even there.” Poe nodded his head, “They’re reviewing everything to do with him, they’ll want to talk to you too eventually.” The girl turned to Finn, “You better go then.” Poe turned towards the door, and Finn laid a hand on Rey’s shoulder. “I’ll be back soon.” ***************************************** She’s standing in a room filled with other children. They’re filthy, covered in soot and sweat. Her body sways to and fro, as they stand on tired legs. A cloaked man stands at the front of the room. The head matron steps forward and begins to call names. The ranks around her begin to lessen as the children walk towards the man gathering around him. “…Kuro,” the matron yells. The girl’s eyes blink slowly. “Anna Kuro,” the woman calls again. Someone shoves her forward and she walks down the walkway, little eyes staring at her as she walks. They leave the room and filter into the hallway. The adults sit them down along the wall. Anna keeps her eyes on the cloaked man, and she realizes she’s staring back. She’s at the end of the line, she rests against the wall as the man takes the first boy into another room by hand. She doesn’t know how long she was asleep, but a foot keeps digging into her side. She looks up, half the line is gone, she doesn’t know where the other kids have gone. “Move up,” a voice hisses in her ear. She does as she is told. The door opens and a girl comes out with an apple, a big smile on her face. The matrons push her down the hall. Pretty soon there’s just one person left before her. Each child has come out with a piece of fruit, and big smiles. Her stomach rumbles and she hugs her belly. She’s alone sitting in the hallway, the head matron keeping an eye on her. The old woman taps her foot impatiently. Finally the door opens and a girl comes out with a peach. Anna scrambles to the door. It’s dark inside and she tries to squint through the darkness. “Close the door,” a voice whispers. She does as she is told. The door closes with a clack, and she turns around. “What’s your name?” She speaks quickly in the hopes that she’ll soon get a piece of food, “An-ro.” “An-ro? That’s an interesting name.” the voice has moved behind her, and she turns with it. It’s too dark to see though. She shakes her head, “Anna Kuro.” Her belly rumbles and she hold her hands to it trying to quiet the noises. “Are you hungry?” She nods her head, “Yes.” The rustling of fabric fills her senses, “Here.” Without a thought she reached out, as something round and smooth landed in her hands. Adrenaline rushed through her veins as she lifted the fruit of her lips and took a bite. Apple. The voice moved again to her right, “How old are you, Anna?” “Eight,” she said quickly as she devoured the apple. A light turned on and she covered her eyes. A shadow moved in front of the lamp, and moved towards her. She backed away, but the man crouched down and pulled down his hood. A man with a sandy blonde beard looked up at her. “My name is Luke, do you know why I’m here, Anna?” She shook her head. “I have a school. A special school for kids that are… different. I think you might be someone we’ve been looking for.” “How different?” she asked, cocking her head to the side. “You’re stronger and faster than the other kids are, aren’t you? And sometimes you know things are going to happen before they really do.” Anna clamped her mouth shut. Luke chuckled, “You don’t have to be afraid. I was like you too when I was little.” “Really?” A hand ruffled her hair, “Yes, really. You can go with me, Anna, to the school. We’ll teach you how to read and a lot of other things. Would you like that?” The little girl nodded her head. The man stood up and picked up a bag, “I’ll go talk to the head matron.” He turned around and motioned for her to follow him. She stared at the bag in his hands. “What’s the matter?” he asked. She swallowed and looked up at him, “Can I have some more?” He laughed and reached into the bag, a green pear came out and her tossed it to her, “Alright, Anna, let’s go.” ********************************************** “What happened next?” the board lietuinant asked. Finn grit his teeth and leaned forward and spoke into the microphone. “He--- killed Han Solo.” The crowd gasped and Leia bit her lip her eyes boring into Ben’s back. Finn continued, “We couldn’t hear anything, but after Han fell, Chewbacca was able to shoot him in his side. Then we ran.” “You keep referring to your attacker as “he”. Do you see him in this room?” a Councilor asked to his right. Finn took a deep breath and pointed to the right of the room, “Ben Solo, Kylo Ren, whatever you want to call him. He’s the one who attacked us.” “So you fought with him?” Finn nodded. “For a few minutes. We were able to injure one another, before I tried to run. That’s when he got me in the back.” “He stabbed you?” “No. He sliced down my back with his lightsaber.” “Would you be willing to show us your scar?” the lieutenant asked. Finn gave a nod and stood up slowly. He turned his back on the audience, and took a deep breath. Then, he reached for the hem of his shirt. Slowly he pulled up the back of his shirt, revealing a long jagged scar running from his shoulder, all the way down until it disappeared beneath the waist of his pants. Leia closed her eyes as the audience went silent. Ben stared straight at Finn’s back, his face impassive. “Thank you,” Mon Mothma said quietly, “You may step down.” Finn pulled down his shirt and quickly made his way out of the room. Mothma looked at the clock, and picked up her papers, “Today’s hearing is adjourned. We will reconvene tomorrow morning.” She glanced over at Ben, “The prisoner’s testimony will be heard during those proceedings.” With that the council left the room. The guards surrounded ben’s chair and pulled him up. Leia stood from her seat, and Luke grabbed her by the elbow. “Not now,” he whispered. She looked back and watched as Ben was escorted from the room. His eyes were downcast as he disappeared. Shaking out of Luke’s hold, Leia walked down the steps. “General?” Ara’ve asked, looking up to find her suddenly next to him. “I demand to speak with my son,” she said, her voice low and level. “I’m afraid I cannot meet your request at this time,” he answered. “You’ve kept him under lock and key for six weeks, Captain, and for the past three, I have been kept from seeing him,” she growled out, “Just let me speak with him.” Luke stepped forward, “If it’s a security risk you’re worried about, I will gladly accompany her.” The Quarren shook his head, “I’m sorry, but even with your authority, ma’am we can’t afford another incident." He shook his head and sighed, "You are not doing your son any favors, by protecting him.” With that said he walked off. “Son of a bitch,” Leia hissed under her breath. “Leia,” Luke sighed. “What?” “Calm yourself, they can’t keep this up forever.” “He’s my son, Luke,” she said, her eyes filled with pain. “I know. I’ll speak with the Captain again. She shook her head, and took off up the stairs. Luke stayed behind until the atrium was empty. “We just need to keep trying,” he said as he left the room behind. Notes: So I wanted to see how a trial scene might go because I think that the members of the resistance would want justice. Fortunately if you found this chapter boring, it's really only going to continue for one more chapter or so. Have a nice night!-Mahana Chapter 19 : BOOK II:GREY AREA Summary: So, I am exhausted. Here's the newest chapter. Let me know what you think! Ben & Anna scenes will be coming your way soon! Notes: Just want to start off with how astounded I am at the response I've gotten about this fic. I looked at the story stats and saw that 50 people are subscribed. That may not sound like a lot but to me that means that fifty people out there like this story enough they want to see annoying emails telling them that my story ha s updated. I'm excited to keep writing and getting more feedback. You guys are AWESOME!!!! Love ya'll--- Mahana Leia took her seat next to Luke, who glanced at her, “You look…” he began. “Like crap?” she asked, raising an eyebrow at him, “Yeah, I know.” Captain Ara’ve walked by them without a word and took his seat several rows below them. Luke shifted in his seat and leaned next to her ear, “He said he’d consider letting you see Ben, after today’s hearing.” Leia looked at her brother in disbelief, “How did you persuade him?” “It’ll be short, and I’ll have to be there, along with an armed guard.” “He won’t hurt me, Luke.” “Yeah, I’m sure that’s what Han---,” Luke cut himself off as Leia looked away, “I’m sorry.” She sighed, and rubbed her palms on her thighs repeatedly, “No, you’re right, but something doesn’t feel right about this. I wish Anna was here. We need her.” Everyone in the audience stood as the council entered the room. A few seconds later the guards escorted Ben into the room. Everyone was silent as they tied him to the witness chair in front of the room. His eyes scanned the room around him, hundreds of faces staring back at him. Leia caught his gaze and he looked to the empty seat next to her, questioning. She shook her head at him, knowing exactly who he was searching for. She’s not here, sweetheart. Ben nodded his head, his face looking relieved and calm for the first time since the hearing had begun. Leia frowned at his reaction. A councilman cleared his throat and nodded to the board’s lieutenant. The man gave a stiff nod and spoke to Ben, “Please state your name, for the record.” The prisoner stared at the floor, his hands clenching into fists. He was silent. The officer asked him again, “What is your name?” Brown steely eyes glanced up to the audience. His face was hardened and his jaw was set. He took a short breath before he growled out, “Kylo Ren.” Leia frowned at the pain in his voice. Luke moved to the edge of his seat, his brow furrowing. Leia held a hand in front of her mouth as several gasps echoed from around the chamber. The court officer moved closer to the witness’ chair, “Kylo Ren. Is that your real name?” he asked. “It’s what those under my command know me by.” “Are any of those men here today?” the officer asked. “No.” “Then what is your real name? Your birth name?” A low voice answered the man, “ That is not my name.” “Hmmm, well I’ll just call you Kylo, then. Can I call you Kylo?” The officer turned back to his desk, “What I have here, is a record of your birth. Ben Solo, son of General’s Leia Organa and Han Solo.” Leia fought to not fidget in her seat as almost all eyes turned to her. Instead she kept her eyes forward, watching over her son. The lieutenant continued, “At the age of nine you were sent to the Jedi Academy to learn the ways of the new order. All reports of your time there are exemplary, until you exited the program as a Jedi Knight and were captured on your first solo mission.” Setting the file back on the desk the officer paced in front of him, “ Kylo , would you please tell us what happened during your time as a prisoner of the First Order?” “You’ve summarized most of my life already, why stop now?” “Please answer the question.” The dark haired man, shifted in his seat, his movements hindered by the restraints on his arms, ankles, and neck. “I learned,” he spat out, “I learned that to be strong you have to take what you want.” “You were tortured.” Kylo strained against the restraints the metal biting into his skin, as he leaned forward, “I was instructed.” “Were you ordered to attack your allies? Your fellow students, friends, even your own family, slaughtered like animals, many by your hand,” the officer turned around and gestured to the top row where Luke and Leia sat. All eyes turned on them once more. “I did as I pleased.” The room was silent. “Is that what happened the night you killed Kyle Mercor?” “He was in my way.” “So you admit, that you killed him?” “Yes.” “How about Commander Kuro?” His jaw clenched and he cleared his throat, “What about her?” “You tell me, was she helping you? I have reports. The two of you were close, and considering you abducted her, it would make perfect sense if she was trying to help you escape.” “No,” he said loudly, his voice slightly urgent. The prisoner looked down his hands holding onto the chair so hard his knuckles had turned white, “No, she tried to stop me. She begged me to let the guard go, but I---I lost control. She wouldn’t stop yelling…” He went silent. The room stared at him waiting for him to continue. Clearing his throat for the fifth time, the court officer, stepped closer, “Does that happen often? You lose control, hurt people who upset you?” “I’m not a child, I---.” The Force user’s eyes drifted up to the top of the stairs as the door opened. The lieutenant followed his line of sight, “Kylo?” The man ignored him, and watched as a lithe figure came through the doorway. Rey looked down on him before turning to the left. She walked next to Leia’s chair and bent down whispering something in her ear. Leia looked up at her confused. Mon Mothma cleared her throat, “Is everything alright, General?” Leia stood up and followed Rey out the door without a word. Several whispers flew through the crowd and the council chairwoman banged a gavel, “Quiet, please.” The lieutenant looked around the room, “Perhaps we should take a break?” The council members looked at one another, and gave some nods, “We’ll reconvene this afternoon.” ********************************************** Leia ran behind Rey down the hallway, taking every turn as quickly as her body could stand it. When they reached the med bay she leaned against the wall and huffed, struggling to catch her breath. Rey looked at her warily, “She was really upset, I’m not sure she was very lucid. She asked me where he was, and how long she’d been asleep--- when I told her, she just started trying to run down the hall.” The old General gave a nod, “Just take me inside.” The scent of chemicals met her as they walked through the doorway. Leia sighed as the med droid moved away from the bed. Pale, skinny, and wide-eyed, Anna sat with her arms hugging herself, and her legs hanging off the side of the bed. Rey stayed by the door, as the older woman walked to the side of the bed, “Anna?” she asked. The girl looked up at her, eyes brimming with tears, “Leia,” she wrapped her arms around the woman and hugged her tightly, causing Leia to let out a gasp. “I’m so sorry,” the girl whispered. Leia grasped the girl by the arms, and bent down, pushing the hair out of Anna’s face, “Why would you be sorry?” “Ben---,” the young woman began, but Leia cut her off “Rey told you about the guard and the hearing?” Anna gave a small nod and Leia pulled her into another hug, and rubbed her back. “I’m the one who is sorry, my sweet girl. I should have never let you go in there by yourself, I just--- I was sure he wouldn’t hurt you.” Anna’s shoulder shook as she sobbed into the old woman’s shoulder, Leia held her tightly, “Shhhh, it’s alright.” “No,” Anna cried out, “It’s not. B-Ben didn’t hurt me.” Rey stepped next to Leia frowning, “What do you mean?” Leia straightened up and looked at Anna, who began to shake, “I- Ben didn’t---he didn’t kill the guard,” she whispered. Letting the girl go, Leia stood in shock, “Then who did?” she asked her voice going hoarse. Anna looked up at her, eyes swollen and her face white as a sheet, “I did.” Leia’s breath caught in her throat and her heart threatened to jump out of her chest. The door opened with a hiss, “Hey, look who’s awake---,” Luke said coming into the room. Leia looked at him and he close his mouth instantly. Anna bent over and held her head in her hands, “I’m sorry,” she began to repeat as she rocked back and forth. Leia grabbed Rey by the arm and went to the door. She turned to the girl, “Watch her. No one is to come in or out of here.” She turned to the door to leave, but not before she turned around once more and grabbed Rey roughly by the shoulder, “Do not repeat any of this to anyone. Do you understand?” The girl gave a sharp nod, “Yes, ma’am.” With that Leia left the med bay, with Luke in tow. ********************************** “Where are we going?” Luke asked as they sped through the corridors. “I need to see Ben.” “Leia,” Luke said, grabbing her by the arm, “they’re not going to let you see him right now.” “Oh, yes they will.” Luke looked at her in confusion, “What’s wrong?” “Everything.” Without any further explanation, she took off down the hall. Soon they came to a stop at the guard office. The man at the door, was just taking a drink of coffee. He took a gulp of the hot liquid just as they walked around the corner. Spluttering he put the mug down on the table as quickly as possible, and gave a sloppy salute, “General,” he exclaimed. Leia gave a nod. “What can I do for you ma’am?” he asked. “I need to see my son.” He looked to the side sheepishly, “I---.” “I’ll take it from her private.” The twins turned around. “Captain,” Luke said with a nod. “I thought we had an agreement, Master Skywalker. No visitors until after the hearing.” Leia spoke before Luke could, “It’s urgent, just let me speak with him.” Ara’ve shook his head, “The hearing is about to start soon, and my security team isn’t assembled. You’re just putting the people of this base and yourselves at risk.” “It’s important I speak with him before the hearing. I won’t be long. Please, Captain,” Leia said stepping forward. Luke stood behind her in support. Ara’ve looked at the two of them and sighed, “Five minutes, then I’m shutting it down.” He motioned to a guard, “Walk her to the prisoner’s chamber.” “Yes, sir,” the guard replied, he turned to Leia, “Follow me, ma’am.” Luke stayed behind watching her carefully. They came to a door, “We’ll be listening, and guards will be stationed out here,” the man sad before he opened the door. Leia took a deep breath and stepped inside. “You’re early,” a dark figure said turning around. He stopped, “What are you doing here?” “Shush,” Leia said walking up to him. She looked down at his arms his long sleeves rolled back. Bruises and open gashes marred his skin. Leia glanced up into his eyes, “Ben...” “The guards are not kind to the person that killed one of their own,” he said grimly. Leia reached up and cupped his face between her palms. He froze and stared down at her, letting out a shaky breath. “Anna woke up an hour ago,” she said, searching his eyes, “She said…things.” The young man slipped away from her hands and turned away, one hand over his mouth, the other crossed over his chest, “Is she alright?” he asked over his shoulder. Leia’s shoulders fell, “Oh, Ben.” She looked down and shook her head, blurring her eyes, “It’s true isn’t it? She---.” “Shut up,” he hissed urgently, spinning and pushing his face in front of hers. She gasped and took a step back. His face fell, and he turned back around. “It was my fault. She doesn’t deserve this.” “Neither do you, Ben,” she breathed painfully, as tears fell down her face. The door opened behind her, “Time’s up.” Leia stared at the back of her son, and wiped her face. Slowly she turned around. “Mom?” She froze. She glanced over her shoulder, brown eyes staring at her, “Yes?” she whispered. “She---It was an accident.” He shook his head, “Just… keep Anna safe… please?” Leia looked down as the guard shifted by the door. Slowly she looked up and gave him a nod, “Alright.” Turning around she stepped out of the cell. The door slammed behind her, leaving her only son in the dark. *********************************************************** Leia and Luke walked silently down the hallway. As they turned the corner, Luke pushed her into a side room, “What the hell, Luke?” she yelled. He glanced at her, “What’s going on?” he asked, looking at her with a grim face. She looked away, and kicked at a rolled up piece of paper on the floor. Luke waited for a moment, “Leia, tell me.” She shook her head, “Ben didn’t kill the guard.” Luke frowned, “What does that mean? He had to the only other person there was…” he trailed off as realization hit him, “Anna?” Leia nodded her head. “But why?” Luke asked beginning to pace back and forth, “Why would she do that?” “I don’t know. Ben said it was an accident.” “He has to be lying,” her brother said. She looked straight at him, “Luke.” He blocked her out, “No, she wouldn’t. She couldn’t. The guard died from a Force attack. Anna was weak---.” “Luke.” The man kept pacing, trying to find a solution, “Aside from that, we talked about it: I couldn’t sense her anywhere in the Force. She was powerless.” “Luke, will you please---?” “You have to be wrong.” Leia grabbed ahold of him, “Luke, listen to me. Ben wasn’t the one who told me,” she said, her voice beginning to shake, “Anna did.” ************************************************* She stood with her back straight, and stared out the window silently. Her clothes were clean and pressed, her hair washed and brushed back. From the outside looking in, she was calm, and orderly, but that was only the exterior. Rey stood by the door watching her. Ever since Master Skywalker and the general had left, Anna had been silent. She had taken a shower and brushed her hair without a word. Rey was unsure what to think of the Jedi. Here was a woman she had trusted, and looked up to. Seeing Anna shaken up like this, it was unnerving. The door opened, and Rey moved to block the entrance. Her shoulders relaxed as Luke walked in. She looked at him hopefully. He stared past her at the woman behind us. “Rey, leave us.” His tone was harsh and guttural. She gave a nod and exited the room. Luke watched the girl leave then turned back to his student. “Is it true?” he asked. She was wordless and still. The old Jedi’s hands clenched into fists at his sides, “Damnit, Anna, is it true?” he spat. The room was silent for a moment, then her reply came swift and short, quieter than a whisper, but loud enough to deafen him, “Yes.” Luke looked away, as she turned around, “I lost control.” Tears poured from her eyes. The wet orbs, sliding down her face took him aback. In all the time he had known her, taught her, and raised her, the girl before him had only cried once. The day the Academy was destroyed. Without his permission, his feet carried him across the room, until he was standing right in front of her. She looked away from him, the shame rolling off of her. Tenderly, he pulled her to him, and she buried her face in his chest, “I’m so sorry,” she sobbed. Her hands gripped his robes, and she looked up at him pleading, “Please, master, help me. I’m so scared…” she gasped for breath, “ Hah --- I-I don’t know what to do.” Her words turned to sobs and she leaned against him, her sobs drifting throughout the room. Luke stroked her head, “I know, young one, I know.” ***************************************************************** Leia and Luke sat in her quarters. Quickly he relayed Anna’s account of the night the guard was killed. “She can’t tell them, Leia. It was an accident, but the Resistance? They’re out for blood. The council will think she was trying to help Ben escape, and they’ll crucify her right alongside him.” “I know,” Leia said. Luke glanced at her in shock. She leaned forward in her seat, “It’s her word against his. Everyone knows they're involved. If she confesses, they’ll just think she’s trying to protect him.” “And they’ll see her as siding with the enemy.” ***************************************** Anna, Leia, and Luke sat around the room. “I have to tell them,” Anna whispered. Luke and Leia looked at one another, “You can’t,” Luke said. The girl stood up and pointed to the door, “I killed a man---,” her voice hitched, “An innocent man.” “And it was an accident,” Leia said, “We know. But you stomping into that hearing, and proclaiming your guilt will not be doing anyone, any favors.” “So, I let Ben take the fall?” Anna hissed. Luke stood up, “You let us handle it.” “They’re going to kill him, Luke,” she whispered. Leia stood next to her brother, “Not if we can help it.” Chapter 20 : BOOK II : GREY AREA Notes: If you're not busy... Comments and kudos make me happy!!! (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) The halls were silent as she slinked through the darkness. Her feet carried her lightly, attracting no attention, the only sound was the soft rustling of her cloak as her hips swayed back and forth. Without a word she passed by the guard post. “Hey, you can’t be here---.” She waved a hand, “You will sit down and give me the passcode.” The man straightened his back, and spoke in monotone, “I will sit down and give you the passcode.” “Forget that I am here.” The man stared at her blankly. She took a step forward, and opened the door with the code. She stepped through the entrance, “Go to sleep.” The second the words left her lips, the man’s head fell forward, and he began to snore. Closing the door behind her she walked down the line of cells. Coming to the one at the end she input the code. The door opened with a hiss. A figure in the corner stood up and walked towards her. “Anna?” She pulled back her hood and ran to him. Just as her fingers grazed his arm, he collapsed. “Ben,” she whispered as she caught ahold of him. Slowly she lowered him to the floor. He looked up at her, his eyes shining in the moonlight. She looked down at him, bruised and beaten. “What did they do to you?” she whispered. A cold hand cupped her cheek and she looked back up at him. “I’m alright,” he said, “I’m alright, but- what are you doing here?” She looked back at the door, “I’m getting you out of here.” “No.” Anna looked back at him wide-eyed. “What do you mean, ‘No’?” “I can’t let you do this, not for me,” he said staring up at her. “Don’t do this, Ben, it’s my fault. I killed him not you---.” He cut her off, by pressing cold fingers over her mouth, “Sssh. You’ve done so much for me, and you wouldn’t have been there I hadn’t---,” he looked off to the side and sighed, “I’ve made my choice, Anna.” She pried his fingers off of her mouth, “I’ve chosen too. I’m not leaving you here…” Her eyes began to tear up, “You’ll die, Ben.” “I’m okay with that.” Anna pushed him away, “No. This is bullshit.” She turned away from him and stood. Her hands shielded her face as she paced back and forth. With a silent groan he rose from the concrete floor and walked up to her, catching her by the arm. She glanced at him, trying to stifle her sobs. With a tug, he pulled her to him, letting her bury her face in his chest. His arms wrapped around her holding her close, and he pressed his lips against her forehead. She shook her head, “We can leave, go away, somewhere they’ll never find us.” Anna wrapped her arms around him, “I’m so tired of this, Ben.” His fingers slipped beneath her chin, and he tilted her head back. Brown eyes met with blue, and he took a deep breath. He stared deep into her eyes, focusing on the gold flecks that highlighted the color. Ben shook his head and spoke slowly, his voice just a breath above a whisper, “I would do anything to be with you. I love you.” He looked away and chuffed as his eyes watered, “And I lost sight of that---somehow. I lost sight of you.” His hands roved down to her shoulders, and he held her by the arms, “But you found me. Anna, you helped---.” He swallowed and grimaced, his long locks falling over his brow, “I’m me again.” “Just come with me, Ben,” she whispered taking him by the hand, but he escaped her grasp. “I. Can’t.” “Why not!” she shouted. Her voice echoed off the metal walls as she stepped towards him, “Why are you doing this now?” “I’m trying to protect you!” She shook her head, and grit her teeth, “I don’t need your protection,” she hissed, “They can do what they want to me.” He looked away, “I’m not worried about them. It’s me, Anna. I’m scared of what I will do to you. I’ve hurt you too many times. How long before I--- at some point it will go too far.” Anna stared at the floor her mouth hanging open slightly, “Ben, if you’re asking me to pick between them and you,” she bit the inside of her cheek and pursed her lips pointing at the cell doorway, “I will choose you. I have always chosen you.” He looked down at her, “Maybe that’s the problem,” he whispered. Smack! A hard hand slapped him across his face leaving a red mark across his cheek. He looked back at her silently. Blue eyes seethed in the darkness, “How can you say that?” she whispered, tears flowing down her cheeks, “How can you even think that?” She turned towards the door ready to flee but he caught ahold of her, “Don’t go. Not yet. Please.” She froze, he breath caught in her throat. “I didn’t say it to hurt you. I just--- I think about all the times you’ve been there. Even when I--- I hurt people, when I hurt you. You found a way to balance it out.” Her body relaxed as he spoke, “You make me feel rooted, connected. I look at you and I feel---.” “I can’t lose you again, Ben. I can’t just stand by and watch you die.” She turned around, “That’s what they are going to do tomorrow, Ben. Luke and your mother, they say that they’re going to help, but they can’t. It’s impossible.” A loud banging sound came from the corridor, and they both jumped as though they’d been electrocuted. Footsteps echoed and the light of a flashlight, reflected off the glass of a window across the hallway. Anna covered her eyes, as the guard from before came into view, shining his light around the room, “What the---.” The guard began to reach for his communicator, but Anna threw her hand at him. His movement stopped as his body froze. Ben stepped behind her as a low hum filled his senses. “Anna, don’t do this,” he whispered. She ignored him, and focused on the guard, “You will return to your desk, and forget you saw us.” Ben’s eyes went wide as the guard repeated her instructions. How can she do that? She should be powerless, her connection is severed. I can feel it. Anna released her hold on the man, and watched as he began to close the door, but she stopped him, “And you will leave the cell door open.” A monotone voice was the man’s reply, “I will leave the cell door open.” With that he walked back down the hall. Anna turned back to Ben, “How did you do that?” he asked, warily. She frowned and shook her head, “What do you mean? It’s just a simple mind trick.” Ben froze. She doesn’t know, he thought. Anna stepped up to him, “Ben, what’s wrong?” He shook his head, and looked up at the skylight over-head. Rays of sunlight began to trickle in through the porthole. He panicked. “You have to leave.” He said taking her by the arm, “Before they realize you’re here.” She dug her feet in and grabbed his wrist, “What about you?” He shook his head, “You said Luke has a plan?” Anna shook her head, “That’s what he said, but I---.” She looked down the hall as another creaking sound echoed off the metal walls, “I don’t think---mmmm!” Ben cut her off, as his lips crashed into hers. She stared at him in shock as he kissed her, hard, as though it was their last time. She clamped her eyes shut, as she realized: it could be their last time. One of his hands cupped her cheek, and held her closer to him. Then, he pushed her away. “Go,” he ordered, stepping back inside his cell. “Ben…” He held out his hand and used the Force to press on the door console. She stepped towards him, but he shook his head as the cell door slid shut sealing him in the dark, “I love you.” Notes: Sooooooooooooooooooooooooo, no chapter tomorrow, as I will be in classes all day. Yuck :( This chapter is short, because I woke up with a stomach bug this morning. Hopefully, tomorrow will be better. My brother, who is a bigger SW nerd than I am, has been helping me figure some things out and he read the past few couple of chapters: (From now on, Nay-Nay, is my brother since I will probably talk more about him. Yes, that is his actual nickname). Nay-Nay: “You know, for someone Luke describes as ‘never crying’, Anna sure is crying a lot.” I thought about it for a minute: “Well, she’s under a lot of stress.” Nay-Nay: “Is she going to stop crying soon?” I thought for a few more minutes: “If I’m feeling less sadistic? Maybe.” Nay-Nay: “You should make Ben cry. Women love men who cry.” I glanced at him: “How do you know that?” He literally took a bite of his sandwich and mumbled in a George Takai voice and wiggled his head, “I read.” (So, that’s why Ben gets a little teary eyed in this chapter.) Chapter 21 : BOOK II : GREY AREA; Makayla's Chapter 1/2 Notes: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The story may not be as long as you were hoping, but I am currently working on the next chapter (It needed to be split up to satisfy my need for suspense) and I will publish it before midnight my time (Alaska time, so wherever you are take the time difference into account). I hope you had a wonderful day and thanks for reading! (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) The base was still silent by the time she made it back to her room. Anna pulled back her hood, and ran her fingers through her hair with a sigh, as she pushed the door open. She stepped inside, and closed the door behind her. Click. Anna covered her eyes as someone turned on her lamp. Squinting she looked around the room, three pairs of eyes staring back at her. Rey stood by the window, and Leia looked at her from the couch. Luke leaned against the end of the bed, his arms crossed over his chest, “Where were you?” he asked softly. She walked over to the sink, and turned on the faucet, “Stretching my legs,” she said, as she ran her fingers beneath the frigid stream of water. Pulling her hair back, she splashed her face and reached for a towel. “We told you to let us handle it, Anna.” “Well, you got your wish, Luke,” she said turning the water off and drying her face off. Rey stepped forward, “What does that mean?” Anna glanced at the girl for a moment, and ignoring her question, she turned back to the man by the bed, “What’s your plan?” she asked. Leia stood up, “He doesn’t have one yet,” she said, looking at her brother, “We’ve spent the night silently searching for you.” Anna moved past the woman and shrugged off her robes. She laid it on the bed, standing in only a tunic and leggings as she kicked her boots off, “I can take care of myself.” Reaching down she undid her belt. A pale, wrinkled hand caught hers. She looked up into another set of blue eyes. “You saw him,” Luke said. It was not a question. She yanked herself out of his grasp, and turned away, “How astute of you, master. ” “Hey,” he said grabbing her again by the shoulder. She glared at him, and he noticed that the skin around her eyes was red and puffy. He shook his head, “You’re angry. I understand---.” “ You understand?” she hissed pushing him away from her. She looked at the other two people in the room, looking at her disapprovingly. Her eyes burned as she stepped away from Luke, “Just get out.” “Anna, calm down,” Luke said, “You have to trust me.” Her body tensed, like she was standing on shards of glass. She spoke over her shoulder, her voice low, “I did trust you--- for fourteen years.” Slowly she turned around, “Look where that got us.” Leia shook her head, and stepped next to her brother, “Luke’s not the one who killed the guard. You think you’re the only one who wants to help Ben? He’s my son, Anna.” The young woman pointed at Luke, “And you think he wants to help? I can feel what he feels, Leia. All those lessons on control,” Anna moving her face closer to Luke’s, “All the lectures on burying your emotions, and every time you, ” she said poking him in the chest, “ Even think of Ben—every time you look at him, you only see your failure.” Luke stared at her, his face filling with pain, “You don’t want to save him. You never did---.” “Enough.” Leia stepped between them, forcing them apart. Luke turned away avoiding her gaze, so she turned to Anna, “You’re tired, and you’re letting the stress get to you.” The girl shook her head, and pointed at Luke, “Ask him, Leia. Ask him why we spent the past three years chasing down fairytales.” Leia turned to her brother, and stopped him from speaking back, “Just go. It’s late.” Luke looked past her at Anna, who turned away, avoiding his gaze. Clenching his jaw he walked to the door and waited for his sister to follow him. Rey sat down on the bed, “I’ll stay,” she said. Leia looked at her with a sigh. “Are you sure?” Rey shrugged and laid back on the bed. Leia turned back to Anna, “We’ll come find you before sentencing.” She looked at the window, sunlight beginning to shine through the blinds, “Get some sleep, it won’t be until this afternoon.” Anna ignored her and walked into the bathroom, slamming the door behind her. “She’ll calm down,” Rey said sheepishly, glancing at the general. “I think--- I think she feels helpless.” Leia grit her teeth, “She isn’t the only one.” Turning around she and Luke walked out the door. ************************************************* Anna slammed the door behind her and stood still. The room was sterile white, with a stainless steel sink and toilet. Her heart was racing and the sobs she thought were finally gone, were beginning to jump in her throat. Standing up, she walked over to the shower and turned the water on. Steam began to rise and fill the bathroom. Pulling her hair over her shoulder, she leaned against the sink and looked in the mirror. What am I doing? She asked herself, her hands balled up into fists and she looked down, her breathing becoming stuttered. She leaned down and pressed her forehead against the cool metal of the sink, and closed her eyes, fighting to keep control of the tears that threatened to spill forth. Damn it. She slammed her fist down on the counter as anger and something else boiled in her stomach. Anna stood straight, as a wave of nausea washed over her. She clamped a hand over her mouth and gagged before running to the toilet in the corner of the room. She pushed up the lid and did her best to pull her hair back before she puked. Her coughs and heaves echoed loudly off the walls. A few seconds into throwing up her guts, the door handle rattled behind her and Rey’s voice came through. “Anna, are you alright?” She leaned against the toilet, and panted, a sour taste in her mouth, “I’m fine,” she said pitifully. Rey knocked on the door again, not hearing reply. Anna stood up and turned off the water, “I’m fine, Rey.” The girl said nothing, but Anna could hear her footsteps retreating from the bathroom. With a shaky breath she sunk down to the floor, her mind racing and her hands shaking. ******************************************************* “She didn’t mean that, Luke,” Leia said as she walked behind him down the hallway. His eyes remained focused on the floor, “Yes she did.” He stopped. Leia came to a halt next to him, and laid a hand on his shoulder. Her brow furrowed as she looked up at him in concern. Luke shook his hand and continued down the hallway without her. “Where are you going?” she called after him. He glanced back at her, before taking a hard left, “To see my nephew.” ******************************************************* Anna wrapped a towel around herself as she stepped out of the shower. Water dripped from her hair as she walked over to the mirror. The shower had helped her body relax and the tremors had ceased. Looking up she reached towards the mirror, to wipe away at the foggy surface. The moment her fingers grazed the smooth glass, she let out a gasp as her eyes rolled back in her head. Visions and voices flew through her mind. “She can’t know. The plan hinges on her reaction.” Elegant and green, a palace of towers and waterfalls, rising up into the sky. “Queen Andola wishes to speak with you.” “I’m useless now. I can’t help you, I’m not even sure I can handle this.” “You aren’t alone anymore. Stay with me.” Anna stumbled back staring at her face in the mirror, her eyes wide. She looked down. Her hands were shaking. Again. Gripping her hands together, she wiped her eyes and ran from the room. In a whirl of wet hair and feet she closed the door behind her and leaned against it. “Are you alright?” Anna looked up. Rey was sitting on the bed reading through files Luke had left behind. A plate of crackers and fruit sat on the table beside her. Rey looked at the food, “I thought you might be hungry.” “Maybe later,” Anna answered pressing a palm against her stomach. The threat of vomiting again was still there. Wiping her nose she went to the dresser and took out some clothes, choosing a blue shirt and black pants. She stepped back into the bathroom and pulled on the garments. With a sigh she walked back into the bedroom using a towel to dry her hair. Silently she went to the chair beside the window and sat down, curling her legs up beneath her. Anna stopped drying her hair and looked at Rey sadly, “What?” Rey asked, with a frown. The woman bit her lip and looked away, “Nothing,” she said, as she leaned back in the chair and turning to the window. The sun was just beginning to peek over the mountain tops and the sky was a bright swirl of pink and orange. Rey shook her head, and pushed herself off the bed. “Why did you do it?” Anna hung her head, “Rey…” “Don’t “Rey” me,” the girl said, “I need to know. Why did you kill him?” “I don’t know.” Anna let out a shaky breath and turned around so she was leaning against the back of the chair on her side. Her fingers stroked the black leather arm of the chair, “There’s a reason I pressed you to learn to control yourself. There’s no emotion, at least there shouldn’t be, but I---I lost control, Rey.” She ran fingers through her hair and tilted her head back as she closed her eyes, “I can feel it, you know? You’re disappointment, disapproval.” Lightening blue eyes, opened to stare at the girl, “Learn from my mistakes, Rey. I tried to tell you, your powers make you dangerous.” She chuckled, “Maybe I should have taken my own advice.” ***************************************************** “What do you mean you’re not letting us inside?” Leia asked, at the head of the mob trying to get into the auditorium. Anna stood behind her silently, scowling at the man with her arms crossed. She hadn’t said a word since Leia had come to get her. The guard looked at the crowd, beads of sweat breaking out over his forehead, “I’m sorry, but the hearing has been closed to everyone except key personnel for sentencing.” “On whose order?” Anna asked, letting her arms fall to her side as she shifted from one foot to the other. “The Council’s,” he replied. “Leia!” The two women turned around to find Luke pushing his way through the crowd, “What’s going on?” he asked. “They’re not letting us in Luke.” The guard coughed, “Master Skywalker, the Council is waiting for you to begin.” Luke nodded to Leia, “They’re both with me.” “I’m sorry, sir. I can only let people with the proper clearance, into the atrium.” Luke glanced at his companions. Leia shrugged her shoulders and Anna stared back at him blankly. “I’m sorry,” he said. He turned to go with the guard but Leia caught him by the arm. “Please tell me you have a plan,” she whispered He looked at the door in front of them, “One, but,” he glanced back at Anna, “You aren’t going to like it.” *************************************************************** Anna sat on a bench as Leia paced back and forth in front of her, “I hate waiting,” the older woman hissed. “Hmmm,” Anna said as she stared at the floor, leaning on one hand with her chin. Leia came to a stop and sat down next to her, with a sigh. She glanced at the girl next to her, “You know Anna…” she stopped as Anna let her hand fall, and hung her head, staring at the ground between her feet. Leia laid a hand on the girl’s back and scooted closer to her, “Whatever happens in there,” she whispered in Anna’s ear, “None of this is your responsibility.” Anna glanced up at the door, “Your son is in there facing a death sentence, because of me. Try telling me that I have no reason to feel guilty when we go to his execution.” Standing up, she walked off and stood by the door. Leia closed her eyes and sighed. All that was left was to wait. ************************************** Leia looked at her watch, They’ve been in there for two hours, how long is this going to take? The sound of the large doors to the atrium opening answered her question. As quickly as she could, she stood from her seat, and waited as Luke walked out of the room. He avoided her gaze, held his hand out to her and walked over to Anna, who stood closest to the door. Blood drummed in Leia’s ears, deafening her as she watched them with trepidation. Luke stood with his back to her, and Anna’s face was impassive. The girl’s body tensed. Raising his hand, Luke reached out to her, trying to lay a hand on her shoulder. Anna pushed his hand away and turned down the hall, taking off in a sprint. Leia’s heart fell as she watched the girl flee. She turned back to Luke, to find him staring at her. That’s when she crumbled. Raising a hand to her lips she bent over, stifling her cries. Strong arms wrapped themselves around her, pulling her into a solid embrace. She buried her face in Luke’s shoulder and sobbed, “Ben…” ************************************* “I’m sorry, Anna. I swear I tried, but they wouldn’t listen. The execution is set for the day after tomorrow.” She had nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide, and that’s what she wanted most right now. No, that was wrong. She wanted Ben. “Commander Kuro?” Poe asked as she ran by the cafeteria. She ignored him and hurried down the hall, red faced. Voices of curiosity and disdain followed her down the corridor as she ran. “Is she alright?” “Must have heard the verdict.” “I heard they were close, then he tried to kill her. You’d think she’d want him dead just as much as the rest of us.” “Maybe he brainwashed her? She was a prisoner all that time.” Anna pushed past the people and finally made it to her room. Stepping inside she threw the door closed and ran to the bed, tears streaming down her cheeks. With a thud she fell to her knees at the side of the bed, burying her face in the sheets. She could hear someone trying to open the door, but she threw her hand in the air, and forced it closed, “Go away,” she yelled. Footsteps retreated from the door, and she slumped on the floor. This is my fault, her mind whispered, I have to do something, I can’t let this happen. “Anna?” Rey’s voice called from the door. Anna looked over seeing the girl’s silhouette through the opaque glass. “Just go away,” she whispered putting her hands over her ears. Another knock came from the door, “Leave me alone!” “Anna the doctors need to run some tests.” They want to test me now? She would have laughed if she only had the breath to do so. Anna pulled herself up and sat on the bed. Her hands fisted the sheets and she steeled herself. The door opened slowly, and a med droid came into the room. Rey poked her head inside the door, but retreated when Anna’s eyes caught hers. The droid came to a stop in front of her and an automated voice spoke to her. “Hello, I am ICUP-2, I have been tasked with taking a blood test.” Anna cut him off and held out her arm. A long needle moved towards her before piercing her skin. “Please wait. The results will be concluded in one moment.” The droid pulled back and gave her a bandage. Anna pressed the cloth to her arm to stop the bleeding. “You tested me two days ago.” “Results were inconclusive. It was deemed necessary to reevaluate your condition.” Anna stood up, and wiped her face, “Condition?” The droid turned back to her, but she blocked out his next two words, as her heart and soul crumbled to dust. Notes: Also, droid names are hard to come up with, if anyone noticed my childish naming of the med droid in Anna's last scene. Where will we go from here? Chapter 22 : BOOK II : GREY AREA; Makayla's Chapter 2/2 Notes: Here's your second chapter, Makayla! I hope you enjoy it. (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) Anna sat on the bed staring into space, as the med droid left the room. I need to leave, I need to go. Standing up she, went to the footlocker on the other side of the bedroom and took out her things. Grabbing one of Rey’s bags she emptied its contents on the bed, and stuffed her belongings inside. No lightsaber… Anna grit her teeth as she tied the bag closed and swung it over her shoulder. Walking over to the bed she grabbed her wrist band and slipped it onto her arm. A familiar green light glowed up at her and she held the band up to her lips, “TX: Code 2814-1724.” The light flickered and she let her hand fall. Anna looked around the room one last time. A blue scarf lay on the ground beneath her bed and she reached down for it. Her fingers gripped the soft fabric and picked it up. Straightening back up, she looked at it for a moment. Then, without a sound she laid it on the bed and went to the door. No hesitation. Just leave, a voice whispered in her head. Gritting her teeth she opened the door and stepped into the hallway. Pulling up her hood, she started down the hallway. “Anna?” She ignored the call and took a hard right. Where is the blasted hanger? She looked down the hall trying to navigate her way through the mostly unknown base. That way goes to the Atrium and the… she stopped dead in her tracks. The cell blocks. Her breath caught in her throat and she turned down another unexplored hall. “Anna!” Rey’s voice yelled at her and Anna ducked around a corner, as the girl ran after her. Pressing her back to the wall, she waited for the girl to pass. Rey ran right past her. Pushing herself off the wall she stepped behind the girl and held her hand out forcing the girl to stop in her tracks. Rey’s body went rigid. Stepping behind her Anna wrapped her arm around her throat, “Take me to the hanger.” Rey spoke through clenched teeth, “Why---are you doing this?” “Just take me there and I’ll let you go.” Rey groaned under the weight of Anna’s power over her, “Right.” Anna pushed the girl forward and they took a right down the hall. “Go straight,” Rey said as they came to a cross section. Rey whispered as they made their way down a set of stairs, “You don’t have to do this, Anna, I won’t tell anyone.” “Rey, for once, could you please just do as I tell you.” The girl shut up and led them onwards, “This is it, but you can’t get in without the passcode.” “Then give it to me,” Anna growled out. “No.” “Rey,” she said dropping her voice in warning. “We both know you won’t kill me, Anna. Stop this.” Anna stood in front of the girl and stared at her, “I have to leave. Please, Rey.” “Why?” Anna looked at the ground, “Just open the door.” She stepped away from the girl and let go of the Force. Rey’s shoulders slumped and she stepped away. Anna looked into her eyes, pleading, “Rey, I’m begging you. Open the door.” The girl stared at her for what seemed like eternity, before she stepped up to the door. With several beeps the door finally slid open. With a small nod, Anna stepped through the door and into the hanger. Rey followed her, “Where will you go?” “Even if I knew, Rey, I wouldn’t tell you.” “What about Ben? You’re just going to leave him here?” Anna stopped. “I’m trying to make this right,” she said. The sounds of a droid drifted to them and they looked behind them to see TX speeding towards them. Anna stepped in front of her X-Wing, “Start her up, TX.” The droid rolled past her and she turned back to Rey, “I’m sorry, but there’s no other way, Rey.” “You can’t just leave,” the younger girl said, “We still need you---.” “I’m useless now. I can’t help you, I’m not even sure I can handle this.” Anna crossed her arms over her torso and shook her head. Rey shook her head, “Anna, what’s wrong?” She stepped forward and laid a hand on Anna’s shoulder. Her mentor looked up as the ship’s engines turned on, “Everything,” she whispered. Suddenly she threw her hand up and pushed Rey back from her. She forced Rey to her knees and leaned down. The girl stared up at her. “I’m sorry,” Anna said. With a deep breath she waved her hand in the girl’s face and released her. Rey sighed and slumped forward, unconscious. Anna propped her up against some boxes, and stood up ready to walk away. The gleam of Rey’s lightsaber caught her eye, and she crouched back down. Silently and efficiently she unclipped the weapon from the girl’s belt and hung it on her own. “I need this more than you do right now.” Pulling back her hood, she ran over to the ship, and climbed up the ladder. “Get us out of here, TX,” she ordered as she strapped herself in. Pulling on her helmet, she looked out the window as the hanger doors opened, and TX fired the engines. The ship rose into the air, and took off out of the hanger. Anna closed her eyes. The ship shook around her as they hit turbulence. After several moments of rough riding, they leveled out. “Take us into orbit,” she said. Anna looked down at the bright white world below them. “TX, I need you to record a message, and transmit it to the base.” She flipped a switch, and thought for a moment, “Make that two messages.” *************************************************************************** He was finally getting used to the darkness they kept him locked up in. It would be funny that on his last night alive he was actually able to stand the silence and void of night he was trapped within. “It is the opinion of this council, that the prisoner is too dangerous. Despite the clear interest Master Skywalker has shown in retraining him, we are all in accordance. Ben Solo, for your crimes against the Republic, and this organization, you are subsequently sentenced to death.” The guards were quiet after they had left the sentencing. No more beatings, they’d even been gracious enough to leave an entire bottle of water for him. Taking another sip of the cool liquid, he ran fingers through his hair. “Open it up,” a voice came from the door. Ben stood as the cell was opened, and bright lights blinded him. “It’s a little early for an execution, don’t you think?” he asked. Strong hands grabbed him and pulled him out of the cell, forcing him to his knees. Ben looked up. “What are you doing here?” he asked. Luke leaned down, “There’s been a change of plans.” The hands holding him released him, and slowly he stood. Captain Ara’ve stepped forward, “Ben Solo, your sentence has been acquitted. You are here-by released into the custody of Luke Skywalker, Jedi Master. You are free to go.” The guards escorted them from the cellblock, and Ben looked to his uncle, “What’s going on? Did Anna---?” “She’s gone, Ben.” The younger man opened his mouth, but Luke stopped him, “Wait. We’ll talk about it in a moment.” Luke signed some papers, then led him down the hallway. “Where are we going?” Ben asked. “Somewhere we can talk. It was the middle of the night, and no one saw them as they made their way down the corridor. They came to a hallway and slipped inside one of the rooms. Luke pushed Ben inside, before following him. “What’s going on?” Luke sighed. “You should sit down,” he said motioning to the table. Sliding into a seat, the Jedi clasped his hands and waited for Ben to take a seat. Warily the young man did so. Luke cleared his throat, “Anna disappeared from the base 7 hours ago. Rey found us soon after she left. She hasn’t told us much, but the resistance tracked Anna until she her ship jumped to light speed an hour later.” Ben leaned forward and frowned, “Where did she go?” “We don’t know, her x-wing is untraceable. She and I made sure of that after… the Academy fell.” Luke looked down at his hands, “The point is, during that hour of time, she remained in orbit. Then the Resistance received a transmission.” Luke sighed, “She admitted to killing the guard, that it was an accident and that you had nothing to do with his death. The Council was forced to let you go.” The older man leaned forward, “Unless new evidence comes forward they can’t touch you.” “But Anna---.” “Now has a bounty on her head.” Standing up Ben began to pace, “This is exactly what I didn’t want to happen. Why couldn’t she just listen?” Luke cleared his throat and Ben glanced at him. The Jedi reached into his pocket and pulled out a holo cube, “There’s something I didn’t tell the Resistance. A few hours ago, I received this transmission. It’s encrypted with the same code we used at the Academy.” He pushed the cube across the table, “It’s for you.” Ben walked over to the table and picked up the holo and stared at it. Luke stood up and clapped a hand on his shoulder, “I’ll leave you alone,” he said as he walked to the door. He turned around, “Just don’t go anywhere tonight, alright?” The younger man nodded his head and Luke left. Rolling up his sleeves Ben sat down at the table, and turned the cube over in his hands. With a soft clack he set the hologram down in front of him and pressed a button. A familiar, but blue, face stared at him from underneath a pilot’s helmet. “Ben,” Anna’s voice said through the speaker. “By now, Luke’s filled you in on…” she shook her head, “It wasn’t right, letting you take the fall for me. It was my responsibility.” TX whistled in the background and Anna reached up and flipped something on in the cockpit. She turned back to the camera, “I wasn’t going to run away, but---,” she sighed and closed her eyes, “Blast it, I don’t even know how to say this. I’m pr---.” Another chortle from the droid interrupted her and she frowned. “I have to go, Ben. Her hand reached out like she was trying to touch him, then he realized she was about to turn the camera off. “Goodbye, Ben. May the Force be with you.” Her eyes held so much pain, “I love you.” ************************************************************************* Anna closed her eyes as stars whizzed past her as they went to light speed. TX needed a new memory, if he could only handle recording two messages. Maybe it was good that TX had cut her off. Spare Ben any guilt or the urge to seek her out. She would be fine. She was perfectly capable of being alone. She shook her head, and let her hand rest against her belly. How hard is it to say? If only she spoken a few seconds faster. For the first time ever she let the words slip from her lips in a whisper, “I’m pregnant…” ************************************************************************* He squeezed his hand into a fist. Like all things the new hand had taken some getting used to. “I have sensed several disturbances in the Force,” the large hologram said from above him, “My apprentice, have you located him, General Hux?” The man cleared his throat, “Not as of yet, Supreme Leader. If he was taken captive, we have no intelligence as to where the Resistance is hiding, and if Ren is dead---.” “He is alive,” Snoke spat, “As for that girl…” “We do have some news on that front my lord. It seems someone has issued a bounty for her, and she has been labeled as a traitor of the Resistance.” “Hmmmm.” Snoke was silent for a moment, before he held out his hand, “The Force is fractured. It splinters where the knight once stood. Wherever she goes Kylo Ren will not be far behind. Bring her to me,” the image commanded before it disappeared. Hux turned on his heel and started down the walkway, “With pleasure.” Notes: WOW!!! 2,000 and more hits!!! Thanks so much for reading and commenting guys. Keep letting me know what you think and might like to see. I know smut is probably the one I'll hear about the most, but I'm not sure it's going to work out guys. Example: I was home alone today, and was just about to start writing a smut scene for this chapter. Then... Nay-Nay came home. Nay-Nay: "What're you doing?" Me: "Um... Homework?" Nay-Nay:"Why are you asking me?" I cleared my throat and looked away, "Homework, I am definitely doing homework." (I just don't think it's meant to be. Any suggestions are welcome!) P.S. Do't get me wrong I'm happy with this chapter, it's just missing a smut scene. Well, Que Sera, Sera. Laters-Mahana Chapter 23 : BOOK II: GREY AREA Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) The room was silent as he sat on the bed, stroking the blue material with his fingers. His eyes were closed as he hung his head. A soft voice fell on his ears like a whisper, “ Ben…” His eyes flew open, “Ben?” a voice asked behind him. He twisted around on the bed and looked at the door. A familiar yet timid smile greeted him. His mother walked over to him and sat down looking at the garment in his hands with a raised eyebrow. “I’m sorry, but Anna did what she felt was needed” Leia put a hand on his shoulder, “I’m sure she had a good reason for leaving.” Ben swallowed and stood up, his back straight as he stared down at the scarf caught between his fingers, “I have to find her,” he said quietly. Leia sighed, “Ben…” “Luke said you put a bounty on her. Is that true?” he asked turning around. He had deep circles beneath his eyes his body clearly exhausted from the stress of the past months. “ I didn’t put the bounty out, Ben,” Leia said rising from her seat. Her hands ran down his arms and she looked up at him, “But there are people here, people in the Resistance that think she should be punished.” Ben’s eyes met hers and his face turned hard, “The Resistance isn’t the only one with an interest in her, mom.” Understanding came into his mother’s eyes, “Snoke,” she said softly. “He’s looking for me. For her. I have to get to her before the First Order or the Resistance does.” He turned and stared out the window. “And you think you’ll have better luck than the best bounty hunters in the galaxy.” “If I know Anna, she won’t stay hidden from me for long.” Ben cleared his throat and looked down at his feet, black locks falling over his face, “And the sooner I’m gone, the faster you can get back to your duty.” Leia forced him to turn around, “What is this about?” He looked at her, his face marred by a scar and the weight of so much pain resting on his shoulders, “Dad--- I don’t deserve to be free---not after…” His breathing hitched. Cold hands framed his face and aged, blue eyes stared up at him, “Don’t. Your father, loved you, and understood--- Ben, that wasn’t you.” She looked down and pressed a palm over his heart, “And I am sorry, that you will have to live with his death for the rest of your life.” Tears spilled from her eyes, and she looked but up at him, her voice breaking, “But you are my son— hah —and I just want what is best for you…” She looked down and leaned her head against his chest. Ben froze, with his eyes wide and his mouth slightly open. Slowly he moved his arms and wrapped them around her. He leaned down, “I am so sorry,” he whispered. Leia looked up at him with teary eyes, and cupped his cheek, “I know,” she whispered, “I know.” ************************************************************* “Anna, she wants to see you.” She looks up at the tall bearded man. He has the same blue eyes and brown hair that she does. “Yes, Papa.” He looks sad , she thinks to herself, as he takes her by the hand. His normally bright and shiny eyes seem dull, and he has big circles under his eyes. “Come here, sweetheart,” he says, as he picks her up and opens the door. The room is dim, cool. One of the women from the building moves out of the way, holding a small bundle wrapped and tied in white linen. A warm hand turns her face away as the woman goes by, then Anna is carried to the side of the bed. A woman with black hair and green eyes lays on her back looking up at them through hooded eyes. Sweat drips down her brow. “Annie?” she murmurs. Her father set her down and she crawls over to the bed, “Mommy?” she asks, as the woman runs fingers through her hair. “Shush, darling.” She lays a hand on Anna’s and looks up at her, “Take care of your father, and be happy, my beautiful girl,” she whispers. Her green eyes focus on the figure behind her and she shakes her head, tears spilling from beneath her eyelids, “Jax, I can’t…” “Let’s let mommy rest okay, sweetheart?” her father asks. A large hand take Anna by the hand and she’s led from the room. **************************************************** Anna shook her head as the ship came out of hyperspace. Wiping her face on her sleeve she clears her throat and looks at the screen and let out a groan, “Come on, TX, I said Tatooine, not Naboo!” She took the stick, as TX whistled in her ear, “Just plot me a new course before---.” “Unidentified aircraft, you have entered the orbit region. Please provide clearance.” “Shit,” Anna hissed. She turned off the radio and thought for a moment, “Shit, Shit, Shit!” Anna- there was nothing we could do. I’m sorry.” She remains silent, and the ship jerks. “TX, give me the controls,” Luke orders, from the seat behind her. With a beep, Luke takes over and she lets go of the stick, her hands shaking. __________________________________________________________________ “Please, give your identification code,” an automated voice said over the comms. Luke clears his voice, “Skywalker, 218-917.” “Approved.” “What was that?” Anna asks turning around in her seat. “We all have our secrets.” __________________________________________________________________ “---Identify yourself, or you will be fired upon.” Anna looks up as a nebula class fighter passes over her. TX tweets something at her, “I know, I know, will you just shut up?” She readjusts their course and flips the communication system back on. “Um. Skywalker, 218-9…” Anna grits her teeth, What was the ending!? The voice asked her again, and she yelled quickly into the mike, “Skywalker, 218-917!” Time seemed to stop and then a miracle voice came over the airwaves, “Approved.” With a sigh of relief, Anna leaned back into her seat as instructions came up on the computer. “TX take control,” she said, as her stomach fluttered. She closed her eyes and pressed a hand against her mouth. The close quarters began to mess with her, and she tried to steady her breathing. “I really hate flying…” *********************************************************************** TX did his best to set them down gently, but the second they touched down, Anna opened up the cockpit, letting clean, fresh, cool air blow on her face. The light dizziness she had been feeling evaporated and she let out a sigh. As she climbed down the ladder. Throwing her helmet back inside she turned around just in time to see a Naboo navy officer walking towards her at a brisk pace. With a quick nod he began talking, “The council and people of Naboo welcome you to our planet… Miss?” Anna took a step forward, “Dameron,” she lied. “I am lieutenant Ashesla. It has been a long time since someone used your access code.” The two of them began to trek down the walkway. He looked her up and down, his eyes stopping on the hilt of Rey’s lightsaber that hung from her belt. She cleared her throat drawing his attention back to her eyes, “I’m an apprentice to Master Skywalker--- the Jedi.” TX rolled up next to her, and tweeted something discernable. She looked down at the droid and spoke slowly, “I… have been tasked with charting the First Order’s trade routes, we have reason to believe they have contacts on the planet.” They came to a stop in front of an elevator. Ashesla narrowed his eyes briefly, “The Royal Council has been made aware of your arrival. You have garnered attention from the hierarchy. Queen Andola wishes to speak with you.” Anna frowned as they stepped inside the elevator as a wave of déjà vu washed over her. “Queen Andola wishes to speak with you,” Ashesla’s voice repeated in her mind. Where had she heard that before? Notes: Short chapter I know! It's been a long day, as usual. I hope you enjoy it, also I could use some feedback guys! Reading your comments brings me happiness, and it lets me know how my story is being received. Kudos are fine too... I guess... ;) Chapter 24 : BOOK II : GREY AREA Summary: Alright, so lesson learned: don't post chapters when you're half asleep and can't see straight. Thanks, pedobearsmiles for pointing that out! Here is the newest chapter! “Goodbye, Ben. May the Force be with you--- I love you.” How many times had he watched the holo? With a beep, he turned the projection off and laid back on the bed. His mother had left him alone for the day, and there was no sign of Luke coming back anytime soon. With a sigh he sat up and looked down at the message cube in his hands. Why couldn’t you just listen? Something wasn’t right. There was no way she would have just left. Teary eyes stare up at him, “We can leave, and go away, somewhere they’ll never find us.” “I should have gone,” he murmured under his breath. “Where to?” Ben twisted around, as Luke closed the door behind Rey who was staring at him silently. Standing up from the bed, he dropped the holo cube onto the bedside table and crossed his arms, “Any news?” he asked. Luke shook his head, “They aren’t going to let you leave this base without supervision. It’s too soon, and they don’t trust you.” “Can you blame them?” Rey asked off to the side. The two men looked at her and she fidgeted, obviously not meaning to voice such an opinion aloud. Ben sat back down on the bed with a thud, “I have to get to her before anyone else does.” Luke reached into his robes, “I thought you would say that. You see there’s really only one way to get past the Council’s demands.” “And what’s that?” “I come with you.” Ben frowned and shook his head, “Just get me a ship and a blaster. I can handle the rest on my own.” “Then you will also have the same bounty hunters chasing you that Anna is now evading. Ben, we can help you,” Luke finished softly, and held his hand out. Ben looked at the saber in the man’s hand. He spoke through clenched teeth, “Where did you get that?” “I kept it after we took you back to the Academy. After--- after Anna and I left,” Luke paused, “I gave it to her.” Rey cleared her throat, “But she couldn’t find it before she left, so she took mine.” Ben looked at her, “And I assume you’ll be coming as well?” The girl shrugged, “She’s my friend, plus I still need to pay her back for all of her wonderful training,” she finished sarcastically. “Uncle,” Ben said shifting his focus onto Luke, “How do you know I won’t turn on you?” he asked, nodding to the lightsaber, the man was still holding out to him. Luke shrugged, “I don’t. But I am trusting you. This is your chance, Ben. Wipe the slate clean.” **************************************************************** TX whistled, and Anna stopped in her tracks. “Is everything alright?” Ashesla asked. His dark brow furrowed beneath his cap. Anna turned around and nodded, “Would it be possible to have my droid’s memory transferred to a new data core? He’s been acting up lately,” she said sending a harsh look towards the droid. “Of course, I’ll have someone take a look at him.” The lieutenant waved a mechanic over, “Have someone take a look at this droid’s memory chip, and transfer all data to a new one.” “Yes, sir,” the mechanic replied, and waved for TX to follow him. With a reluctant whistle the droid went along with the man. “This way,” Ashesla said. As they walked Anna marveled at the grace and beauty of Naboo’s architecture. There was a subtleness to the buildings and it felt, as she walked down the narrow street, like they had been there a millennia, quietly standing watch. “Is this your first mission?” the lieutenant asked. Anna looked at him in surprise, “It’s complicated,” she answered. The man gave a small nod and led onward. They passed through a market, filled with people, vibrant colors, and the sweet scent of exotic foods. Her mouth watered as they passed by one of the stands, with piles of fruit. When was the last time she had eaten? They took a few steps forward, when the horrific stench of fish flooded her senses. Anna’s body seized up and she froze. A hand flew to her mouth as she gagged. She tried to hide her queasiness, but Ashesla turned around and looked at her in concern. “Are you alright?” he asked taking a step forward in concern. Anna held a hand out to him and nodded her head quickly. “Augh---,” she gagged, and turned around, running and pushing her way through the crowd of people. Leaning against the alley side of one of the buildings she had been recently admiring, she threw her guts up, not caring about the people who passed her by, shooting her odd looks. “Blast,” she breathed, once there was nothing left in her stomach. She wiped her mouth on her sleeve and moved away from the alley. Lieutenant Ashesla was waiting on the street for her, his face showing his concern. Anna pressed a hand to her stomach and sighed. The smells of the market made her want to gag again. She looked up at the lieutenant, his eyes focused on her hand that was subconsciously rubbing her stomach. Her face flushed with embarrassment, and Anna instantly let her arm fall. The second it did the officer glanced at her face. “Here,” he said, holding a bag out to her. Tentatively she took the bag from him and opened it to be greeted by the warm scent of fresh bread. With a sigh she broke a piece off and nibbled at it. Closing her eyes she gave a sigh, as her stomach began to settle. Then she quickly began to devour the bread. “Thank you,” she mumbled between bites. “Don’t mention it. We can’t have you retching all of her Royal highness, now can we?” Anna would have laughed if her mouth was not so full. Looking up she caught him studying her. He quickly looked away. Anna swallowed her food, and threw the bag away, “I’m sorry, for… that,” she said looking back at the alley she had been in just moments before. “I thought Jedi were more… I don’t know… more vigorous.” “Sorry to disappoint you,” Anna said crossing her arms and giving him a hard look. Having babies isn’t a part of our Jedi training, she thought to herself grumpily. “I’m not disappointed, I’m actually astounded to even be speaking with a Jedi,” Ashesla smiled. Anna cleared her throat ready to move away from the market, “We should probably get going, don’t you think?” she asked. She took a step past him and then looked over her shoulder, “Thanks, for the bread.” **************************************************************************** “Come in,” Leia called as she stacked a pile of data pads on her desk. She turned around slowly and gave a half-smile, “Ben.” He looked around the room, his hair pulled back away from his face, half-up half-down. He cleared his throat, “I- uh, I wanted to say goodbye, before we left.” He straightened his back and stood like a statue in front of her. “Luke told me you were all leaving. I wish I could come with you.” Ben shook his head, “It’s a wild Fynock chase. I’m not really sure where to start.” He looked down for a moment, “She doesn’t want to be found, but---,” he bit the inside of his cheek, “I can’t just leave her out there.” “Tail a bounty hunter, let them do the hard work,” Leia said, handing him a data pad. He took it, his eyebrows shifting in surprise, “What’s this?” “It’s a list of the bounty hunters the Resistance officially contacted to find her. I’m told that they’re the best…” Leia frowned and leaned forward, putting a hand on his shoulder, “Find her, Ben, before they do. The council issued a dead or alive bounty.” She shook her head as Ben turned to stare at her, “I only just found out, so you need to hurry. Anna’s a fighter, and it’s a lot easier to bring a Jedi back dead rather than kicking and screaming.” ********************************************************* Anna stared up at the vaulted ceilings above her. Ashesla cleared his throat and she shook her head, “This way,” the man said holding out his hand. Without a word she followed behind him. They walked up the marble steps passing by the portraits of previous Queens. Green and red tapestries hung overhead, and well-dressed nobles and politicians passed them by. It was spectacular, and timeless. It was an ancient city set against the backdrop of technological advancements and exotic populations. She looked to the side and stopped as one of the portraits caught her eye. A woman, crowned and regally dressed stared at her serenely. Dark hair and brown eyes peered out from beneath a bejeweled headdress. There was something so familiar about her. “You’re joking,” she laughs as they walk down the trail to the lake. Soft sunlight shines through the clouds above. “Nope. You are in the presence of a prince. The grandson of Queen Padme Amidala of Naboo.” Ben wraps an arm around her shoulder as they walk together. He leans close to her ear, “Are you shocked yet? You peasant, you should feel honored to be graced by my attentions,” he whispered. “Ha!” Anna squealed as his hands drifted down her sides as he moved to walk behind her. She grabs him by the arm, and twists around, kicking his feet out from under him. With a yell he falls to the ground. With a smirk she stands above him, feigning concern, “Oh, I’m sooo sorry, Your Highness.” “Miss Dameron?” Ashesla asked as she stopped to stare at one of the portraits. The lieutenant came back down the stairs and stopped beside her, “Queen Amidala, she reigned before the Clone Wars,” he said. “She’s so beautiful,” Anna whispered. “Yes, she was,” Ashesla looked at his watch and gave a small cough, “I’m sorry, but we’re actually supposed to be there---.” “Oh, I’m sorry,” Anna said turning to face him. He nodded his head and proceeded up the stairs without her. She gave one last look at the portrait on the wall. Ben, if only you could see this. As they reached the top of the stairs they were greeted by a security team. Anna scanned the group of men. They were well-armed, and although they were not aiming their guns at her, something told her they would not hesitate. They each stared back at her blank faced, and a nervous feeling coiled in her gut. Ashesla spoke with the man in charge briefly before turning back to her. “I’m going to have to ask you to surrender your weapon,” he said looking down at her waist. Anna shook her head, “No.” The men in front of her visibly stiffened and their hands twitched. Forcing her chin up, Anna stared at the Captain behind Ashesla, who spoke quickly, “You must understand, it’s standard protocol to eliminate any threat---.” “And it’s my protocol to keep my lightsaber handy,” she said turning her blue eyes on him. The lieutenant looked back at his superior. Taking a step forward the man held out his hand to his men, “Let her in.” The soldiers looked at one another, before stepping apart, and escorting her to the doors to the throne room, “Any disturbances and you’ll be taken into custody,” the Captain said from behind her. She gave a hard nod. Let’s get this shit over with and get the hell out of here. Silently the group proceeded into the room. The throne room was huge, with a domed ceiling and frescoes of the ancient Naboo. At the end of the burgundy carpet ahead of them sat a young woman, More like a young girl, Anna thought to herself. She had blonde hair, pulled back elegantly and sleek. A silver diadem rested on her brow and icy blue eyes stared into Anna’s. The Queen’s pale skin was stark against that of her ruby colored gown. Not to be unnerved Anna held her head high and level. When they reached the end of the carpet everyone knelt before the Queen. Stiffly and courteously, Anna bent over at her waist. She would not kneel. With a wave of her hand, Queen Andola sent away Anna’s escort, “Leave us,” she commanded in a pristine yet shrill voice. The Captain beside Anna looked up, ready to object, but he ceased when his eyes met the Queens. Without another word the group of guards and attendants left the hall. Once the doors were closed, all that was left was Anna, standing straight and tall. “What is your name?” “Rey, Your Highness. Rey Dameron.” “I thought the Jedi were extinct,” the young girl asked raising a sharp eyebrow, “A harmless story we tell children to inspire them.” “Yes, well if we serve to inspire, what of Emperor Palpatine? He was once a part of Naboo’s political system. Was he truth, or fiction?” Anna asked. “A fair point, but not really an answer.” “The Jedi are as real as you and the throne upon which you sit, your Highness.” The girl clasped her hands together in her lap and let a small smile slip onto her lips, “I can tell you have been tutored in diplomacy. You say what you want, without saying any of it at all.” She stood up and circled Anna, the train of her gown trailing behind her, “Aren’t you a little young to be a Jedi. Our stories say that they were old men of great power.” “Aren’t you a little young to be Queen?” Anna asked. Andola stopped in front of her, “My people have always elected queens of youth. Our innocence makes us wise.” Anna pressed her shoulders back and stared at the girl, “Why did you wish to speak with me? I offer your people no harm, I’m only here to observe and document---.” “The First Order’s trade routes, yes, yes I know,” the Queen said waving her hand as she returned to her seat, “But that’s not why you’re really here, is it?” Anna took a deep breath and fought to remain calm. She smiled, “I have no idea what you mean, Your Highness.” With a swipe of her hand, Andola summoned a series of holograms into the air between them. “My intelligence is not limited by my age, Commander Kuro.” Anna bit her cheek as the Queen shook her head, “Naboo is a strong supporter of the Resistance in this part of the galaxy. Did you not think we would have received word of their search for you?” Anna sighed as she crossed her arms and toed the edge of the rung beneath her feet, “The thought did cross my mind once I realized my droids mistake. I guess you’ve already contacted them?” she asked, all decorum flying out the window. “Not yet.” ************************************************************************* “Are you sure about this?” Ben asks as he and Luke walk towards the Millennium Falcon. “Anna’s my student, Ben, I practically raised her. She’s like a daughter.” The man stopped at the foot of the ramp, “I owe her this at least.” Rey walked down from the ship and greeted them each with a nod, “We’re ready Master Skywalker.” A howl bellowed down from inside the ship, and Rey sighed, “He said he’s coming too, whether you agree or not.” Luke planted a hand on her shoulder as he started inside, “The more the merrier.” With that he left Ben and Rey behind as he disappeared inside the ship. The two youths looked at one another. “Thank you,” Ben said, “For helping---.” Rey cut him off with a glare, “I’m not doing this for you . Anna’s my mentor and my friend,” she turned around and started after Luke, “Plus she took my lightsaber. I’d like to get it back.” Ben called after her, “Rey.” She stopped and turned around, “What?” “Thank you.” The girl rolled her eyes and entered the Falcon. Ben looked up at the ship and for the first time in years he started inside of his own free will. “I’m coming for you, Anna.” Chapter 25 : BOOK II : GREY AREA Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “Why wouldn’t you?” Anna asked, as she brought her hands out from behind her back, letting them hand down at her hips, ready to draw her weapon. Queen Andola tilted her head to the side and studied her, “Because I think you have something better to offer me than useless credits.” Anna frowned, “And what would that be?” Leaning back the young woman pointed to the balcony, “There are times when the legislature circumvents my attempts to---.” The Jedi held up her hand cutting her off, “You want my powers to further your agenda,” Anna shook her head, “The Force doesn’t work like that. Mass persuasion, it’s impractical, and dangerous.” “But you can do it,” the young queen pressed. Anna bit her tongue, She’s not going to let this go. It was crude, but she could use this, get the monarchy her needed votes here and there, and then lay low. The Jedi looked right into those icy blue eyes, “Not on the level you’re thinking of.” “I just need a few hearts to change here and there.” “You want me to corrupt your political system. Your people---.” Andola stood from her throne, “My people do not know what they need. I do.” She stood in front of Anna and stared up at the taller woman, “You need me, and I need you. I can keep you safe from the Resistance and the First Order---.” Anna shook her head in confusion, “The First Order?” The younger woman turned around and brought another series of data and pictures, most notably a higher bounty price than that of the Resistance’s offer. “They’re all looking for you,” Andola said smugly, “Which leads me to one conclusion: I’m your best shot at staying alive.” “What are you offering?” Anna asked. She grimaced as the thought of just how little power she had at the moment. “Nothing too daunting. A home in the countryside, privacy and safety. In return, you help me square away certain elections and voting events. Of course, once I reach the maximum level of terms you’ll have to move on, but that won’t be for a few years. What I’m offering is relative safety, and I’m not asking for much.” Anna crossed her arms over her torso protectively, “Alright, I’ll do it, but no one can know that I am here.” Andola bowed her head and smiled, “Of course.” ************************************************************************* Three weeks later… Rain pattered down off of the glass roofs, as the human male trudged along on the city street below. A large shadow, passed overhead, and he whirled around searching the air above, only to find more rain. He shook his head, trying to ignore the feeling that he was being watched. Wiping the water off of his face he walked inside a seedy bar. Across the way, a hooded figure crouched on the rooftop, watching for the man to return. “Ben?” a voice asked in his earpiece. He pulled his hood farther down and pressed a hand to his ear, “Yeah, I’m here.” “Have you found Caaladra yet?” Luke asked. Static buzzed in the young man’s ear and he tapped the microphone next to his mouth with a grimace. “He’s inside the bar, just like Dreel said.” “Are you sure you don’t want one of us to come help---.” “I’m fine Uncle,” Ben said as he moved beneath a canopy, trying to get out of the rain. “Alright, just, don’t draw---.” “Draw unnecessary attention. I know---,” Ben stopped as the bar door opened and the mark walked out into the street. The man swayed back and forth clearly inebriated, “He’s out.” Standing up he followed the man along the rooftops, jumping over pipes and staying just out of sight. Caaladra looked around before he ran into an alley. Gritting his teeth, Ben followed after the man. Quietly he scaled down the wall, careful of the water slick glass windows in his way. He reached into his cloak, and brought out his lightsaber, ready to use it if necessary as he ran across the street. Speeders raced by, as he dodged and ran through the rain. It was a dead end alley way, filled with garbage and refuse. The stench made him grit his teeth. The sound of someone retching echoed off the pavement. Ben squinted into the darkness. A drunk, not Caaladra, was bent over hurling up his guts. The young man walked past him, no sight of his prey, yet. In a rumble of scattering cans and bags of garbage, a shadow burst out of the pile and tackled him with a yell. “Oof!” Ben landed on his back and the larger man straddled him, drawing back his fist. With a growl, the reformed Jedi, thrust his palm at the man, and a low hum filled the air. Gritting his teeth, he sent the bounty hunter flying back. Groaning, Ben got to his feet and looked behind him at the homeless spectators gathered around to watch. “Get out of here!” he yelled at them, as he ignited his saber. The blue-green glow reflected off the glass buildings around them and he watched as the men retreated from him. He turned to Caaladra, who was struggling underneath a pile of garbage that had fallen all over him. Ben turned off his saber and reached down, grabbing the man by the collar of his shirt. With little effort he pulled the hunter up and forced him against the wall. “Watch it!” the man spat. “You told another bounty hunter you knew where to find a Jedi two weeks ago. You’re going to tell me where she is.” “I don’t know,” the man said clenching his jaw and holding up his hands in defeat. Ben glared at him, “Do not lie to me.” He pulled the man forward then slammed him back against the wall. Caaladra wheezed, “Alright, alright!” Ben released him and backed away, “Then you better start talking. Now.” The old bounty hunter shook his head and leaned against the wall, “I don’t know where to find the Jedi, but I know who does.” ************************************************************************** “You’ve got to be kidding me,” Luke said shaking his head. Ben pulled on a dry shirt as they looked at the Falcon’s map, “That’s what I said.” Rey shook her head, “Who’s Boba Fett?” Both men turned and looked at her, “Seriously?” they asked in unison. Ben shook his head and grabbed a bottle of water as Luke sat down with a sigh. “He’s only that best bounty hunter in the Galaxy. He’s tough. Last time I saw him, he was sliding down a saarlacc’s throat,” he looked off to the side, “Not a good way to go.” “What’s a saarlacc?” Ben sat down and shook his head, “That’s not the point. The fact is no one can find this guy, unless he wants to be found. Once he has a target he doesn’t take on any new customers until he’s done.” Rey’s eyebrows shot up, “So, if he’s hunting Anna…” Luke sighed as Ben stared down at his palms that quickly balled up into fists. Shifting his body, Luke said quietly, “He won’t appreciate the fact that we’re trying to find her too.” ****************************************************************************** Anna leaned against the sink as she washed her mouth out. Spitting out the water, she reached for a towel and wiped her mouth. This whole morning sickness thing was getting old. Who named it morning sickness anyway? It’s night time! Pulling back her hair, she walked out of the bathroom, and laid down on the bed. TX rolled into the room without a sound. She looked out the window. The sun had just set and its last rays of light were quickly leaving her in the dark. Turning on the lamp she stood up and went to the mirror. Andola had kept her word so far, Anna had a luxurious estate on a lake. No one bothered her, except the guards every now and then as they made their rounds. With a sigh she pulled up her shirt and looked at her belly in the mirror. She had only been there three weeks and she was getting restless. She pressed a hand against her stomach and frowned. Luckily there was no sign of a bump yet, and no one on the planet knew anything about the baby, but it was only a matter of time before she would start to show. That thought scared her. It made her feel weak and vulnerable. She would have a lot explaining to do, but more than anything she knew they would use the baby against her. She needed to plan, but where could she go? Letting her shirt fall, she turned around and went back to bed as TX powered down in the corner of her room. Shaking her head she uttered words she never thought she would say, “Tatooine would have been so much better.” Notes: So, shortish chapter, I know! But hey, if you're looking for another Kylo Ren/ OC fic check out my new one I just posted last night: Descent into Darkness. Don't worry I'm not giving up on Finding Balance, but this idea came to me last night and I HAD to write it, or it wouldn't leave me alone. It's a multi chapter fic too, but much darker than this one. Or at least it's going to be. Feel free to drop by! Chapter 26 : BOOK II : GREY AREA Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Rey fidgeted as Luke and Ben watched the building across the street. Luke glanced at her, “Rey…” “What?” she asked as she laid down on the bed. Ben looked down at the blaster she was holding, “Do you mind not playing with that? What if you accidentally---.” The girl rolled her eyes and looked across the street, “I know how to use a gun, Ben.” The two men glanced at each other. Luke spoke quickly, “Just put it away for now.” Rey sighed and set the gun over on the table. Standing up she went and peeked out the window. “No one’s there. We’ve been watching for three days.” Luke shook his head, “The Twi’lek that Chewie found said there’s always someone there. If not Fett, then a woman.” She shook her head, “It doesn’t look very bounty hunterish.” They all looked out the window once more. It was an elegant townhouse, stylish with columns and the latest security mods. It had it all. Cameras, and alarm systems. If Luke had to venture a guess, he was pretty sure there were automated turrets hidden in there somewhere too. The Jedi Master sighed, “I think that’s the point.” “This is taking too long,” Ben said as he went to the computer console across the room. He typed a code in and waited as the computer placed the call. “ Connection Secure,” said an automated voice. Ben leaned forward as Chewbacca’s came over the system. Luke and Rey listened in, “Chewie, is there any word from the Resistance?” The Wookie’s reply came in the form of a short bark, No. Ben sighed and looked down at his hands, “Thanks,” he said. Reaching up he signed off. The room was quiet. Luke shifted in his chair and looked back at the estate, “No news is good news. If your mother hasn’t contacted us, then her people haven’t found Anna either.” Ben leaned back in his seat and stared at the ceiling, “That, or the First Order has her and we’re too late.” ****************************************************************************** Anna sat by the window watching big fat flakes of snow fall. Her feet were curled up beneath her as she sat on the cushioned window seat, a wooly blanket wrapped around her legs. TX wobbled next to her and whistled. She looked at him, “I didn’t think it was going to snow. It’s so green out there.” She pressed a hand to the cool glass and sighed. A knock came from the door and she swung her legs off the bench and stood, wrapping the blanket over her shoulders. Standing up she cleared her throat, “Come in.” A guard in winter gear opened the door and held it open as a familiar face strode in. Anna gave a polite smile, “Lieutenant Ashesla, I didn’t know you were here.” The guard closed the door and left them alone. The young man removed his hat and smiled, “The snow is a little early this year,” he said nodding to the window behind her. Anna glanced over her shoulder and shrugged, “Well, I wouldn’t know.” She turned back to him, “Is there something you need?” He coughed into his arm and nodded, “Queen Andola has requested that you return to the capital with me today. She said you would understand why.” Anna’s stomach churned, but she nodded and put on a smile, “Yes, I do.” She looked down, “I’ll need some time to get dressed and packed---.” “Of course. I’ll wait in the commons,” Ashesla walked to the door, “Take all the time you need,” he said. When the door closed Anna let out a sigh, and sat back down. Bending over she pressed a hand to her forehead and rocked. “You can do this,” she whispered. She pressed a shaking hand to her stomach, “You have to do this.” ****************************************************************************** Four moons shone overhead as Ben walked across the street. His face was grim, and he looked deathly pale, with deep circles beneath his eyes. Pulling back his hood he stopped in front of the gate and looked up at the estate. With a tentative hand he pushed on the intercom button. No answer. He waited a moment and looked behind him before pressing the button once more. Still no answer. A whirring sound caught his attention and looked up as a camera swiveled until it was pointed right at him. Keeping his eyes on the machinery he punched the intercom again. “What do you want?” Ben looked down, a green dot glowed next to the speaker as a woman’s voice spoke lowly. “I need information about a mark. I was told this was the place to get it.” There was a moment of silence and the green light flickered, “Who sent you?” “Caaladra.” The voice spoke gruffly, “The man is a fool. You’ve wasted enough of my time.” “Wait---!” The light went off. Ben hit the door with his fist, Blast! Stepping back he paced in front of the door, fire burning in his belly. A voice spoke in his ear, “Ben, calm down.” He turned around, and looked across the street. His eyes scanned the windows until he found the one he knew Luke and Rey were watching him from. He shook his head, and turned back to the door. “Ben,” the Jedi’s voice said, full of warning. Pulling back his fist Ben focused on the door and pushed. The power of the Force coursed through him and he grit his teeth. With a crack, the door blew off its hinges and landed with a heavy thud. Red lights flashed and alarms blared as he stepped inside. Cameras followed his every move. He took one step over the threshold, then another over the fallen door. He looked around the foyer, and the commons area. It was empty of furniture. Reaching behind his back he unclipped his lightsaber from his belt. Blue green light reflected off the walls as he started up the stairs. That was when all hell broke loose. ************************************************************************** Anna felt extremely self-conscious as she looked at herself in the mirror. It’s just me, she told herself as she looked at her belly, No one else will notice. It just looks like I’ve gained a little bit of weight. Just to be safe she went through two more outfits before she decided what she would take with her. In the end, she wore a loose grey tunic made of the finest silk. A red scarf was wrapped around her neck and her long brown hair was braided back into a bun. TX followed behind her as she left the bedroom and walked into the commons, a small bag slung over one shoulder. Ashesla stood up from his seat as she entered the room, “Are you ready?” he asked. Anna gave a silent nod, As ready as I’ll ever be. *********************************************************************** Ben pressed himself against the wall and peered around the corner. With a jerk he pulled back just as the turret fired at him. He looked across the hall and made eye contact with Rey. They each gave a nod. Taking a deep breath he brought his sword up and stepped out into the open. As he deflected shot after shot, Rey took aim, as the stationed gun stayed focused on him. Boom! Ben covered his eyes as the turret exploded in a flash of light. Lowering his hand he looked to the side at Rey, “Thanks,” he said with a nod. “You were supposed to wait,” Luke said as he stepped out from the shadows behind him. Ben shook his head, “You can lecture me later,” he said as he walked down the hall. He held his hand up as he marched and pushed the door open. Luke and Rey followed him inside the room silently. Three walls were covered with computer screens and control panels while one was committed solely to a plethora of weapons. Luke whistled, “I need a new hobby.” Rey walked over to the main computer console, “They were here, or someone was, they just logged out of the system two minutes ago.” Ben looked around the room, the only exit being the door they came in. “She’s still here,” he breathed. Rey turned around, “What does that--- Ben, behind you!” The man spun around just in time as a body tackled him with a battle cry. “Augh!” he croaked as he crashed into the ground, expelling every single breath of air he had from his lungs. His vision went spotty as Luke and Rey yelled at him. He looked up as a dark haired woman pressed a knife to his throat. She leaned down and spoke through clenched teeth that resembled fangs, “Who are you?” He couldn’t speak as he struggled to breathe. Luke crouched down and held a hand out to the woman, “We’re looking for someone. Boba Fett. You know him?” Their attacker glared at the old man, “Shut up, or I’ll slice his throat.” Luke moved away, giving her space. She looked back down at the man pinned beneath her, “Who. Are. You?” she spit. His voice came out in a hoarse whisper, “Ben— hack , Solo.” She frowned, “As in Han Solo?” Ben grimaced at the name, “Yes.” Luke broke in, “I’m sorry for attacking your home, my friend here,” he said looking at Ben’s face, “Was overzealous. We need to see Fett.” “Oh then why don’t you just make an appointment?” the girl asked sarcastically. She pressed the edge of her knife into Ben’s skin, “Better yet, why don’t you wait? He’ll be here once he gets my distress message.” “You’ve sent the message?” Rey asked her eyes meeting with Luke and Ben’s. The girl looked at her smugly, “Basically… yes---.” A hand closed around her wrist and she let out a gasp and looked down as a low hum filled all of her senses. Ben glared up at her, as the knife fell from her hand. Her body moved against her will as he sat up. He peered into her eyes, “Good.” Then, she knew no more. Notes: Thank you to everyone who has been reading this and my new fic, I really appreciate it. Not to sound like a scratched record, but you should really go read it!!!! (I promise this is the last time I'm going to advertise it here... scout's honor) In other news, I may have to put this fic on hold for a couple of days, I found out that my grandmother had a heart attack last night, so my life is kind of chaotic. It won't be for more than a week though, and I may just keep writing, since it helps keep my mind off things. Chapter 27 : BOOK II : GREY AREA Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “Miss Dameron?” Ashesla’s voice asked as Anna unbuckled her harness and stuck her head between her knees. Breathe. Just breathe. Staring at the floor of the ship between her feet she spoke in muffled tone, “Why do you call me that?” she asked. Andola had gathered her most trusted people and told them who she really was that day at the palace. The lieutenant was among them. Ashesla moved to the seat next to her, “Her Highness thought it would benefit you if we kept your real identity a secret.” Anna breathed through her nose as the ship jostled again, her fingers digging into the seat beneath her as he stomach churned. “Do you not like flying?” Ashesla asked. “My father was a pilot, but he died in a transport accident,” Anna said. “I’m sorry. What was his cargo?” Anna sat up as the flight smoothed out and sighed. She looked down at her hands, “Spice,” she said. Once the words escaped her she frowned. She never really spoke about her parents. She barely remembered them. All she knew was that “transport pilot,” really meant smuggler. It was one of the reasons she and Ben had connected, once they stopped trying to outdo one another that is. Neither of their fathers was ever there for more than a couple weeks at a time when they were children. Unable to stand the silent gaze of Ashesla, she shifted and asked, “Do you know what the queen is planning this week?” The lieutenant spoke softly, “She is hosting several dignitaries, senators, and councilors. Once we arrive at the palace, Queen Andola will share more. I believe she intends to introduce you to several of them.” Anna gave a stiff nod and began to think. Survival. Do what you have to and just survive. ********************************************************************** Rey had tied her to the chair, using knots he had never even heard of before. Still unconscious the girl sat with her head hanging down, her chin pressed to her chest. Ben sat across the room from the girl, flipping a small cube over and over in his hands. Luke had taken Rey to check out the rest of the mansion, before Fett arrived, leaving him to watch over the girl. He stared at her. They were so close, and Luke would not let him search the girl’s mind. It infuriated him. “If I have the ability, why shouldn’t I use it?” “Because she probably doesn’t know anything. Ripping open her mind will only damage her more. Be patient, Ben. You are not following the dark side anymore.” Was he though? Ben grit his teeth. He just felt so angry, like he could explode at any time. And when Luke lectured him on patience and compassion, all he saw was weakness. Shifting on the stool, Ben ran his fingers through his long hair. Anna. He needed to focus on her, finding her, protecting her. “Augh,” a voice groaned, ripping him away from his thoughts. Looking up he saw the hunter girl, looking around, and her eyes hazy. Noticing her restraints she jumped in her seat trying to wrestle out of them. “I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” Ben said standing up. Picking up the stool he walked over to her and sat down in front of her. “Let me go,” she commanded, her eyes glaring at him from beneath black bangs. He nodded to her with his chin, “What’s your name?” She looked away, “Go fuck yourself, scar face.” An invisible pressure pressed against her throat lightly and she looked at him startled. He narrowed his eye and stood up, “Now that I have your attention,” he growled as he put his hands on each armrest and leaned over her, “You’re going to tell me everything you know about your employer’s latest hunt.” ************************************************************************** Ashesla had left her in a private suite in the palace, telling her to stay put. Anna stared out the window overlooking a waterfall. A large moon hung on the horizon, the lights of the palace beautiful against the night sky. The man had been gone over an hour. Unwrapping her scarf she threw it onto the bed with a sigh. Turning around she picked up her bag and opened it. Reaching in she pulled out her lightsaber. Her tunic would be long and loose enough to hide it, but sitting down would expose it. Lifting up the hem of her shirt she clipped it securely to her belt. Much better. A knock came from the door, and she closed her bag, “Come in,” she called. A guard opened the door and a short figure walked in, wearing a red cloak, with the hood pulled over her eyes. Anna knew exactly who she was though. Waving a dainty hand to the guard, Andola pulled back her hood the second the door was closed. Anna bowed, “Your Highness,” she said softly. “I apologize for keeping you waiting. Having an entire entourage accompany me here, would have only drawn more attention.” Anna crossed her arms and nodded, “What do you need me to do?” Andola tilted her head, “Straight to business then?” Walking past the Jedi she went to the window and closed the curtain, “Tomorrow night I will be hosting several diplomats. Their support would mean secured trade routes for my people.” She turned around and clasped her hands in front of her, “I need you to make sure they vote in my favor.” “Alright.” The Queen looked at her in surprise, “No arguments? I thought you would accuse me of corruption.” “My opinions don’t matter,” Anna said, her face remaining impassive. “Hmmm.” Andola raised an eyebrow. She took a step forward, “I thought we would introduce you as a representative of my families’ mining corporation.” Anna looked down, Better trade routes, better profits . She shook her head and stopped the woman, “Can you get me on your security team, or perhaps I could stand in for a handmaiden? Someone who is always with you, but goes unnoticed.” Andola thought for a moment, “Yes, I believe I can. A new handmaiden would attract attention, especially since you have no family to support you, but a body guard can follow me anywhere.” “Good, then there’s no need for me to interact with them.” “Won’t you need to speak with them?” The young queen wiggled her fingers in the air. “A mind trick is simply opening the pathways, making it easy for suggestion to take hold. I can do that while you tell them what you want them to do.” Andola pulled up her hood and went to the door, before leaving she glanced at Anna once more and smiled, “I think we’ll make a good team, Miss Dameron .” ****************************************************************************** “You need to eat something,” Rey said as she put her feet on the console. She slurped up a fork full of hot noodles. “I’m fine,” Ben said as he ran through the computer hard drives. With a sigh he pushed away, “They’re wiped clean. There’s no way of knowing if she really did send the distress signal.” He turned around and met Luke’s gaze, “It you’d just let me---.” “No, Ben.” The Jedi Master sat in front of the girl. She’d passed out soon after Luke and Rey had returned. Ben crossed his arms and muttered, “You’re just keeping us in the dark.” Luke started to speak when the perimeter sensors went off. Ben turned around and pulled up the corresponding camera. “Is that?” Rey asked. A tall figure in Mandalorian armor stood at the estate entrance. Luke cleared his throat and put a hand on both of their shoulders, “Kids, meet the most feared bounty hunter in the galaxy, Boba Fett.” ****************************************************************************** “Thank you,” Anna whispered as she looked in the mirror. She was dressed in a red guard’s uniform, her hair bunched up beneath a Captain’s hat. It was regal, and professional, but most importantly it was just loose enough she could hide her lightsaber beneath the jacket, among other things no one else needed to know about. A knock came from the door, “Come in,” she said turning around. Ashesla poked his face in and looked her up and down in surprise, “Well, you certainly look the part. Red suits you.” Anna nodded her head and adjusted her gloves, “Thanks. Are we ready?” The lieutenant held the door open, “They’re waiting.” With a silent prayer she followed him out the door and into the hallway. As they rounded the corner they were met by another officer, in the same uniform Ashesla and Anna were wearing. The man held out his hand, “Commander Rel, queen’s security detail.” “Rey Dameron,” Anna replied giving his hand a firm shake. As they walked down the hall, Rel filled her in. “You and Lieutenant Ashesla will be accompanying her Highness throughout the proceedings. You stay quiet, and keep an eye out. Your shift will be changed once Queen Andola has had a chance to speak with the first half of the guests.” “Only half?” Anna asked. Ashesla cleared his throat, “The first half are key to ensuring the Queen’s proposal goes through tomorrow.” Rel held a hand out and stopped Anna. She flinched as his hand pressed against her stomach. He gave her an odd look as she stepped back from his palm. She looked past him. Coming down the stairs was the royal procession. Dressed in a dark burgundy ball gown, Queen Andola strode elegantly down the staircase. Once she reached the bottom she turned and Anna bowed along with the two officers beside her. The queen turned to Rel, “Is all in order?” she asked her eyes scanning Anna’s face. “Yes, Your Highness.” Andola smiled and turned to enter the throne room, “Shall we?” she asked as Anna and Ashesla took their spots behind her. With a loud groan the doors opened and they proceeded down the carpet and into the hall. The Queen spent a good five minutes of bowing, curtseying, and greeting they finally made it to the throne. Taking her seat, Andola plastered a smile on her face and welcomed her guests. “My Lords, Ladies, and Members of the Senate,” she said loudly as she glanced around the room, “My Government's overriding priority is to ensure the stability of the Naboo’s economy during galactic strife. My Government is committed to helping families and businesses through difficult times.” Raising her hand she motioned to a group in front of her and gave a polite nod, “The strength of the financial sector is vital to the future vibrancy of the economy. Therefore, legislation will continue to be taken forward to ensure fairer and more secure protection for trade and to improve the resilience of the financial sector.” Many people around the audience began to clap. Anna scanned the crowd. The group of men the Queen had nodded to, stood stock still as everyone else applauded. The young Jedi would bet anything that those were the ones she needed to trick. As the Queen’s speech ended people began to visit around the room. Anna glanced at the Queen just as the woman began to wave her over. Silently, Ann bent down and Andola spoke in her ear, “Are you ready?” “Yes, milady.” With Anna’s confirmation the monarch stood and began to walk down the steps. Ashesla and nodded and pulled Anna along with them. Andola held her hand out gracefully, “My dear Lord Montimer, how wonderful of you to come.” A rather pudgy man, with a face as red as Anna’s uniform spun around, “Your Highness,” he said pressing his lips to the Queen’s hand. Once he withdrew, Andola took him by the elbow and they began to walk around the room together. “I wanted to speak with you about my proposal---.” “I’m afraid, I’ve made my decision,” the man interrupted her. Anna tried not to wince at the glare the Queen sent her way. Gritting her teeth, and clenching her hands behind her back, she focused on the man. She prodded against his mind, searching for a weak spot, There! Summoning her power she pushed, and watched as he came under her influence. Andola raised an eyebrow as the man’s posture unconsciously straightened, “You will vote in my favor,” she whispered in the man’s ear. With hazy eyes, Montimer turner and looked at the Queen, “ I will vote in your favor.” Cementing the idea in his mind Anna withdrew from him. The man blinked and looked around as Andola turned to Anna and Ashesla. With a smile she led them to her next target, “One down, eight more to go.” *************************************************************************** Ben watched from a dark corner of the room as the bounty hunter knelt next to the girl. A deep, accented voice spoke as Boba Fett tried to wake her up, “Mirta?” The man cupped her chin and forced her face up, but she wouldn’t wake. Ben smirked, that was the thing about Force sleeps, it took forever to wake up a victim. The helmet turned and faced him, and before he could say anything Fett was shooting at him. Vnnnnnn . With a quick flick of his wrist, Ben blocked the shots. Fett reached down to his thigh and pulled out a thermal detonator. With his thumb, he punched down on the button and the device began to beep. Ben stepped into the light and held out one hand, “I just want to talk.” “Is that why you knocked my granddaughter unconscious and destroyed my home?” the man said from beneath the helm. “You’re a hard man to track down,” Ben said with a shrug, “I just need you to listen. If you don’t like the deal, then you can blow us all up.” Boba stood there for a few seconds as the detonator beeps sped up. Without a word he pressed the button once more and it stopped, “You’ve got two minutes. Then you’re dead.” Ben nodded, “You were hired, by the Resistance a few weeks ago.” “You want the bounty for yourself,” the hunter said ready to detonate the bomb in his hand. “I want to hire you instead.” Fett chuckled, “You can’t afford me kid.” A voice spoke behind the bounty hunter as Luke entered the light, “But I can.” He activated his own lightsaber. “I think I can take two Jedi.” “But do you want to? I will pay a bonus of 20,000 credits, if you just give us all of your information,” Luke said. “It’s a good deal. More money, and you don’t have to fight the three of us.” “Three?” Rey dropped down from the walkway above them, and pointed a gun at him, “I’d take the deal,” she said. Fett looked down at Mirta, the girl tied to the chair, “I want 50,000 extra credits or no deal.” ****************************************************************************** “I will do as you have asked,” the last man’s voice droned. Anna sighed as he walked away. She was surprised at just how easy it had been to influence everyone. Before she would have been a quivering mess on the floor. Shaking her head, she looked at herself in one of the windows reflecting back at her, I feel fine. Andola stepped in front of her. “Excellent work, Miss Dameron.” She waved to Rel who stood by the door. Another two guards came and took their spot. Before the Queen disappeared she smiled at Ashesla who stood next to her, “Enjoy the party.” Anna tried to leave but Rel blocked her path, “Her highness would like you to stay, in case she should need you.” With a nod Anna escaped the room and went out on the balcony. It was empty and the sound of water rushing down river, almost drowned at the sound of the party. Taking off her hat she set it to the side and leaned against the hand rail and looked up at the starry sky. “Do you mind if I join you?” Ashesla’s voice asked from behind her. He held two wine glasses and he walked over to her, holding one out for her. She almost took it, then pulled her hand back, “Sorry. I don’t drink.” He studied her for a second then set it to the side, “My cousin was quite impressed with your abilities tonight.” Anna frowned, “Your cousin?” “Queen Andola. I was a part of the guard before she was elected,” he added hastily. “So, you’ve worked hard for your rank then, lieutenant.” Anna said quietly. “Call me, Jon.” Anna gave a half-smile, “Jon. I’m Anna.” Jon laughed. “What is it?” she asked. He shook his head, “It’s just not very legendary is it?” She narrowed her eyes, “What would you prefer? Obi-wan?” She turned back to the edge of the balcony as he laughed. “Hey, I’m sorry,” Jon said grabbing her by the shoulder and pulling her back. Anna lost her footing and stumbled into his chest with a gasp. Big hands caught her and she looked up as he looked down at her. Slowly he started to lean forward, closing his eyes. With a grunt, Anna pushed him away. Jon looked at her shocked as he caught his balance. Eyes-wide, Anna picked up her hat and walked past him without a word. “Hey, wait,” he called after her as she reentered the ballroom. Fixing her hat she stalked towards the door, but Rel stopped her. “I told you---.” Anna waved a hand in front of him, “Let. Me. Out.” The Commander turned to his men, “Let her out.” The noise of the music muffled as she started down the steps, “Anna, wait!” She stopped as Jon stepped in front of her, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you or---.” She stared down at him and whispered as something dark twisted in her gut, “Forget me, I’m not the girl for you.” Jon blinked and stared at her blankly, “You’re not the girl for me,” he repeated in the same droning voice as every target she had influence that night. Anna stared at him as he shook his head and backed away from her, “I’m sorry, Captain, have we met before?” he asked. Anna ran past him down the stairs. When she got to her suite she opened the door and slammed it closed behind her. Leaning against the door she slid to the ground staring at her shaking hands. She had not even tried to influence Jon. She did not even know she was doing it. Covering her face she rocked back and forth. Control it. Don’t lose control. Not again. Her mind flashed back to that night in Ben’s cell. She lets out a groan of pain, and presses a hand to her chest. Something, sharp and powerful builds up within her, begging for release. “Don’t touch me!” She just wants to stay with Ben. Her body is weak, but she feels more powerful, more connected to the Force than ever before. She doesn’t realize she’s using that power until the guard let’s out a yell, as his feet leave the ground, “What the---?” he asks in pure terror, before his body soars back, and he collides with the cell door, head first. An ear shattering crack echoes off the stone walls as the guard falls to the ground, his neck bent at a sharp, unnatural angle. She stares at the corpse in horror, and feels the power slowly sapping away. Darkness overtakes her. Anna shutters on the floor as she remembers that night. She lets out a whispering breath, “What’s happening to me?” *************************************************************************** “Naboo?” Ben asks, as he and Luke question the bounty hunter. “Why would she go there? They’re allies of the Resistance.” Luke shook his head, “I don’t know, but something must be wrong if they haven’t turned her over to your mother yet.” Fett looked between them, “I have a deal with an officer there, he's part of the guard and the Queen's cousin. He paid an extra 20,000 creds. They want to keep the Jedi there for two voting sessions. One is today. The next is three months from now. Then they’ll hand her over to me.” “Why would they want---?” Ben asked. He glanced at Luke, “A Jedi would be handy if you needed to control a voting session.” “Where are they keeping her?” Luke asked, turning back to Fett. “Lakefront estate to the north. Belongs to the Queen’s family.” Rey spoke up, “We can’t get onto Naboo, though. You have to have passes and papers, or a royal code.” Luke chuckled, “I can get us there, but once they know we’re looking to take her, they won’t let us see her.” Ben narrowed his eyes, “I never liked asking for permission.” ****************************************************************************** General Hux marched onto the bridge, his jaw set, and his gaze cutting into every soul that dared to look his way. A lowly captain fell into step with him, “General we have new information on the Jedi.” He cut his eyes at the man and held his hand out as the marched. A second of hesitation later, and the man was placing a data pad in his palm, with coordinates, photos, and video of the woman. Hux flipped through the data, taking note of the planet and system, “Where did you get this?” “Queen Andola held a gala 25 hours ago. The Jedi was seen accompanying her by one of our spies.” Hux handed the captain back the data file, “Set a course for Naboo, and have Captain Phasma prepare her men. I want the woman taken alive.” “Yes, General.” ************************************************************************* Ashesla did not accompany her on the flight back to the country. Andola said that curiously, he had no idea who Anna was or why she was even there. Hugging her stomach she glanced out the window as they prepared to touch down. The lake was completely frozen over and snow covered everything. She sighed and rubbed her hands together, “Well, at least it’s better than sand.” Wrapping her scarf around her neck tighter, she unbuckled herself from the seat, and picked up her bag. Without a word to anyone she walked down the ramp, and entered the house. As the door closed behind her, she heard the sound of a droid whizzing towards her. TX came barreling out of the bedroom screaming in excitement. Anna winced at the sound but chuckled, and patted him on his solar panel, “Wow, and here you said you wouldn’t miss me, lug nuts.” ********************************************************************** Anna sat curled up on the window seat looking out into the darkness. The security lights had a short range, and past that it was a black void. With a sigh she looked down at her stomach a clear curve to it as she sat down. With one hand, she pulled up her shirt and stared at it. Where her body was once hard and toned from years of strenuous training, she was turning soft and supple. And it scared her. Looking down at her stomach, the idea that this was real, that there was a baby growing within her, scared her. But not nearly as much as the fact that Ben would never be there. She was going to be alone and her child would be fatherless. A tear rolled down her cheek and she wiped it away with a laugh as more tears began to slide over her skin. She tapped her stomach with a finger, “It’s not enough that you make me sick every morning, afternoon, and evening, now I’m an emotional mess?” Boom! Anna jumped up and pulled her lightsaber to her from the table across the room. Vnnnn. Slowly she moved across the room as a guard came in, “Miss Dameron, you need to come with me.” “Why?” she asked as TX roved over to her. “We have an unknown ship inbound. They’ve taken out two of our fighters after one of our pilots fired a warning shot. They’re coming right here.” Deactivating her saber, Anna grabbed a cloak and followed him out into the commons. An erratic voice carried over the guard’s radio, “They’ve entered the South of the base, First Order---.” The channel went dead. She looked down at TX who tried to get the signal back but ended up letting out a depressed whistle. The guard was speechless and she took control, and set a hand on his shoulder. “We need to get to a ship,” she told him. Hefting his blaster he nodded and all three of them went out the door. The sound of blaster fire filled the air, smoke and fire blew through the windows of the second floor. Holding one arm over her head Anna ran down the steps, as TX used his thrusters to go down them. The voice of a Storm Trooper sounded behind them, “There she is.” Anna ducked as a volley of blaster fire came her way. The guard that was with her wasn’t as quick. With a yell he fell to the ground, but Anna kept running. Looking up the path she could see an empty fighter. She pushed herself faster. “Come on, TX!” “Freeze.” Anna came to a stop as a group of troopers stepped in her way. She tried to go left but the closed on her, quickly surrounding her. “Show us your hands,” a commando yelled. There’s too many, she thought, glancing around desperately for help or a hole in their line, but there was none. Slowly, she lifted her hands, “Get down on your knees.” She did as she was told, and a trooper came and grabbed her by the back of her neck, keeping her anchored to the ground. The cold snow chilled her legs and she shivered from the temperature and the adrenaline coursing through her system. She tried to shrug him off when an officer dressed in a black uniform stepped through the trooper’s line. Her heart threatened to beat out of her chest as she looked up at him. It was the man from the Finalizer , the one Ben fought with. The man stood above her, sneering down at her. His ginger hair was pale in the moonlight. Leaning down her grabbed her chin and forced her to look up at him, “Where is Kylo Ren?” She breathed through her nose, “I don’t know.” A hand, too hard to be flesh and bone slapped her across the face. “Where is he?” he said as she buckled over, “And don’t tell me he’s on Dantooine. That won’t work this time.” Anna gasped as pain beat through her cheek and jaw. She looked back up at him, “I. Don’t. Know. The Resistance has him.” The officer drew his hand back to slap her again but stopped. The soft sound of a ship echoed off the landscape. As they listened the sound of cannon fire drew nearer and nearer until… Boom! The ship behind them exploded and the soldiers scrambled for cover. Pushing herself off the ground Anna ran into the trees. A man’s voice screamed after her, “Stop her, get her!” Jumping over a fallen tree, she made her way down to the side of the lake. More explosions sounded behind her and she could hear the soldiers searching for her. With a tentative step, and nowhere else to go, she stepped onto the ice. Feeling it hold her weight, she ran. Fog and snow enveloped her, and she slowed down as the wind bit through her clothes. Groaning she pulled her cloak around her tighter. Screams echoed behind her off the ice. Turning around she watched as search lights cut through the fog. Then a flash of blue green light exploded forth, and a voice screamed as a light went out. Then another, and another, until only a few were left. Gasping for breath, Anna took a step backwards. The ice cracked beneath her and she stopped moving. “Anna?!” a voice carried across the wind. She wiped her face as the green light moved closer through the fog. “Ben?” she called back. Stumbling she started to run towards the voice as it continued to call for her. “Ben---ahck!” she let out a scream as the ice gave way beneath her. Frigid water chilled her to her bones. Slipping beneath the surface her body went into shock and she gasp. Instead of drawing in air, he lungs filled with ice cold water. She tried to move, but her extremities were numb to her commands. She looked up, as moonlight shone over head at the surface of the water. A dark figure blocked out the light, and she closed her eyes. Everything was numb, and she couldn’t breathe. Then she was drifting upwards, as something looped around her waist. She tried to open her eyes, to fight the darkness that called to her, but she was too weak, too cold. I’m sorry, Ben. ************************************************************************** Ben broke the surface with coughs and blustering gasps. Luke laid on his stomach reaching out, “Give me your hand.” “T-t-take h-h-er,” the man whispered, pushing Anna forward. The old Jedi master grabbed her by the back of her shirt and pulled her onto the ice as the Falcon hovered overhead. Rey ran out and helped Ben out of the water. Rey tried to pull him onto the ramp but he tried to fight her off and go to Anna “I h—have t-t-too---,” but the girl forced him into the ship. Luke rolled Anna onto her back and pressed on her chest. With gasps and coughs, he turned her head, as she expelled the water from her lungs. As soon as she was breathing, he picked her up, and started up the ramp. “LLLuke…” Anna murmured as she pressed her body against him, seeking any form of warmth. “I’ve got you,” he said as he ran into the med bay, “Rey get as many blankets as you can, and heaters, and hot pads.” With a groan Luke set her next to Ben on the couch and grabbed towels. “We need to get you both out of those clothes.” “I’m fine,” Ben said moving closer to the girl. His hands shook, but he was talking smoother. Luke started to tell him off when Rey walked back into the room with a pile of blankets, fresh clothes, and towels in her hands. Luke handed them to Ben and Rey helped Anna change into a dry robe. Together they moved to the table, wrapped in blanket upon blanket. Ben gave Luke a stiff nod as the Jedi and Rey retreated to the cockpit. A cold hand closed around his. Anna looked up at him through hooded eyes and her body trembled. “Ben,” she whispered. Putting a hand behind her head, he pulled her to his chest as she began to cry. “I’m so sorry.” His chin rested on top of her head as she sobbed, and his fingers stroked her hair, “It’s alright now,” he whispered, “They can’t keep us apart anymore.” Looking down Ben placed his fingers beneath Anna’s chin and she looked up at him. Slowly he bent down and pressed his lips against hers. Her hand left his and pushed against his chest, and she gasped for breath. With a sigh she sagged against him and leaned against him, her forehead pressing into the center of his chest. “I am never letting you out of my sight again,” he mumbled against her head. He leaned back into the chair and she followed him, too weak to sit up, “It feels like we’ve been apart for a lifetime.” Gently her hand gripped the front of his robe, “There’s something I have to tell you, Ben,” she whispered as more tears pricked at her eyes. “I didn’t know what to do. I was so scared that they’d---.” He looped an arm around her waist and rubbed her back, “Shhhh, it can wait.” With a lot of effort she picked her head up and peered into his eyes, “No, it can’t. I’ve waited too long,” Anna bit her lip as Ben brushed away her tears. “I wanted to tell you as soon as I could,” she sobbed, “But they were going to kill you and I couldn’t stay.” With a groan, Ben sat up a bit, pulling her even closer. His scar stretched as he winced from the cold. “Anna, you’re safe now. You can tell me anything.” She sniffled and looked away. A tremor wracked through her body and Ben packed more blankets around her as she stared into space. Resting against her he sighed and shrugged his shoulders as a hand trailed down the side of her face, “If you don’t want to---.” Anna pressed her fingers against his lips and stared into his eyes with determination. “I’m pregnant.” Notes: So, I ended up needing to take my mind off things, which is how this long ass chapter (for me at least) came into being. I would just like to say that for the ice scene I was shivering like all get out. Also, there are a few things in this chapter that were influenced by outside sources and I want to give them their due: Andola’s welcoming speech follow’s Queen Elizabeth’s speech to parliament a few years ago (I wasn’t sure what a queen would say in that scene so I researched a real one). Then some dialogue between Ben and Anna pays tribute to Anakin and Padme from the third prequel. I dare you to see if you can find it! :P Hope you enjoy and leave a review if you have the time! Chapter 28 : BOOK II : GREY AREA Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Anna let her hand fall from his lips as he stared at her in shock and disbelief. Unable to withstand his gaze, she turned and pressed her back against the seat behind her and crossed her arms beneath the blankets. Looking down at her lap she whispered as more tears pricked at her eyes, “Ben, please. Just say something.” She gave a gasp as he caught her by the chin and forced her to face him. She stared up at him as he bent down. Cool lips met hot ones as he gripped her by the shoulders. The second their skin came into contact she squeezed her eyes shut. Ever so slowly, one hand rose up and brushed back her hair, as his tongue slid past her lips. Anna leaned back as he pressed forward, tilting his head and deepening the kiss. As her lungs began to beg for air, she turned her head to the side and gasped for breath. Ben continued to kiss her skin as he pulled her to him wrapping his arms around her. A hot breath fell on her ear. “How long have you known?” Anna pushed him away gently and put a hand on his chest. She ran her fingers over the smooth skin of his chest where his robe fell open. Not meeting his gaze she swallowed and spoke softly, “I found out the day you were sentenced.” Ben’s right hand moved on top of hers and she looked up at him. The corners of his mouth twitched and formed a melancholy smile. His spice colored eyes peered down at her, clear and bright. With his left hand he pushed a strand of hair behind her ear, and nodded his head, finally coming to an understanding, “That’s why you left.” She bit her lip, “I wanted to tell you the second I found out…” she shook her head and looked away from him, “I panicked.” Ben’s hand caressed the nape of her neck and she glanced at him, “I was so scared, Ben.” Her hand trembled as she stroked his cheek, her thumb rubbing against the roughness of his scar, “I thought I was going to lose you, so I was going to tell the Council the truth, but then with the…” she closed her eyes, “When I found out about the baby, I just ran. I thought if they knew, they would---.” “Hey,” Ben’s fingers pressed against her chin, tilting her face back. She looked up at him as he shook his head and smiled, “We don’t have to worry about that anymore. I won’t let anyone hurt you, or our…” he trailed off as he looked down. With tentative movements and a determined expression, he reached towards her and moved the blanket wrapped around her out of the way. Anna held her breath as he placed a large hand against her stomach. They both stared as his fingers stroked the small curve of her belly, which they each knew had not been present before. With a sigh, Ben leaned forward and pressed his forehead against Anna’s keeping his hand firmly in place, “We never have to leave each other again. This is our moment, and no one can take it away from us.” ****************************************************************************** “Your men outnumbered her a hundred to one, she was in your custody, caught and secured, and you LOST her?” General Hux stood with his back straight and his hands clasped behind his back, “We were attacked. The ship that infiltrated the Finalizer opened fire on us. In the chaos, she escaped capture.” The man looked up at the hologram, “Kylo Ren was sighted. He has the woman now.” Supreme Leader Snoke snarled, “I am growing tired of your ineptitude, General Hux.” The officer motioned to the guard beside the door, “We did intercept her droid,” he said as an old astromech droid rolled down the walkway. It came to a stop beside the general. “We scanned its data banks. It seems, Supreme leader, she is with child.” The Sith Lord leaned back in his throne, obviously taken by surprise, “A child of such lineage would be strong in the Force.” Pointing down at the general, he spoke in a voice filled with darkness, “Bring them to me alive,” he ordered. Hux nodded and started to turn away, “General,” Snoke called after him, “Do not fail me again.” ***************************************************************************** Anna moaned in her sleep as Ben stared down at her. With one arm wrapped around her, he held her hand with the other. A baby? Of all the reasons he had thought of, for her disappearing so suddenly, he had neglected to think of that one. The young man shook his head as Luke walked in quietly and looked down at them. “Wouldn’t you be more comfortable in one of the bunks?” he asked sitting down across from them. Ben shook his head, keeping his eyes focused on the woman snuggling against him, “We’re fine.” Luke chuckled and leaned forward, “Did she say why she went to Naboo?” “She fell asleep before I got the chance to ask. We… had a lot to talk about.” With a nod, Luke cleared his throat and stood up, stretching his back. Rubbing his neck he started back towards the cockpit, “You should get some rest.” “Uncle?” Ben asked as he looked over at his uncle, a serious mask slipping over his face, “Did you ever… consider having children?” Luke turned around and raised an eyebrow, “What brought this on? Is this what you two were talking about?” Ben turned back to Anna and waved the man off, “Just forget I asked.” Luke sighed and leaned against the doorway, “Ben, I asked a friend of mine about settling down a few years ago. He said that having children can be terrifying. You worry that you aren’t ready, that there’s no way hell you even deserve to be a father.” The Jedi crossed his arms and looked down, “But there is nothing like holding your son or daughter for the first time.” Ben looked at the ground, “My dad told you that, didn’t he?” “Your father loved you very much. Just as much as you’re going to love and care for your child.” The young man looked up at him in surprise, “I---.” Luke laughed, “Your mother and I had a bet going on why Anna left.” Turning around he walked back to the cockpit, “I owe Leia two casks of Corellian Brandy.” Notes: Short follow up chapter. I'm going to focus on Descent into Darkness for the next few days. So, the next chapter for this fic will be posted Saturday night. Enjoy! P.S. I really tried to make the Anna/Ben scene seem genuine. Pretty much felt like crying the whole time lol. Chapter 29 : BOOK II: GREY AREA Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Anna awakened, and the warmth she instantly searched for was nowhere to be found. Blinking rapidly, Anna opened her eyes and pushed herself up on the booth she was laying on. She scanned the room but there was no sign of Ben. With a yawn she swung her legs over the edge of the padded bench and started to get up, her bare feet freezing against the surface of the cold metal floor. Trembling, she bent over to pick up one of the many blankets available to her. “You’re awake!” a voice exclaimed. Anna glanced up to find Rey striding over to her with a smile plastered on her face. She wrapped the older girl in a hug. Anna staggered back. “Um, Rey?” The girl leaned back and looked up at her, “We were all worried about you.” “How did you even find me?” Rey looked up at her, “Ben did most of it. Then Luke paid Boba Fett---.” “Boba Fett?” Anna swayed and put a hand to her forehead, letting a moan slip. Slowly she sat back down and Rey crouched down next to her, “Are you okay?” Anna let her hand fall and smiled, “Yeah,” she breathed as the dizziness disappeared. As she looked down at Rey her eyes drifted down to her hands, “I am so sorry for--- I never wanted to drag any of you into this.” Rey laughed, “I wasn’t that mad. At least until I figured out you took my lightsaber, then I pretty much volunteered. “I needed it---.” The girl pulled the weapon from her back, and smirked, “Well, I’m taking it back.” Anna chuckled, “It’s all yours. But I’d work on the crystals. The balance is wonky.” Rey rolled her eyes and looked behind her. Anna followed her gaze finding Ben watching them from across the room. Anna felt Rey put a hand on her shoulder and turned back around, “I’ll see you later,” she said. As Rey left, Ben walked over to her slowly. She gave him a small smile as he leaned against the table, crossing his arms over his chest, “Hi.” “How are you feeling?” he tested, looking down at her. “I’m fine.” Slowly she pulled herself up and reached for him, his fingers closing around her own. Flipping over her hand, he traced the lines of her palm, not meeting her gaze. “Are you sure?” Anna sighed and gripped his hands. His strokes stopped and he looked into her eyes, “I’m fine, Ben, really.” He frowned as she patted his cheek, “You look exhausted.” The man in front of her sighed, let his eyes fall closed, and placed a hand on her waist pulling her around the corner of the table until she was right in front of him. His eyes blinked open, “I didn’t sleep,” he gazed into her eyes, “I had a lot to think about.” His eyes drifted down to her midsection, and he pressed his hand against her. “I spoke with Luke. He… knows about the baby.” Anna shook her head and chuckled, “Of course he does.” Reaching up she ran her fingers through his hair, pulling him down to meet her. It was a light kiss, short and soft. Ben wrapped his arms around her waist as she turned her head, and leaned against him. Her robes rustled as she embraced him as well, “I missed you,” she whispered. A warm hand massaged the small of her back as Ben pressed his lips to her temple, “I missed you too.” “Ahem,” a voice coughed behind them. Anna tried to step back but Ben kept his hands locked in place. Together they turned around, to find Luke and Rey peering at them from the doorway. Luke walked over and sat down at the table, “We need to talk.” Ben and Anna glanced at each other. Rey perched herself on top of a stool across the room and nodded to them with a half-smile. Ben looked between them and glowered, “What’s wrong now?” he asked, keeping Anna glued to his side. Luke hung his head and clasped his hands together on top of the table, “Nothing is wrong, but now that we’ve found Anna,” he said motioning to her, as he leaned back, “We need to discuss what you two plan to do.” Anna twisted in Ben’s embrace, pressing her back to his chest as his hands hugged her around her middle, “We can’t go back to the Resistance.” The old Jedi master shook his head and glanced down, “Not yet.” Ben shifted behind her, “Then we need to find somewhere we can lie low. At least, until the baby’s born.” Anna put a hand on his as his grip tightened around her protectively. Rey jumped off her seat, “What baby?” She looked between the two of them her mouth dropping open, “You’re joking.” Anna shook her head, and Luke waved his hand in the air. “You can discuss it later,” he said motioning between the two girls, “Right now, we need to come up with a plan. The Resistance, First Order, and now the Naboo military, are searching for you. The more time we waste talking, the better chance they have of finding us.” “Where do we go?” Ben asked shaking his head, “They’ll be searching for us in every known system---.” “The Outer Rim,” Anna breathed. Luke slowly nodded his head. Ben immediately began to protest. “No,” he said. Anna turned around gripping him by the shoulders. “Ben, it’s a fresh start, no one would find us there.” “It’s exile. We would be completely alone. Except for the murderers, thieves, smugglers, and the rest of the scum this galaxy has to offer, that are already there. Not to mention more bounty hunters.” he hissed looking down at her. “As awful as you make it sound,” Luke interjected, “It is your best option.” Ben glared at his uncle, “You only say that because you aren’t going there yourself.” Anna glanced at Luke as Ben’s words rung true in her mind, “You aren’t coming, are you?” Luke sighed, “The Resistance needs me, and Rey,” he said glancing over at the girl. Slowly he turned his gaze on Ben, “They could use you too.” “No,” Anna eyes fell as Ben answered quickly. The old Jedi nodded his head, “Then we’ll take you wherever you decide to go, but then we will return.” Anna nodded as Rey stood up, “Wait, Anna’s my teacher. I should go with her.” She turned to her mentor who watched her sadly. “Rey…” “I will take over your training,” Luke said. “But---.” Anna detached herself from Ben’s side and walked over to the girl, “This is what you wanted, Rey, what you really needed.” She gazed at the girl with a melancholic expression, and shook her head from side to side, “I was never ready to teach you before, and now…” she looked away, “I don’t deserve to teach you now.” In the softening of Anna’s gaze, Rey retreated from the room. The older woman started after her, but Luke stopped her, “She’s young, she just needs some time alone.” Anna shook her head, but turned and leaned against the couch. Crossing her arms she looked at the two men across the room, “So the Outer Rim then.” Ben sat down and looked at his hands, “This is a bad idea.” “Can you come up with a better one?” Anna asked sadly. Ben stared at the table silently. Pushing back her hair, she bent down, resting her elbows against her knees. Gritting his teeth Ben slammed his hand down on the table, “Damn it.” Anna covered her face and flinched at the sound. Standing up he turned away, anger emanating from him. She stared at his back, at the taut muscles straining beneath his shirt. “It feels like everyone is against us,” he said quietly, “Even time isn’t on our side.” Anna rubbed the nape of her neck, “Ben…” He turned around, black tendrils of hair framing his cheeks, “You understand, that we would have nothing, we would know no one.” He looked forlorn, “Our child would be born on some planet most people have never even heard of. And while all of that is happening, we would be living with bounties on our heads, always wondering when they were going to find us.” Anna glanced away, “Those are good points, but you still haven’t given me a better alternative.” “I might be able to do that,” Luke said. Ben and Anna looked at him in surprise. They’d each forgotten he was there. The man shifted and held his hands open, “There’s someone you can stay with. Chewie heard she’s got a new business set up on Alaspin. It’s a waypoint for travelers. You could work for her.” Ben narrowed his eyes, “Who is it?” “A friend of your father’s.” Luke clenched his jaw as Ben looked away, “She won’t be very friendly to you, Ben, but if it means helping Han’s grandchild?” he glance over at Anna, “We can convince her.” With a sigh, Luke stood up, “Chewie needs to run some diagnostics and make some repairs. We’ll head to Alaspin tomorrow.” Anna nodded as he left them alone. Ben stood up from his seat and walked over to her with his hand held out. She looked up at him before warily taking his hand. Silently, Ben backed up, pulling her along with him. Without a word she followed him, as they walked down one of the many corridors of the ship. Ben knew exactly where he was going, and swiftly pushed her into a room. Anna laughed and sat down on one of the beds as he closed the door, “Ben, what are you---- mmmm.” Ben leaned over her, pressing his thumb to her bottom lip as he kissed her. It was heated, and probing, like all the passion inside of him was bubbling up to the surface. His fingers fisted in her hair, keeping her anchored to him. With one hand he pushed her shoulders back until she was laying on the bed and he shifted until he was resting between her legs. She looked up at him the corners of her eyes wetting as he kissed her again. Gasping for breath she turned her head to the side, “What’s gotten into you?” Ben kissed her temples as he braced himself above her, his hot breath ghosting over her skin, making her body ache, “It’s been four months since I’ve made love to you,” he murmured in her ear, “We might not get another chance like this.” Slowly, he leaned back and began to tear off her clothes. Anna sat up and grabbed his hands. “Stop,” she ordered. Ben looked at her, questioning. There was a hint of confusion in his eyes as she shook her head. The corners of her lips twitched as she leaned forward, and kissed him. She turned her head, sharing his heat, “Lock the door.” Ben smirked at her laugh, as he flicked his wrist in the air. The door locked behind them with a click, and they fell back on the bed together, their minds quickly consumed with one another. ************************************************************************** Epilogue General Hux marched into the briefing room, aboard the Auris . Everyone in the room stood as he entered, but he waved them off in annoyance, “Sit down.” Taking his own seat he turned to the screen, “Do you have the Jedi’s location yet?” The captain next to him cleared his throat, “Not as of yet, but we do have information on the Resistance.” Hux swiveled around and waited for the man to continue. The man didn’t flipped though several slides, “Our spies have located their new base.” A ice covered world appeared on the screen. Hux turned around and clasped his fingers on top of the table, “We will not allow them to escape this time. Wipe. Them. Out.” END OF BOOK II Notes: Alright, so I know they're only making two more movies, but I need to split this into a new book. This new one will be the final one because this has to end somewhere. Chapter 30 : BOOK III: A NEW BEGINNING Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) THREE MONTHS AFTER THE EVENTS OF ANNA’S ESCAPE FROM NABOO “What about Jacen?” Anna asked as she laid down next to him. Ben scrunched his nose, “No.” She maneuvered her body until she was laying in the crook of his arm, and stared up at the ceiling, “Why not? It’s a good name and I like it,” she murmured with a grin. She glanced down at her swollen stomach, as Ben pulled up the hem of her tunic and began to draw shapes over the expanse of her skin. A heavy hand fell on her head, and she tilted her head back, looking up at him with wide eyes, “You’re so sure it’s a boy?” he asked, quirking an eyebrow. “It could be a girl,” Anna shrugged, “But it’s not.” Closing her eyes she relaxed as his hand kept tracing stars and letters across her skin. Brown eyes glanced at her playfully, “It could be two, a boy and a girl. My mom and Luke were twins.” Anna glared at him, at the sheer lunacy of such a suggestion, “Ben Solo, one baby is enough.” She swatted his arm away as his shoulders shook with a laugh he was struggling to contain, “It’s not funny. I am not having twins.” “Alright, alright.” He holds a hand up in surrender. With a huff, Anna laid back down, and was silent until cool fingers grazed over her skin again and she sighed, “I’ve always liked the name,” she murmured, as she changed the subject, “There used to be a boy I played with as a child, Jacen Tamika…” she smirked as Ben’s fingers froze, “He was pretty cute.” Ben pulled his arm out from behind her head, and sat up, pushing his eyebrows together, “Well, then it’s definitely out.” Blue eyes opened and stared at him. Anna pushed herself up on her elbows and pouted playfully. “You’re no fun, you know that?” He shook his head and ran fingers through his hair, pressing his lips to her stomach, “I’m just saying, “Jacen Solo”? It doesn’t sound right. Not for us.” “So, you’re vetoing the name?” Ben sat up and nodded his head, “That is exactly…” he said as he leaned towards her face, “What I am doing.” Softly he kissed her before laying down next to her as she rolled onto her side. With a flick of his index finger he turned off the lights from across the room, and wrapped an arm around her. Her hand laid on top of his. “I love you,” she whispered as he nuzzled his face against her neck. His voice was muffled, “Love you too.” **************************************************************************** Fire rains down, and smoke, screams, and ash fill the air. With heavy footsteps he stands in the center of a wasted field, turning and turning, surrounded by bodies. The corpses are alight, mangled by fire and force. Three moons hang heavy and swollen in the night sky. Black ships fly overhead, retreating from the battle. A voice screams over the sound of the raging fires, “Ben, help me!” The plea is filled with pain and anguish, like a knife sticking in his back. His heart stops. Panic sets in, and he begins to run, listening as the cries for help continue. With a yell he stumbles over one of the bodies, falling face first into a pile of black ash and sand. Coughing and spewing pieces of debris he looks behind him, a body lays on the ground staring at him with the eyes of a dead man, an old weathered hand gripping his ankle tightly, “Uncle?” he breathes. “Go to her. Save them.” The man lets go of his leg and gasps in short breaths until his body finally stills. Panting, the other man pushes back, trying to get away as quickly as he can. Another cry of agony steals his attention. Breathing through clenched teeth, he runs. He runs over the fallen bodies, sending up plumes of ash with every step and with each stride he realizes he’s going nowhere fast. With a silent yell, he falls to his knees as his legs finally give out. Another cry pierces the night, but it is not one of agony, terror, or alarm. It is shrill, alone, and it grows closer and closer, until it sounds as though it is all around him, coming from all directions. Then it becomes muffled. He gasps as he looks up. The bodies are vanished, the stench of death is gone. He’s on a grassy plain, the wind rustling over the surface of the grass. A single tent stands before him. Gritting his teeth he stands and takes one step forward. Then another. Then another, until he finds his rhythm and is racing towards the structure. The cries grow louder the closer her gets. He reaches out and pulls back the flap and steps inside. It’s empty. ****************************************************************************** Alaspin’s moon hung high overhead as he stared across the plain. He leaned against an empty fuel wagon and crosses his arms. A cool breeze drifted by, fluttering in his hair. A door slid open behind him, “Ben?” Unfurling his arms he glanced over his shoulder, as Anna walked towards him barefoot, one hand on the crest of her stomach, and the other supporting her back. The end of her long green silk robe trailed behind her, and in the moonlight she looked ethereal. He held his breath as she walked towards him. She shivered and her hands moved to rub her bare arms as another cool breeze blew by them. Ben stood up, “You should be sleeping.” Without a word she stopped in front of him. Cool fingers grazed his cheeks and he looked her in the eye, then looked away. Anna frowned, “What’s wrong?” He sighed and looked up at the moon, “Nothing… I was just thinking.” She gave him a look of suspicion, pursing her lips, “What about?” Brown eyes slowly moved to gaze down at her and he pushed a strand of hair behind her ear, “You.” “Liar,” she said, calling his bluff, but a small smile pulled at the corners of her lips. He scoffed as though she had mortally wounded him. Taking her by the hand he led her back to the house, “It’s the truth though,” he said, sending her through the open door first, “I’m always thinking of you.” She chuckled but shook her head, and looked at him uncertainly, “Be honest, are you sure you’re alright?” Shaking his head, Ben placed his hands on either side of her face and kissed her forehead, “I’m fine,” he said, letting his hands fall. With a nod he pushed her back into the house, “Go back to sleep, I’ll be there is a minute.” Shaking her head she walked inside without any more protest, and Ben turned and leaned against the door, looking up at the moon. Images flashed before his eyes. He looks around the deserted tent, but there’s no one there, human or alien. Panting for breath he turns around and starts to leave. Then it happens. Cooing and babbling, a cherub like voice falls on his ears letting go of the tent entrance he turns around and looks down at the ground. A grass woven basket sits in the center of the tent with a white cloth bundle placed within. He steps towards it. He begins to reach out to it. The bundle moves. As it squirms he crouches down and pulls it to him, but before he can pick the basket, smoke and embers rise up from the ground. With a yell he pulls the bundle of cloth to him and stands as the tent burns away around him. Coughing, he covers his eyes as he looks around the burning plain. A myriad of voices swims through his mind. “You cannot escape. There is only death, and destruction, lest you choose passion and strength.” A cry calls up to him, and he looks down. Blue eyes stare up at him as his entire world burns around him. Notes: So, I pretty much loved writing the beginning of this chapter, cause it’s so cute (At least in my opinion). Here we go, it’s the final book. Stay tuned, hopefully it will be one hell of a ride! P.S. Please excuse my shameless nod to the expanded universe of Star Wars. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, then shame on you. You aren’t a true fan if you don’t know who, Jacen, Jaina, Tenel Ka and Lowbacca are. (But I still love you if you don’t know who they are… I guess… Nobody is perfect). P.S.S. Also I am still coming up with some baby names (Jacen is not one of them). Would you guys like to choose from my list, or input your own ideas? It may not be kosher, but I kind of like the idea of you guys getting a choice. Let me know in the comments! Chapter 31 : BOOK III: A NEW BEGINNING Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “General, if we attack now, we can wipe the Resistance from the galaxy.” Hux turned around and glared at the man, “You will proceed as I have ordered---.” “But you ordered us to wipe them out---.” “Orders change,” the ginger haired man spat, as he turned back to the map, “Attack them, but let the Jedi go.” ************************************************************************* With a sigh he glanced at the clock across the empty room, then leaned back in his chair. “Lieutenant,” the sanitation crew murmured as they swept through the room. Giving a small nod he cracked his neck and began typing into the log sheet of rogue squadron’s flight rotations from their earlier patrol. This is not what I signed up for, he thought with another annoyed glance at the clock. Lieutenant Dawes was a young man, newly promoted. He was quiet, and kept to himself, preferring the company of statistics and computers to human contact. So, when there was an opening in the command room, he had leapt at the opportunity. Logging flight time, and fuel consumption, was not his idea of a good time though. The room emptied and he was left alone to finish his work. Time passes, and he closes out the computer program. With a sigh, he leaned back and stared up at the ceiling, “Another day wasted,” he murmured. Groaning he stood up, and started for the door. Beep, beep, beep… Looking up the heavens he turned around, “What now---?” The sensor map across the room, was flashing with little red lights: ships entering the planet’s atmosphere. Dawes’ heart stopped. Beep, beep, beep… Gathering his wits and shaking his head, he ran to the control panel in the center of the room, and flipped back the lid of a large, red button. With a grunt he slammed his hand down and then all hell broke loose. ***************************************************************************** Blue screens covered the wall as Anna leaned forward in her chair and spoke into her microphone, “Can someone check out the pazzak table? The red Twi’Lek just palmed an extra game piece.” She shook her head, as one of their Rodian bouncer grabbed the alien by the shoulder, and pulled him away from the table. Leaning back in her chair she laid a hand on her stomach, “And that is why we don’t gamble,” she murmured. A knock came from the door, and she swiveled around in her chair. Ben poked his head through the doorway, “Hey, have you seen---?” “Ben Solo!” He closed his eyes and winced. Anna smirked as he turned around. A muffled reply came through the closed door, “Hey, Maz, I was just looking for you…” Shaking her head, Anna looked up at the screens in front of her, focusing on the one with Ben and the casino’s owner on it. Ben said something and Maz waved him off, as she turned down the hall. Anna turned back around in her chair, as Ben came in through the door, “What was that about?” she asked. Ben usually did his best to stay as far away from Maz as was possible. Ben pulled up a stool and sat down next to her, “Someone at the bar was looking for her,” he nodded to the screens, “Slow day?” She turned and scanned the security footage, “Just a nerf herder or two that think they can get by me. I only feel slightly useless.” “You are not useless.” She looked down as Ben stood up and kissed her on the temple, “I should get back to work before Maz notices I’m gone.” Anna smirked over her shoulder at him, “Well, we wouldn’t want that would we?” ************************************************************************* “Not this again,” Leia murmured as she stared at the screens, “How many fighters do we have left?” “Two, ma’am, but they won’t last long.” “Pull them back,” Luke said walking into the room. Leia turned around, “I’m assuming you have a plan?” she asked while raising an eyebrow. “We self-destruct, and take their ground forces with the base.” “Really, that’s your great idea?” He shrugged off his coat, “Actually, Rey came up with it.” *************************************************************************** Rey deflected the storm trooper’s shots as the civilians ran behind her, and up the ramp of the transport ship. “Go, go go!” she yelled, as she pulled a thermal detonator from a trooper’s hand. Catching it, she punched the button on it, and threw it back to him. Covering her eyes, she ducked behind a pile of crates at the grenade exploded, and troopers screamed in terror and pain. Tie fighters whizzed overhead, before exploding into a million fiery pieces. Poe’s voice yelled in her ear, “Whoo, now that’s what I call a flyby!” Finn ran up to her, in full Resistance body armor, “Are you okay?” She shook him off as she stood, “I’m fine.” The transport engines fired up behind them, and she looked over at the young man, “You need to go with them.” “What about you?” he said with a frown. “Chewie and Luke are on the Falcon. There’s some stuff I need to take care of. You know, make sure our guests get their first class welcome to our base.” Grabbing his arm, she kissed him on the cheek then took off in a run, “Get out of here, Finn.” ************************************************************************** “Debuuda is back. Can someone make sure he stays away from the bar this time?” Anna said with a sigh. No answer came back, and she followed the Klatooinians as he made his way through the crowds. “Guys, he’s a lot easier to fight when he’s sober… Hello?” “Kev’s busy, I’ll take care of it,” Ben answered. She looked up at the top center screen and watched as Ben crossed the room towards Debuuda. “Ben…” she said in warning, as she closed the channel, keeping any of the other casino personnel from listening in. “I can handle it,” he said as he looked up at the alien. With a deep breath, he laid a hand on a large shoulder. “Ouch,” Anna hissed as Ben flew back against the counter. Her stomach fluttered as she watched. A big fist swung at the young man’s head, but at the last second he ducked, and stepped behind Debuuda going down on one knee as the brown fist swung at him again. Anna yelled into the mic when he lifted a hand, “Ben don’t!” Too late. Ben waved his hand and the thug’s body relaxed. Turning around he exited the building and Ben stood in the center of the room, as all the casino patrons stared at him. He wiped his mouth and chuckled sheepishly, “I guess I showed him, huh?” The crowd behind him parted and a small figure stepped out, “You?” Anna shook her head, as Ben stared up at one of her cameras and winced as the voice called to him. Maz grabbed him and pulled him out of the room. Gritting her teeth, Anna pushed herself away from the desk and stood, turning around just as the door opened. Ben walked forward as Maz turned to close the door. Anna peered up at Ben, but he refused to meet her gaze. “Ben…” “This is the second time your boyfriend has used that trick of his---.” Anna interrupted her, and stepped in front of Maz, “I know, and he and I will talk about it. I’m sorry, but we’re still adjusting. It’s second nature…” she looked over her shoulder, but Ben still kept his eyes focused on the floor. Maz waved her hand and went to the door, “Don’t let it happen again.” She pulled on the door, and started to step out of the room, but she glanced at them at the last second, “This is as much for your protection as anything. I promised I would keep you safe, but I can’t do that if you’re going to use your powers in the center of my business.” “Thank you, Maz,” Anna said quietly. The old alien adjusted her goggles and closed the door behind her. With a sigh, Anna crossed and arm over her stomach, and pinched the bridge of her nose with the other. Slowly, she turned around, “Ben.” “I know,” he said as he sat down. “We can’t keep doing this,” she said, with a sullen glance. He shook his head and looked up at her, “Anna, I---.” “It’s not fair,” she said, sitting down next to him, “I know, but we have to try.” She took his hand in hers, and stood. “What are you doing?” Ben asked following her out the door, as she pulled on a cloak, wrapping it around herself. “Kev can handle the bar, and Maz shut down the casino once Debuuda started acting up.” She glanced at him as they walked out the door, “Let’s go home.” Ben chuckled and pulled her to his side as they exited the building. *************************************************************************************************** Rain pattered against the windows, as Anna slept soundly on the bed. Ben leaned against the counter across the room, staring at her over a glass of water. Taking one last sip, he placed the glass in the sink and slowly walked towards the bed. With a sigh he pulled his tunic over his head and threw it on the chair as he sat down next to her. She was laying on her side, with hand resting beneath her cheek, and the other laying over her stomach. Her eyes twitched as the bed creaked from his extra weight, and he placed a hot hand on her arm, stroking one of her numerous training scars with his thumb. Anna’s face scrunched up and she let out a small moan, moving her palm so that it rested on the lower side of her belly. Ben looked down through dark eyelashes, as he moved his hand down her arm, and slid his hand beneath hers. Something small, a hand or a foot moved beneath his hand and he chuckled. Anna’s hand moved on top of his and he looked up to see her giving a tired smirk through droopy eyes. “Sorry, did I wake you?” he asked. She yawned and shook her head, with a glance at the clock. Anna closed her eyes, “You should go to sleep,” she whispered. Her breathing steadied again, as she fell asleep once more. Ben chuckled and leaned over her, kissing her eyelids, “I love you,” he murmured. Then he turned off the light. Standing up, he moved to the end of the bed and started to climb in next to her. Knock-knock. He stopped. Anna instantly sat up, panic in her eyes. They looked at each other, and she started to say something but he held a finger to his lips. Silently he moved to the table next to her and reached behind it. He pulled the silver hilt of his saber out and walked to the door. Knock-knock. Anna swung her feet off the edge of the bed and watched as he slowly opened the door. The sound of rain grew louder as he peeked through the small crack. Anna stood up and leaned trying to see who it was. He glanced over at her then pulled the door completely open, “Mom?” Anna gasped as Leia stood in the doorway, soaking wet, holding onto an arm draped across her shoulder. Luke leaned against her, beneath a dripping cloak, his face deathly grey. Leia Organa stared at Ben, “Help us.” Notes: Hey guys, So you guys are wonderful and I love writing for you. Just thought I would throw that out there. Because I am using this as a learning experience for other fics, I would really appreciate any suggestions you might have for the characters, the story, or basically anything. A lot of my personal time has gone into this, and I really want it to be the best it can be. Thanks for your time!- mahana P.S. Baby names list: Aeron (Obviously male) Jax (Anna's father's name, if you don't remember) Mari (Obviously female) Tance (Another male) Asher (Either gender) Alaima (Female) Aeron was Makayla's idea, so if anyone else wants to add to the list, I will choose my favs then reveal it in the story. Try to keep them unique so they fit into the SW name styles. Chapter 32 : BOOK III: A NEW BEGINNNING Anna sat down with a groan, and Ben moved next to her, “Are you---? She kept her gaze on the man who lay asleep on the bed, and answered quickly, “I’m fine.” Leia sat on the edge of the bed staring down at her brother as Maz took care of his wounds. Anna had only glimpsed them: severe burns to his torso, though partially healed. It was a miracle that Leia had even been able to move him in such a state. Silently, Ben’s mother stood and walked over to them, taking a seat on one of the stools. Her eyes ran over Anna, and she gave a small smile. “I figured this was why you left,” she said motioning to the woman. Ben cocked his head, “Luke didn’t tell you?” “He didn’t even tell me where you were. When Luke got hurt… The last time Luke was lucid he made me swear I wouldn’t come here, but I had no choice. There was nowhere else for us to go. I had to wring it out of Chewie to even get us here.” She sighed and pushed her hair away from her face, “It was for your protection, the Resistance was still looking for you both.” Anna leaned against Ben who sat down on the armrest of her chair, “Leia, what happened? When was this? Luke’s begun to heal. Even with his powers it would take a week or so to get to this state.” “It was two weeks ago, yesterday.” She glanced over at the old Jedi, and asked a question that had been on her mind since they first opened the door, “Where is Rey?” The old woman looked up at her, “She’s dead.” Anna held her breath, and Ben looked between them, “No, she can’t be. Anna would have felt it.” Leia shook her head, “We had a plan, she had a plan. When our base was attacked---,” she looked down at her hands, wringing them together, “It went bad fast. We were down to two fighters. Only one transport made it out. Rey saw how bad it was going, and suggested that we destroy the base.” Luke moaned and they all looked to the bed, but Maz shook her head at them as she continued to treat his burns. Leia lowered her voice, “We needed to set charges, and Rey disappeared. She was supposed to meet, Luke, Chewie, and I back at the Falcon , but she never came. That’s when Luke went and tried to find her. Chewie and I circled overhead, and then---then the southern half of the base exploded. Somehow we found Luke, but there was no sign of Rey. Before we could search for her the entire base was destroyed.” Ben looked down as Anna covered her mouth holding back her sobs as tears poured down her face. Biting his cheek he pulled her to him, and she sobbed against him. Leia stood up and looked down at them. “I am so sorry, Anna. I wish there was more I could have done.” “So, now you’ll build a base here?” Ben asked as he rubbed Anna’s back. “No.” Leia turned and went to the window, “The Resistance is finished.” “That’s it then?” Ben stood up, “You’re just going to give up. After everything, Snoke wins.” His voice dropped as he said the name, like it was a curse. Anna stood up and pulled at him, “Ben, leave her---.” Leia held up her hand and Anna stopped. Slowly the old woman turned around, “There’s nothing left, Ben. We lost our second fighter in the escape. All that is left is the Falcon , Poe, and whoever made it out on the civilian transport.” Ben tore from Anna’s grasp and grabbed a coat, “Ben, where are you going?” Anna asked as he walked out the door, and into the rain. With a sigh she watched until he disappeared, then she slid the door shut. She turned around and pulled her shawl more tightly around her, “He still shuts me out.” “He’s never been good at showing his feelings,” Leia commented as she took a seat. Anna moved quietly, then sat in her chair pulling her legs beneath her. “When did you find out?” Leia asked looking straight at her. Anna frowned, and then realized what the woman was talking about, “Oh, the baby? Um, the day I left.” “I knew it,” Leia said looking over at her brother, “When he wakes up he owes me---.” “Two castes of Correlian Brandy,” Anna chuckled, “He told us, before he and Rey…” she trailed off. They both sat and watched as Luke slept. Turning around Leia looked over Anna for a moment. “How did Ben react when you told him about the baby?” Anna thought for a minute, “Better than I thought he would.” “I know what you mean,” Leia said looking up at the ceiling, “When I told Han… I was pretty sure he was going to run and never come back. But he stayed.” “Ben’s struggling,” Anna looked at the door, “This isn’t what either of us thought---he’s been working so hard, keeping us safe,” she looked down at her stomach. “Is it a boy or girl?” Anna shrugged, “We don’t know. I wanted to be surprised.” “Names?” “We’re still working on that. I like Jacen, but Ben said no.” Leia scrunched her nose, “Jacen Solo, it doesn’t---.” “Sound right.” Both women looked to the door, brown eyes staring back at them, with water dripping down a sullen pale face. “Ben, where did you go?” Anna said walking over to him with a towel. Taking it from her he wiped his face and shrugged off his coat. “We have to leave.” Leia stood up, “What do you mean?” Maz made her way over to them, quiet until now, “Your uncle is too weak. You cannot move him.” Ben held up his hand, a mess of wires in his hand, “We don’t have a choice,” he turned to Leia, “They tracked you. Hux is already on his way here.” With a thud he dropped the tracker on the floor, and grabbed Anna by the shoulders, “Get your bag, we have to go. Chewbacca’s starting the engines up now.” She stared up at him and nodded. Pulling on a coat, she reached into a cupboard and pulled out a small bag. Leia sat down, “I don’t understand. How did they do it? And how did you know---.” “You have spies in the First Order, they have spies in the Resistance,” Ben said as he walked over to the bed, “And I may have had some of those spies put a tracker or two on the ship. Dad always found them though.” He and Maz pulled back the sheets covering Luke and forced him to sit up. Even unconscious the pain was so severe, the man cried out. “I’m sorry, uncle,” Ben said as he lifted Luke over one shoulder. Turning around he met Anna’s gaze as she pulled Leia up. Her brown hair was pulled over one shoulder, and her face was pale. Ben shifted the weight on his shoulder, wincing at Luke’s moan in his ear. Maz ran to the door, as the ground began to shake. Everyone froze. All eyes looked to the ceiling as engines roared overhead. “They’re here.” Anna moved and opened the door, “I think that’s our cue.” Leia and Maz ran out the door and Ben nodded her through. “I’m right behind you,” he said. Anna pulled up her hood and took off towards the ship in the distance. The sound of explosions behind her caught her attention and she looked back just in time to see the Casino explode. “Anna, come on!” Leia yelled. She and Maz moved to the ship’s ramp, and the alien went inside. Water slapped against her skin, as she moved towards the ship. When she got to the ramp, Leia took her by the arm, and helped her inside, as Ben brought up the rear. “Stay here,” the old general said as she took off for the cockpit. With a groan, Ben set Luke down on a bunk. Gasping for breath Anna sat down slowly, letting it all out in one long heave, as Ben turned around. Quickly he ran and crouched down in front of her, as the ship’s engines fired. He pushed back her wet hair, and rubbed her chilled arms, “What’s wrong? Is it the baby?” The ship lurched as they took fire to their rear deflector shield. Ben caught a hold of Anna, keeping her from falling forward. Leia’s voice cut over the intercom, “Ben, I need you on that gun.” He looked back at the woman trembling in front of him. She pushed him away, “We’re okay, just go!” Squeezing her hand he took off down the corridor. Anna stood up shakily, using the bolted furniture as a support and walked over to the bed where Luke laid. The ship shook and she stumbled forward dropping to her knees next to him. Her hand shook as she brushed his hand and she let out a sob. Sitting up she leaned her forehead against the bed and cried. A light pressure closed around her hand and she looked up, as the lights flickered and she looked up. Blue eyes stared at her through heavy lids. Anna breathed out as she looked at him, “Luke…” Chapter 33 : BOOK III: A NEW BEGINNNING Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Ben breathed a sigh of relief as the ship went to light speed. Dragging his hand down his face, he yanked off the headset, and started up the ladder into the ship. As he stepped into the corridor, Maz came down the ladder from the other gun station. She adjusted her glasses as she hopped down and disappeared, “Nice shooting, Solo.” “Thanks?” he murmured. Shaking his head he walked into the main hold. In the corner, Anna sat on the bed, staring down at Luke. Hearing Ben’s footsteps she glanced over her shoulder at him, with red, puffy, exhausted eyes. “He woke up, for few minutes,” she whispered. Ben sighed and walked over next to her as she turned around. He laid a hand on her shoulder, and squeezed lightly, “He’ll be fine, Anna---.” “But what if he isn’t?” she turned and looked up at him the skin around her eyes glistening with tears, “What if he d-d…” she trailed off as she looked at her master’s sleeping face. “Hey,” Ben murmured pulling he up from the bed. Anna looked up at him and he ran his fingers over the tips of her hair, “You’re tired, and stressed,” he said as he placed his hands on her shoulder, “And the fact that you’re soaking wet, probably isn’t helping either.” Anna leaned forward, snuggling in his warm arms. “Are you two okay?” Leia asked from behind them. Ben glanced over his shoulder. “We’re fine.” He bent his knees and looked Anna in the eyes, “Right?” he asked. She sniffled and nodded. Taking her hand in his he led her to the corridor that led to the crew’s quarters, “You should go change. I’ll be there in a minute.” Hugging herself Anna disappeared down the hall. He turned around to find Leia smirking at him. Clearing his throat he gestured over his shoulder with his thumb, “She’s a lot more… emotional than usual.” “Well, babies tend to have that effect.” Ben chuckled and put a hand on his waist as the other raked through his hair, “I don’t even know what we’re going to do now.” Leia nodded her head and sat down at the table, “I want you to come back with me. Both of you.” “Come back?” “You were right, after everything we’ve all gone through, we can’t just give up now. Snoke will never stop hunting you.” Ben shook his head, “We can’t go back, Anna---.” “You let me worry about that,” Leia said. With a groan she stepped over to him and patted him on the cheek, “I still have some tricks up my sleeves.” With that she checked on Luke then went back to the cockpit. Turning out the overhead light, Ben made his way to the crew’s quarters. The room was dark, and once he closed the door behind him, he felt his way over to Anna’s bunk. The bed creaked beneath his add weight and Anna moaned, “Ben?” He laid and arm over her waist, “Go back to sleep.” “What did your mom want to talk about?” Ben sighed, as she sat up, “She’s reforming the Resistance.” Anna punched the bunk light overhead and frowned down at him, “Then what about us? Where will we---?” “She’s taking us with her,” Ben sat up on his elbow and looked down, “And I think we should trust her.” “Ben, I trust Leia, I don’t trust the Resistance though.” “You don’t have to. You shouldn’t, but trust me,” he said as he sat up, “We can help, I can help, I can be useful, help them fight the First Order. Make up for the mistakes I made, but I will never let anyone hurt you or Larena.” Anna’s face screwed up, “Who’s Larena?” “Umm…” Ben looked down and shrugged, “I’ve been trying to come up with a name.” “Oh.” Anna licked her lips and cocked her head, “Wasn’t Larena the girl Luke found on that mission to Bespin?” Ben leaned back and stared at the ceiling, “I thought you liked her?” “She kept looking at you like nerf meat on a grill,” Anna said with a frown. “Really?” Ben asked sitting up in surprise, “We were twelve!” Anna groaned and hit the light over their heads as she laid down. “You’ve never understood women.” “So, I guess that Larena isn’t getting on the name list?” Ben choked back a laugh as a pillow hit him smack dab in the face. **************************************************************************************************** Unknown System, Star Destroyer Auris “I want it back. Why can’t I feel it? Just give it back,” the subject plead from behind the glass. An IT-0 droid hovered next to her extracting an empty syringe. The doors hissed open and a dark cloaked figure moved inside. The young woman moved back, cowering in the corner. Blood streaked down her arms, the smell of sweat and fear hung heavy in the small cell. A heavy voice, filled with power and mystery spoke to her, “I can give it to you and so much more. But you must give me something in return.” The girl whimpered, “No.” A hand raised in the air between them. Terrorized screams echoed off of the metal walls, as her captor electrocuted her, “You will give in, even if I have to push you to the brink. You will kill Luke Skywalker.” **************************************************************************************************** “Transport 22-32-45, please verify landing instructions,” Leia said over the communication system. Chewie roared something as they entered the planet’s atmosphere. Anna leaned her head against the head rest of her chair as Ben walked in. He gave her a wordless, glance, which she answered with a nod. “General Organa, you are cleared to land. Commander Dameron and Finn are waiting for you at the landing zone.” Anna glanced at the monitor, taking in the dry desert landscape and towering land formations. Leia pointed to the starboard side of the ship, “There they are.” A massive plateau beckoned to them as Leia and Chewie took them in for the landing. After a few more minutes the ship descended and they all unbuckled. Leia stopped Ben and Anna from leaving, “Just let me do the talking.” The two glanced at one another as the older woman walked past them. Ben took Anna’s hand, “It’ll be fine.” She shook her head and exited the cockpit, “That’s what you said before---.” Ben yanked her by the hand, so she stopped and looked at him. “Do you trust me?” Anna sighed, “Yes…” Ben let go of her hand, and gave a sarcastic nod, “I can tell.” Anna caught ahold of him and he stopped. Chewbacca passed by and they moved to one side of the hall. Once the Wookie was gone Anna looked up at him. Shaking her head she looked past him as though she was staring into the future. “I do trust you, but there are so many things that can go wrong. Luke, the baby, the Resistance…us…” she finished on a whispered breath. “We are fine,” Ben assured her, stepping closer. “But you don’t know that. And now you want to go and fight---what if you don’t come back?” Ben placed both hands on the wall behind her, boxing her in, “That’s what’s bothering you? Anna, I will always come back to you---.” With a harsh thrust to the center of his chest, she pushed him away, “You’ve said that before too.” He stared at her, and before he could touch her or say anything to her she took off down the hall. “Anna,” he said, going after her. She disappeared through the opening into the main hold, and he sped up. Anna stood frozen and he almost crashed into her back, “Anna, listen to m-.” He stopped and moved in front of her, pushing her behind his back. Holding his hand out, he spoke slowly and calmly, “Lower your weapon, we’re unarmed.” Finn stared at them, a heavy duty blaster rifle in his hand. Poe stood next to him, the makings of a beard scattered across his chin. “Lower you gun, Finn,” Leia commanded stepping out from behind the two men. The young man glanced at her, “General, they’re both wanted for---.” “They were. As your superior, I am ordering you, drop the gun.” With a deep breath, he lowered the gun and stood up straight. Poe moved in front of Leia. “Ma’am, you can’t bring them into the camp---.” “I can and I will. Consider them both free to work with us. We need all the help we can get, Commander.” Poe and Finn looked at one another. “Yes, General,” they said together in unison. Anna stepped next to Ben once his body relaxed, then walked over to the bed where Luke lay. Leia filled the two soldiers in, “He needs proper medical attention, and I assume at least one of the doctors made it out?” Poe nodded as Finn glanced around, “Where’s Rey?” Notes: Uh-oh, sounds like there is trouble in paradise! I think Ben and Anna still have some issues they need to work through. And what the hell happened to Rey??????????? Also, I have posted a brand new fic, that is the replacement to Descent into Darkness (I will be deleting that one after I finish posting this note). I really felt like I wrote myself into a corner with that fic, and like Whitsky had said, it was very similar to Finding Balance. So, this new fic is more of a backstory to Kylo Ren, (It is still a romance fic) that basically tells how Ben Solo goes bad. I really like it so far, and I may make it into a series. Here is the summary: Kail Bothnati. An orphan, a victim, a thief and a street rat. She is the definition of a lost cause. A mechanic for a swoop gang in the lower city on Taris, she keeps her head on a swivel, and her mind on the swoop bikes she is in charge of. That is until two strangers come looking for the gang leader, and Kail finds herself pulled into the adventure of a lifetime. This is an odyssey of love, action, and betrayal, all centered around one girl with nothing to keep her anchored. If you like the summary, go check it out! Here is the link: Link text Chapter 34 : BOOK III: A NEW BEGINNING Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Anna glanced across the room as Leia spoke with Finn. “I’m sorry, Finn, I know you and Rey were close.” She laid a small hand on his shoulder. The man pushed the woman away and ran down the ramp pushing the medics who were coming into the ship out of his way. Crossing her arms, Anna stepped back, as the doctors examined Luke. A strong hand enveloped hers and she looked down at Ben’s gloved hand slowly gripping hers. Without a word she pulled her hand free. “Anna…” Ben murmured as she crossed the room. Quietly she said something to Leia, who gave a small nod. As the medics began to move Luke down the ramp, Ben’s mother motioned to him, “We need to go with Poe.” Ben walked with her as she disappeared through the door. With a frown he turned around when Anna did not move to follow, “You aren’t coming?” he asked. She pushed back her hair with one hand and shook her head, “I’m helping Chewie.” “With what?” Anna turned on her heel and walked towards the cockpit without giving an answer. Ben began to follow her when Leia called his name, sticking her head back inside the loading ramp door. Pulling down her breather mask she motioned for him to follow the group, “Ben, they’re waiting.” The man scowled, and shook his head, “Anna---.” “She asked if she could stay, and I said yes. Now, come on ,” Leia said waving her hand. With one last look down into the hold of the ship, Ben followed his mother down the ramp. *************************************************************************************************** Anna let out a groan as she lowered herself into one of the chairs, It feels a lot lower than it used to, she thought. Once she was sat, she turned the chair, put her feet on top of the armrest of the other chair across the aisle, and closed her eyes. Her head hurt, her back, feet, and ankles hurt, and it seemed as though almost everything else had some form of an ache. With a sigh, she pressed her thumbs to her temples and closed her eyes, massaging the skin. The ship was silent and empty as she cleared her mind. Heaving a sigh, Anna tilted her head back and stared out the window of the cockpit, her arms falling limp onto the armrests. Why did I have to say that? Why did I push him away? She asked herself, think back on her conversation with Ben. He didn’t deserve that. Sitting up, she pulled her feet back and set them on the floor, and leaned against the main console. For the first time in months, she realized, she was finally alone. Swallowing a sob, she also realized just how much she wished she wasn’t. “Auwarragh,” Chewie mewled behind her, walking into the cockpit. Sitting up she wiped her tears and turned around with a morose smile. “Hey, Chewie.” The big walking carpet cocked his head and whined. With a sigh, Anna shook her head, “I’m fine, just… tired, I guess. Did they get to the transport yet?” *************************************************************************************************** Ben fell into step next to Maz as they jogged behind the med transport to the Resistance transport. Poe and Leia were up front next to Luke. Red sand bled in the wind, and Ben readjusted his breather. Huge clouds loomed in the distance, signs of a massive storm, heading straight for them. The transport ship, the biggest in its class, looked miniscule compared to the size of the storm. Everyone came to a stop as they waited for the ship to extend its loading ramp. Ben looked across the med transport catching Poe staring at him. The man instantly looked away with a scowl, and Ben shifted on his feet uncomfortably. He understood perfectly well, why Poe was staring at him. “The Resistance will not be intimidated.” Ben wrapped his robe around his torso tighter. What was he supposed to say? Sorry I gave orders to have you tortured and when that didn’t work, I personally ripped the information from you mind, whilst putting you through the worst pain imaginable. Ben glanced up as the blast doors opened slowly. Wind swept up the sand around their feet and everyone started up the ramp. Once they were inside, with the doors closed, they all took off their breathers. A medic crouched next to Luke, “We need to get him to the med-bay now.” Leia started to follow them but Poe caught ahold of her arm, “Ma’am we need to debrief you.” Maz threw her hands up in the air, “I’ll go with him.” The old alien tossed her respirator to a medic and trudged down the hall behind the gurney. “Ben?” Leia called behind him. He turned around, Poe and the old woman standing by one of several corridors. Silently he moved towards them, staying behind them as they walked. “It’s been a long couple of days here, ma’am. The entire council was wiped out when the Kruvenski went down. The highest in command after you is---.” “Captain Ara’ve,” Leia said with a scowl. Poe nodded his head, “He had us set up in a few days. They’re discussing plans to disperse our civilians, then the rest of the Resistance.” Leia looked around the conference room as all eyes turned to stare at them, “Well, we’ll just have to put a stop to that, now won’t we?” **************************************************************************************************** Small tremors pulsed through the ships as high speed winds blew around them. Sand blocked all the windows, and Chewie grumbled about having to clean the engine oscillators once the storm passed. The others had been gone for a few hours, and Anna doubted they would make it back tonight, with how had the wind was blowing. Anna crouched down next to the hyper drive with a sigh, “Why is it always the motivator?” Chewie had given her a short list of things she could do on her own. The first one had been going through the computers and finding if there were any immediate issues. In the end, all she had found was a lapse in the ignition time of the ship’s hyper drive. Unscrewing the cover off the control panel, Anna plugged into the machine’s mini-computer. Once she had the data, Chewie could fix it. “Bwaragh?” Chewbacca asked sticking his head through the door. “I just got started, Chewie, give a girl a break,” she teased. The Wookie shook his head, “Brawarab.” Slowly standing she wiped her hands on a rag, and asked sarcastically, “What’s that, Chewie? Ben’s still on the transport and wants to talk through the comms?” Chewie leveled her with a look that read, “ Isn’t that what I just said?” Rolling her eyes, Anna walked past the fur ball and patted him on the shoulder, “I’ll be back. And do not touch that motivator while I am gone. I want to try something.” Anna moved through the ship, until she was in the cockpit. Closing the door behind her she settled in the pilot’s chair, the sound of sand constantly scattering across the windows, created a sort of white noise. Picking up a head set, she push them over her ears, readjusted the mike, flipped a switch, and then settled back in the chair. “Ben?” His voice was low and smooth, and slightly disconnected as it came through the earpiece, “Hey.” Anna narrowed her eyes as she stared out the window, “What’s wrong?” Ben sighed, “Nothing’s wrong,” he said slowly, “It’s just been a long day.” “How’s Luke?” “He’s fine. Mom went to check on him just now. I thought I’d check on you before I went down.” “Well, we haven’t blown away yet,” she joked as she leaned forward. Cupping her hands she leaned against the console, and tried to see through the sand storm. A small smile graced her lips as Ben chuckled, “Yeah, although I’m pretty sure, Chewie must be upset that he’ll have to scrub the engines tomorrow,” he said. “Yeah, he is,” Anna laughed. Ben laughed with her and she felt her body relax. Eventually she stopped giggling, and listened for a moment, but there was no sound. “Ben?” “I’m still here. I… Anna?” “Hmmm?” “Are you alright?” Anna covered her mouth and stared down at the console for a moment, “No, yes… I don’t know,” she finally sighed. The line was silent and she spoke quickly into the mike, “Ben, I’m sorry I pushed you away like that. I just---I needed some time to think and some time alone.” “That’s not the problem, Anna. I just---.” “What is it?” “I feel like you’re shutting me out again.” “Ben, I’m not going anywhere.” “I know. Hah--- I just think you’re keeping something from me.” Anna bit her lip and rubbed her hands together, “You should go check on Luke,” she said, “I’ll see you tomorrow?” She started to take off the head set when Ben’s voice cut in again. “Wait.” Her shoulder’s fell and she leaned back in her chair again laying a hand against her stomach, “Ben---.” A rustling sound answered her, as he moved around on the other end, “There’s something I should tell you. I don’t think it should wait, and you aren’t going to like it.” “And you’re going to tell me while you’re over there, so I can’t slap you over the head, is that it?” she asked with half a smile. “Yeah,” Ben chuckled. Clearing his throat he spoke slowly searching for the right words, “Ara’ve made it off the base when the First Order attacked. After mom, he is the next officer in command. He wants to dissolve the Resistance.” Anna frowned at the sound of Ara’ve’s name, “He can’t do that!” “Not on his own. But people are scared, they don’t want to fight anymore. Not after all the times they’ve lost. “What did Leia do?” “Mom presented a plan to some officers. The Resistance needs ships. Right now, it’s just us, the transports, and a handful of damaged fighters.” His voice trailed off and Anna waited for a moment. “You suggested something…” Anna shook her head and stared up at the ceiling, her voice losing its steady pitch, “Didn’t you?” Ben spoke softly in her ear, “Anna, if the Resistance goes down, there is nothing standing in Snoke’s way. I have to help them.” “No, you don’t,” she shook her head, pushing her hair away from her face, as she scooted up to the window, “We can leave, Ben, you don’t owe them anything.” “I have to do this Anna. I’m tired of running away… And I know you are too.” Anna turned off her mic as she pressed her hands to her face. Ben continued to talk as she cried, “How could I look at you, how could I look at my own child and know that I ran away? That I chose to stay with you when I could have stopped the First Order?” Ben waited a moment for her to respond, and when he didn’t he spoke her name once more, “Anna?” Wiping her face she looked up and flipped the mic back on, “When you say it like that…” her words trailed off as she swallowed her objections, “You have to go, don’t you?” Ben’s reply was firm, “Yes.” Shaking her head, Anna leaned against the wall, with a shrug of acceptance, “What do they want you to do?” she whispered as fear settled in her gut. Ben was silent for a few seconds, “…They want me to steal a Star Destroyer.” Notes: Be a friend, leave a comment or some kudos! Chapter 35 : BOOK III: A NEW BEGINNNING Notes: Sorry I am posting irregularly. Life got kind of crazy and I had some writer's block I needed to get past. I am really excited because we only have about 6-8 chapters left! It seems like it's gone by so fast! I hope you stick around because it's about to get very interesting. (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) 3 weeks later… The red glow of Dathomir filled the viewer screens in front of the crew of two as Poe maneuvered the ship in for landing. A stiff voice came over the comms, “ Protus-1857 , please transmit your identification codes and hauling manifest.” The young pilot glanced over his shoulder, and nodded to Finn who was dressed in a black pressed uniform, “Here goes nothing.” Turning back around, he read off the docking code, and sent the list. Flipping off the mike he leaned back in his chair. “Do you think it will work?” Finn asked. Poe hunched forward as they fell into orbit, “If it doesn’t, I’m going to have a bone to pick with that son of a bitch.” “I can hear you, you know?” Ben said through their earpieces. Poe and Finn looked up at one another, “How’s the ride back there?” Finn asked, as Poe turned back to what he was good at. “It’s a little cramped.” Finn and Poe coughed, keeping their opinions to themselves, as the docking sergeant’s voice came back on, “Approved.” Poe let out a sigh of relief, then reached up and flipped a switch, “Hold on back there, and no more talking.” The two men glanced at one another as a dark shadow came over the ship. ************************************************************************************************* “How are you feeling?” Leia asked as Anna moved into the room. Luke was laid out on a bed, fresh bandages wrapped around his arms and chest. The steady beeping of the heartrate monitor stayed in rhythm with the sounds coming from his respirator. With a groan, the young woman sat next to the window, “I’m fine.” “You say that a lot.” Anna shot her eyes over at the woman, “Because I am. I’m pregnant, I’m not dead.” Leia raised an eyebrow until Anna held her palm out to her, “I am fine. Everyone keeps asking that, you, Maz, Ben…” She trailed off and shook her head. The corners of her lips fell as she stared at the floor. “He’ll be fine, Anna.” “I…know that,” the girl forced the words out, “But it’s been four days." Leia glanced at her brother, and stood up. “I should head back to the command center. Are you okay here or should I have someone else stay with him?” she asked with a nod to Luke. “I’m---,” Anna cut herself off when Leia threw an “I told you so,” look at her. Clearing her throat she leaned back in the chair, “I am perfectly capable of taking care of him, Leia.” She nodded to the bed, “Just go make sure the mission goes as planned… Because I am fine. ” Leia shook her head, and turned to the door looking up the heavens, and murmured beneath her breath, “If my grandchildren are half as stubborn as their parents, may the Force help us all.” ********************************************************************************************** “How many more of these Bacta tanks do we got to haul?” a voice asked, as the boxed up pod moved. Ben lifted his hands and pressed against the glass, steadying himself as his hiding place was pushed down the hall. “This is the last one,” another voice groaned as they set the box down. “Does this one seem heavier to you?” “You’re just tired from the other eight we’ve had to carry. Now shut up and let’s go.” Ben closed his eyes as they began to move, and he focused on the area they were in, trying to feel for any life sources, any beacons in the Force. Letting out a deep breath he bit the inside of his cheek. “The ship will be empty,” he says in front of the briefing committee, “They won’t staff a new ship until it’s been completed.” Ara’ve holds up a hand and begins to speak, “This is impossible. We don’t have the manpower to control it or even commandeer it.” “Ben, can do it,” his mother says quickly. Her eyes meet his questioning him and he gives a nod. “Before I left there were plans for a new ship, one that had the same firepower, and maneuverability. The difference between this ship and any other Star Destroyer, is that it only requires a minimal crew. It’s so simple,” he motions to the pilot that was standing on the other side of the table, “Even Poe could fly it.” The dark haired man looks up in shock, “Thanks for the vote of confidence. But you’re making it sound too simple.” Poe looked down at his hands and began to list off his objections, “You would need docking clearances, access codes, coordinates, and a full workup of the ship. Not to mention a contingency plan if the ship isn’t ready for actual space travel---.” “But we can work from that,” Leia says clapping a hand on the man’s shoulder. “And if someone recognizes him?” Ara’ve asks the room, motioning to Ben, “Or what if he defects again? Don’t think I have forgotten---.” “Alright you take this end and we’ll tip er’ over and set it over there.” Ben was torn from his thoughts as the case began to lean until he was laying on his side. Pressing a hand against the container he grit his teeth, “Damnit.” “Aaand gently set it down.” The two men placed the box on the ground, panting for breath, “Alright, let’s go see what else was on the damn manifest.” Ben laid in silence until the door clicked shut. As soon as they were gone he reached above his head, and began to push on the lid. “Let’s go,” he murmured. The lid would not budge. “Shit.” Ben hit the metal but something was blocking his exit. He needed to hurry before someone heard him. “Alright think,” he told himself. Letting out a deep breath he reached down to his belt and unhooked his saber. He turned the hilt over in his hands and shook his head, “Alright, plan B.” **************************************************************************************************** Poe leaned against the Protus’ loading ramp as the two deckhands carried the last of the bacta tanks through the sensor array, and set it on a small rover. As they walked down the hall, he glanced over at Finn, who was fiddling with the fuel station. Once the two laborers were out of sight, Poe and Finn set off down the hall. “Left,” Finn said, having memorized their route. Poe glanced behind them as they came to a stop in front of an air vent. Crouching down pulled off the grate, as Finn pulled off his fake First Order uniform and threw it in the vent. “Alright, so when you get to the hyper drive---?” “I make sure no one else is around to mess with it, for when we get going.” “And if someone is there you…” “Stun their asses.” “Good,” Poe slapped the young man on the back with a grin. Finn crouched down and started to climb in. Right before he disappeared he turned around, “You don’t think Solo will give us away do you?” “Are you kidding?” Poe asked as he put the grate back into place, “General Organa would kick his ass to hell and back.” *********************************************************************************************** “Tch,” Ben hissed as he crawled out of the capsule. Smoke filled the room, and he glanced behind him, a glowing hole marking his escape. Standing up he walked to the door, covering his mouth, and stepped into the hallway. Luckily there was no one there so he leaned against the wall and fought to catch his breath. “As soon as you’re out, you meet up with Poe on level 20, and then clear him a way to the bridge,” Leia said after the briefing, “They can’t know you’re there until the last second. Otherwise they’ll---.” “Mom.” She stops speaking and sighs, “I’m just worried.” Chuckling he walks out the door following Poe and Finn, “With any luck they won’t know we were there until we’re already gone.” Ben peered down the hallway, reading the sign beside the lifts, Level 4. Wiping his face he took off down the hall, waving his hand in front of him pushing between the metal doors. When he got closer, the doors slid open and he stopped just at the threshold as a lift whizzed up past him at high speeds. Hesitantly he stuck his head through the door and peered into the shaft. It was large, and beside the door was a maintenance ladder lit with red lights, all the way up to the top of the elevator shaft. Adjusting his gloves, Ben stepped inside and started to climb. The lift from before came whizzing down past him just a hair’s breath away from his back. Ben hugged the ladder rung he was on and looked down as the lift descended. Shaking his head, he began to climb again, “ It’s just a short climb, Ben ,” he said as he climbed, imitating his mother’ voice, “Yeah, sure it’s short. Only sixteen more levels to go. Longest fucking climb of my life.” **************************************************************************************************** Poe crouched against a maintenance cart and peered around the corner. Five armed guards stood in front of the only lift to the bridge. It was a safety precaution, and it was the only way on or off the bridge. You had to have one of the guard’s key, access code, and retina scan to get inside. Poe narrowed his eyes and moved back as the guards glanced at his hiding spot. Slowly and quietly he moved back and looked at his watch. Solo should be here by now. He glanced at the lift doors on his end of the corridor. Shifting to look back down the hallway, Poe accidentally nudged the cart and a small squeaking sound echoed through the metal lined corridor. “What was that?” one of the Stormtroopers asked. Poe glared at the ceiling as footsteps moved towards him. SCREECH. The hall went silent as the door across from Poe’s position slid open. Poe peered across the hall into the dark chasm, as a lift flew down, past the open door. A guard came into his view, the man’s back to him, staring at the elevator. Holding up his blaster, the Stormtrooper stepped over to the door and looked inside the shaft. A sudden, quickly fading scream, came from the doors as some invisible force pulled the guards inside. The other four troopers instantly moved to take aim at the door, their backs to Poe, who quietly took aim. Another scream cut out as one of the guards was dragged into the shaft, and the last three closed ranks. Gritting his teeth, Poe let off a shot, catching a guard in the back. As their ally fell to the floor the other two turned around, instantly shooting at Poe, who ducked to one side of the corridor Vmmmmm. A blue-green light burst from the armored chest of one of the guards. With a tearing sound the body fell to the ground, Ben standing over it. The remaining guard ran backwards, and shot at Ben, who blocked the shot, and threw his hand in the air. Poe stood as a low hum filled the air, and a chill settled over him. Running around the corner he came to a stop. The trooper hung in the air, gasping for air. The pilot stepped next to Ben and gripped his arm. “Solo, we need him. Let him go.” Ben relaxed his hand and the man fell to the ground, hacking. Poe stared wide eyed as the Jedi crouched down next to the man and removed the white helmet. It revealed a young man, younger than Finn, with blonde hair, “You will open the door.” “Fuck off, traitor.” Ben glanced over his shoulder, as the man continued to gasp on the floor, “That’s right, I know who you are. General Hux has been looking for you, Kylo Ren.” Standing up, Ben grabbed the man by his collar and dragged him to the locked elevator. With a grunt he thrust the man towards it, and waved his hand, “You will open the door.” Poe watched over the two men, and frowned as the guard’s body relaxed. A monotone voice answered Ben’s command, “I will open the door.” Stepping forward the young guard swiped his key, punched in his code, and then leaned in for the retina scan. As soon as he was finished the doors opened. Without another word, Ben waved his hand, and the trooper fell to the ground unconscious. Stepping over him the Jedi stood in the elevator, staring at Poe. “Are you coming?” he asked. Poe shook his head, startled, but then jogged to stand beside Ben in the lift. Once he was inside, Ben closed the doors, and the elevator began its ascent. Poe stared at the ground silently, and Ben glanced at him. “Nervous?” Poe frowned, “No.” “Good.” The commander hefted his blaster and cleared his throat as they went up another three levels. “Why didn’t you tear the information from his mind?” Poe asked. Ben raised an eyebrow and glanced at him. The pilot looked away, “Never mind, forget I asked.” He looked up at the screen, Fifteen more levels to go. “I’m sorry about---.” “You know, if we could just focus on getting out of here, without dying? That would be great.” Ben sighed and nodded his head, He’s right. The sooner we’re done here, the sooner I can get back to Anna. Both men shuffled as the doors opened, and Ben turned to Poe, nodding at the door, “Age before beauty.”’ Poe narrowed his eyes, and then ran through, Ben following closely behind. **************************************************************************************************** Anna paced back and forth, both hands supporting her back as she walked, “Leia would tell me if something was wrong, wouldn’t she?” she asked Luke who laid silently on the bed, no sign of life except for the light rise and fall of his chest. Heaving a sigh, she moved and sat on the edge of the bed. Leia had been gone for several hours, and the only one she had spoken to all day, was the nurse droid. “I wish you would wake up. I need someone to talk to who doesn’t treat me like I’m made of glass all the time,” she said sadly as she looked down at her mentor. “Ma’am?” a voice asked. Anna spun around and looked to find a young lieutenant at the door. “Yes?” “General Organa, asked me to let you know they’ve made contact with Commander Dameron. They’re on their way to the rendezvous point.” “Thank you,” Anna said with a sigh of relief. The young man gave a nod and then disappeared. Shaking her head, Anna reached down and took Luke’s hand in hers, “That’s settled. Now you need to wake up,” she whispered, “We still need you, master.” A noise from the hall grabbed her attention, and she turned slightly. “Ack!” Anna struggled as a hard fist closed around her neck, yanking her back around to face the head of the bed. Crazed blue eyes stared into hers, and a voice rasped as she struggled to breathe, “REY!” **************************************************************************************************** Unknown System, Star Destroyer Auris “The Resistance has been a thorn in my side for too long,” Snoke spat atop his throne, “But you my new student. You will bring about their extermination.” The Sith Lord lifted a gnarled finger and pointed to the figure knelt at his feet, “Arise, my apprentice. Strike them down.” Burning eyes stared up at him from beneath a cloak as black as night, “Yes, my master.” Notes: Comments and Kudos make me feel loved,wanted, and appreciated! Chapter 36 : BOOK III: A NEW BEGINNNING Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Ben stood with his hands behind his back as he waited in the hanger bay, as the Resistance’s shuttle finally docked. With a hiss the shuttle doors opened and the loading ramp extended. A group of technicians, pilots, and soldiers made their way down the ramp. Several of them glanced at Ben warily before heading further into the ship. Ben took a deep breath when he saw who was bringing up the rear. “I want this ship scrubbed of any tracking devices. First random jump to hyperspace is in one hour people,” Ara’ve yelled as his team dispersed. “Solo,” he said with a nod. Ben bowed his head, “Captain.” “I assume you’ve taken care of the crew?” “Those who are still alive have been detained. You’ll find them in the detention blocks. I would suggest removing them from the ship, before you begin your system jumps.” Ara’ve cocked his head, “We’ll keep jumping from system to system until we know the ship is clean. Could the crew have trackers on them?” “Most likely. I would start with the officers.” The Quaren began to speak but stopped when Poe and Finn came into the hanger. “Are you ready?” Poe asked. Ben gave a stiff nod to Poe and Ara’ve before starting to walk over to the other two men. “Solo,” Ara’ve called. Ben stopped and turned around, “Good job.” The young man bowed then joined Finn and Poe as they entered their shuttle. *************************************************************************************************** Leia watched with bated breath as the shuttle descended to the landing pad. A hot wind from the thrusters stirred up the sand and she turned away. Once the wind died down she turned around. Finn and Poe were the first ones out of the shuttle, greeted by mechanics and other pilots. Wringing her hands, Leia peered over the crowd and breathed a sigh of relief as Ben walked down the ramp silently. His brown eyes met hers as he scanned the crowd. With a frown he walked over to her, “Where’s Anna?” Leia sighed, “Ben, she’s alright, but…” **************************************************************************************************** Ben came to a skidding halt in front of the med bay. “Ben,” Leia hissed as she caught up with him, “Calm down, she’s---.” The young man ignored her and walked into the room. Sunlight came in through the window, and a soft beeping sound filled his ears. Anna lay on her side, her back to him. His stomach churned as he moved to her. One hand laid across her stomach, as she slept. Slowly and gently, he laid a hand on hers and sat down. Blue eyes peered up at him from beneath hooded lids. “Ben?” she whispered, her voice raspy and hollow. Slowly she turned over and he stared down at her with wide eyes. Deep bruises wrapped around her throat, black and blue. She whispered his name again, as he gripped her hand. His breathing became erratic, and he glanced up at her. “Who did this to you?” Anna sat up and winced as she pulled her hand back and tried to cover up the bruises, “Ben, I’m alright.” “Damn it, Anna!” he yelled. She jerked away from him, “You are not alright, what if---?” “Ben, calm down,” she whispered, as her heart rate monitor sped up. He glanced at her like she had slapped him. Leaning forward he brushed her hair away from her face, and trailed his fingers down the side of her face, over her jaw, and down to her neck. His voice was low and impatient, “Who did this?” Anna stared at him before her eyes went to the door. “Ben.” With a glare he stood up and turned towards the door. Leia, stared at them silently, and then closed the door behind her. Ben pointed to Anna, “You said you would keep her safe.” Leia held her hands up, trying to placate him, “I know and I am so sorry. He didn’t mean to. He was in pain.” Ben looked between the two women, “Who!?” “Luke,” both women said in unison. He started for the door, “I’m going to kill him.” “No, you aren’t. He would never hurt her on purpose, you know that. It happened two days ago,” Leia said blocking his path. He stared down at her, “Move.” A voice uttered behind him, “Ben, stop it--- ah…” Something clattered to the floor and Ben turned around to find Anna clinging to the bed, as she tried to stand. Leia gasped and he quickly ran over to the girl. Slowly he helped her back into the bed, then tried to pull back, but she refused to let go of him. “Anna…” She glanced back at Leia, “Can you leave us alone for a few minutes?” Leia nodded and left the room. As soon as she was Anna turned back to the man beside her. Reaching up she pressed her hands so that they were on either side of his face, “Listen to me,” she whispered, “It was an accident.” “He could have killed you.” “But he didn’t,” she said, as Ben gave her a desperate look. Anna leaned back and shifted her body uncomfortably. “He was in pain, Ben,” she explained, “And when he woke up, I was the first thing within reach.” He shook his head and rested a hand on her leg, “What happened?” “I was sitting next to him, and I got distracted… Luke grabbed me. I blacked out, and then I woke up here. With doctors telling me I can’t go anywhere until after the baby is born.” “That’s all you remember?” Ben asked. Anna shrugged, “He kept…” She looked off to the side as her eyes watered. Ben leaned closer, “What?” She glanced up at him, “He was screaming for Rey.” ************************************************************************************************* Anna’s face contorts as he stares down at her. Brown hair is plastered to her forehead, as her face screws up in pain, “I can’t---.” Luke’s voice fills his ears, but he can’t see him, “We need you, Ben.” The mother of his child lets out a scream, her eyes opening to stare at him, “Don’t leave, please, don’t leave,” she sobs. Her head tilts back and she lets out another cry of pain, “Not now.” Mist and smoke filled his vision, as her face faded into darkness. But her screams continued. ************************************************************************************************* Ben sat up gasping for breath. He glanced at Anna who laid beside him with her back turned. Pulling back the covers he dragged a hand down his face as he swung his legs off the edge of the bed. His breathing subsided and he looked up at the ceiling, moonlight coming in through the windows. With one last glance to the woman sleeping beside him before silently standing up and going to the door. The door closed behind him with a soft click, and he looked up and down the empty hallway. It was late so it was dimly lit, every other light shining down the corridor. A med droid passed him, before he turned after it and followed. The droid continued down the hall as Ben came to a stop in front of a room. With a hesitant hand, he pushed the door open. It was dark within, the only light coming from the windows where beams of moonlight streamed in. A haggard figure stood by the window, thin, and vulnerable. Ben looked to the left and turned the light on. Slowly his uncle turned around. “Ben, I knew you would come.” Notes: Working on the next chapter right now. It should be out tonight or early tomorrow. Chapter 37 : BOOK III: A NEW BEGINNNING Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) The young man glanced behind him, “I-I don’t really know why I’m here.” He frowned, “I should go.” “Wait.” Luke peered past him, “Is Anna…” “She’s asleep,” Ben answered quickly turning back around to face his uncle, “The medic has her on bedrest, until she has the baby. Shouldn’t be more than a few weeks.” The old Jedi used the wall as a support as he hobbled over to a chair. With a groan he sat down, “I didn’t mean to hurt her I---,” he looked down at his hands. “I know.” Luke looked up at him in surprise. Ben shrugged and crossed the room to peer out one of the windows, “I was angry. I still am, but I know that you would never hurt her. Not on purpose.” Luke nodded his head and swallowed, “Your mother said you were stealing a Star Destroyer. How did that go?” “Ara’ve has them jumping from system to system, until they’re sure the ship’s clean.” “So it’s operational?” Ben turned around and studied the old man, “Are you wanting to use it for something?” Luke leaned back in his chair, “Maybe.” “I don’t think they’d let you out of here,” Ben said with a nod to the bandages peeking out from beneath Luke’s robe, “Not until you’re done healing.” “They aren’t going to let me do anything. I’m not feeble.” Ben scoffed and shook his head, “You’re right you’re not, but you are hurt---.” “Rey’s alive, Ben.” The man stared at him as though he was crazy. Luke leaned forward, “I have to help her.” “How do you know? Mom and Chewie said there was no sign of her, that the entire base went up in smoke.” Luke stared out the window, “I found her at the center of the base setting timed charges. I helped her and we were running… running down the main corridor, when they found us. Flame troopers.” He held his bandaged hand, “They got me, but Rey fought them off.” Luke trailed off, his eyes watering and gleaming with a far-away look, as though he was reliving a memory. Ben crouched down, “What happened to her?” Luke looked down at him, “I don’t know. We were almost to the Falcon when the charges went off. The ceiling collapsed, and I could not find her. I couldn’t see, I couldn’t breathe.” Luke swallowed and set a hand on his nephew’s shoulder, “She’s alive, Ben. I can feel it.” “Uncle,” Ben murmured as he shook his head, “Anna would have felt something, a tremor, anything. Rey is dead.” “You don’t believe me.” Ben sighed, “I believe that you believe it. But I also believe that you are grieving the loss of another student.” “No!” Luke shouted, throwing his hand to the side. A small end table flew across the room, crashing into the opposite wall. The man began to pace, “I can feel her, I can hear her screams.” Ben stood as his Uncle pushed past him and went to the window. “You don’t understand. None of you do. I didn’t realize until she was gone. There was so much I should have told her.” Ben shook his head, “Luke, you aren’t making any sense.” “I have to help her.” The Jedi turned around, “You have to help me, Ben.” “Uncle…” the dark haired man cocked his head and raised his hands, “You need to rest.” Ben glanced at the door as two orderlies stuck their heads in. He waved them off, as he went to stand beside his uncle. “I’m not crazy,” Luke murmured. Ben helped the old man over to his bed. “You’re not crazy, but you are exhausted. Rest. I’ll have mom check on you tomorrow.” Ben stood still until the old man fell asleep. Then he went to the door and turned off the lights. The two orderlies stood off to the side staring at the floor. Ben spoke to them from across the hall, “Speak of this to no one.” Both men nodded their heads and he turned and started back up the hall. When he reached Anna’s room he quietly opened the door. She laid on the bed diagonally, taking over most of his spot. He smiled a bit, then worked his way back into bed. Anna’s breathing remained steady as he laid down next to her, leaning on one hand to gaze down at her, a mixture of feelings swirling in his gut. Reaching out he pressed a hand to her stomach lightly, trying not to wake her. “Where did you go?” Ben chuckled, “You wake up too easily, did you know that?” he asked looking at her. Anna turned over and snuggled against him, closing her eyes, “Yes, well, you’re the loudest Jedi I know. You would have woken Paxel with all that racket,” she murmured against his chest. Ben thought about the old historian that had worked at the Academy for a time. “Paxel was deaf.” “Exactly,” she said, and he could hear the smile and laughter in her voice. “Do you realize how much I love you?” he asked, glancing down at her. She looked up at him with tired eyes, “Of course I do. And I love you too---.” “Then marry me.” Anna’s eyes widened and she pushed herself up. Ben leaned back on the pillows, “Is that a yes then? I think I’m going to count that as a yes---.” She stared at him speechless and he sat up pushing her hair behind her ear, “Anna?” “You’re being serious?” she asked. “Of course I am,” he said as he leaned his forehead against hers, “I want to marry you.” Slowly his hands trailed up and down her sides as he stared at her, “We can do this today, or even a year from now, so long as I know that at some point, I will get to call you my wife. I love you.” **************************************************************************************************** Finn sat down at the cafeteria table and silently started digging into his rations plate. Another plate identical to his clattered next to him as Poe sat down. “Did you hear yet?” the pilot asked. “Hear what?” Finn asked between mouthfuls. “You see those two guys?” Poe asked nodding to two men from the med bay. Finn shrugged, “Well they were on call last night and overheard Luke talking about Rey.” Finn swallowed his food and pushed his plate away, finding it suddenly unappetizing. Poe shook his head and set a hand on his shoulder, “She’s alive.” Notes: Extra chapter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I accept payment in the form of visa payments, floo powder network deliveries, and first born children. Mwahahaha... I'm just kidding. You don't have to pay, because I'm a wonderful person who's just trying to finish up this damn story. One chapter closer! I cannot wait to finally be able to tag it as complete! Comment and Kudos are always welcome. ;P Chapter 38 : BOOK III: A NEW BEGINNING Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Several Days Later… It had been a peaceful few days since he had returned from the mission. Anna had been confined to her room, and Leia and Maz were their only visitors, though they were gone now. Maz was busy using her contacts to procure supplies, and Leia was busy staying in contact with Ara’ve and his crew. Ben sat across the room, flipping through data pads as Anna slept fitfully, her head thrashing back and forth every few minutes. Leaning forward in his seat, he set the data pad to the side and watched her. Anna’s face scrunched up as she turned to the side, a small groan escaping her. Quietly, Ben stood and went to the bed and sat next to her, taking her hand in his. With his free hand he reached up and swept her hair back. Anna’s hand squeezed his as he opened her eyes, and he smiled, “You were groaning in your sleep.” She leaned up on her elbows and shook her head. “Weird dreams,” she murmured, “What time is it?” Ben looked to the side, “It’s still early, the sun’s not up yet.” She closed her eyes and breathed through pursed lips, as she slowly rolled onto her side. She pressed a hand to her belly and he frowned, pushing her hair away from her forehead, “Another one?” “It’s nothing. When I go into labor, you will know,” she said as she opened one eye. He shook his head, and was about to answer back when a knock came from the door. He glanced over his shoulder, seeing Maz sticking her head through the door, and motioning with one hand. He turned back and Anna nodded her head, “Ben Solo to the rescue again.” He chuckled and leaned down placing a light kiss on her temple. “Get some sleep,” he said as he went to the door. “Mmmmmm,” she moaned in agreement. Closing the door behind him he turned to Maz, “Your mother needs you,” she said, “Your uncle has been a busy man.” He cocked his head, “What do you mean?” She waved a hand as she lead him down the hall, “You will see.” **************************************************************************************************** “We’re done hiding,” Finn said as a throng of soldiers filled the cafeteria. Several voices joined him, as Ben and Maz stood by the door. Peering over the masses, he could see Leia and her advisers standing in the center of the room surrounded. She tried to placate them, “We are not prepared to fight at this time. We need to rebuild---.” “So they can just come and destroy our base again?” someone yelled. Ben turned as the group split on the other side and Luke walked towards his sister. He stopped and said something quietly, and she gave a stiff nod, before motioning to the doorway where Maz and Ben were standing. Luke turned to Finn and nodded his head, and they followed behind them. Leia shook her head when she met Ben’s gave, and motioned for her to follow her. He fell into step beside her, “What’s going on?” “Luke wants to take the fight to the First Order.” “That’s insane. We have nothing no ships, no fleet---.” “Well, apparently someone told him about the Star Destroyer,” she said as she glanced over her shoulder. Luke bowed his head. “I’m glad you’re here, Ben, I’ve been wanting to speak with you.” Leia scoffed as she entered the board room, and her son stepped to the side of the door, letting Finn pass. Luke stopped next to him and set a hand on his shoulder, “We’ll talk after I convince your mother that I am right.” Ben shook his head as his uncle entered the room, “Good luck with that.” Without another word he followed them inside and closed the door. ********************************************************************************************** They all sat on opposite side of the table. “What do you want, Luke?” Leia asked tiredly. “A ship. Your star destroyer and a crew to man it.” “Why?” Finn shifted in his seat and clasped his hands, “We aren’t running anymore, and we’re not leaving Rey with them.” Leia shook her head, “Finn, Rey is dead---.” “No she’s not.” Everyone looked to Luke who sat with his arms crossed over his chest, his eyes staring at the table top. With a deep breath he looked up, meeting each gaze, “She’s not dead.” “Uncle,” Ben said. “It’s a suicide mission,” he growled out. “Yeah, well so was saving Rey from you,” Finn muttered with a glare. Luke leaned forward, staring into Leia’s eyes, “Look, you don’t have to believe me. Just give me the ship.” “I can’t do that, not even for you Luke.” He glanced at Finn, “You saw what happened in the cafeteria. The men are tired, morale is low. They need this, and we have enough support, Leia. I could take the ship, but I’m asking you for your assistance. Don’t make me fight you too. I will win.” Leia closed her mouth and narrowed her eyes, as she pushed her shoulders back. Looking away from Luke, she glanced at the other two men, “Out. Now.” Ben glanced across at Finn and stood. Finn hesitated but Luke waved him off, still staring at his sister. Together the two men left the room. *************************************************************************************************** “It’s been three hours,” Finn murmured as he glanced at the clock. Ben shrugged when the door opened and Leia walked out, looking exhausted. Luke walked out behind her and turned to the ex-trooper, “Get some men together, we’re leaving immediately.” Finn took off without a word and Ben stood speechless. Luke clapped a hand on his shoulder. “We need you Ben. We won’t stand a chance against Snoke without you.” He stepped away, and shook his head, “You can’t beat them, even with a star destroyer, and I can’t leave Anna, not now.” Leia sighed, “Ben, you need to do this for Anna and your child.” Ben frowned at her change of tune, “Why are you agreeing with him now?” “We won’t get another chance to run away,” Luke said. “If we sit around and wait, the First Order will destroy us, with Rey leading the way.” Ben blinked his eyes trying to understand, “Snoke turned her?” “Yes.” “How do you know this?” Luke sighed, “The Force. It shows the future to those who listen.” “Ben!” a voice yelled behind them. They all turned to find Maz running as fast as her short legs would carry her. She stopped in front of them, panting for breath. “It’s Anna.” **************************************************************************************************** “Why didn’t you come get me sooner?” he asked as Maz finished speaking. “She said not to bother you until it was---.” Ben growled and ran down the hall, pushing people out of his way, Luke and Leia both called out to him, but he paid them no heed. Blood pounded in his ears, as he ran, sliding around one corner and sprinting towards the next. When he finally reached the med-bay, he was out of breath and his hands were shaking. Footsteps catch up with him, Maz, Leia, and Luke all standing around him silently. The door opens and he holds his breath as the doctor exits. “She’s close. I’ll be back in a little while to check on her.” He walked off and Ben turned the people behind him. “Give me a minute,” he said as he went into the room. Anna was sitting on the edge of the bed, leaning on one hand while the other, was pressed to her side. She was staring up at the ceiling letting out short, rhythmic breathes. She turned towards the sound of him opening the door and let out a stuttered sigh, “I swear I’ve never seen Maz move that quick before.” He shook his head, and crouched down in front of her, “You should have sent her sooner.” “What did they want?” Ben looked down, and shook his head, taking her hand in his, “It’s not important---.” Anna grabbed him by the shoulder her face scrunching up in pain, “Holy shit!” she yelled. She rocked forward leaning against him as a contraction ran through her lower back. Leia and Luke stuck their heads in the door, “That sounds like a big one,” Leia said as she walked towards them. Anna moaned as the woman sat behind her, rubbing her back. Ben looked at his mother with a thankful look as Anna leaned against him. Cold tears fell from Anna’s face to his and he looked up. He leaned up in alarm pushing her hair out of her face, “What’s wrong? You’re okay, it’s okay.” Anna sobbed, and looked up at the ceiling, “I really, really wanted drugs!” Her shoulders shook as she cried. Ben looked behind her at his mother, confused. Leia leaned forward, still rubbing Anna’s back, “The doctor said they don’t have any pain meds. They were lost when the last transport didn’t make it,” she explained. She looked back at Anna. “Just talk to her. Give her something to focus on.” She glanced over her shoulder, “I’ll go see if I can find a nurse or someone,” she said as she stood up. Ben watched her go, his face pale and his eyes wide. She motioned to Anna with a quick flick of her risk. He turned back, “Okay, names.” Anna breathed through her nose, “What about them?” “We haven’t picked. What if it’s a girl?” “Mari.” He nodded his head and swallowed any objections, “Okay, and a boy?” “Koren Han Solo.” Ben laughed, “You still think it’s a boy.” She smiled and wiped her face, “You know me. Stubborn is my--- oooohhhhhh.” She lurched forward, and he caught her as she tried to stand. There was a knock at the door, and Ben glanced up to see the doctor striding towards them, “Alright, let’s have a look, shall we?” Anna moved back onto the bed and leia walked in and stood by her. She glanced at her son, “Your uncle wants to speak with you.” He glanced at Anna and she waved him off. “I’ll look out for her,” Leia promised. ************************************************************************************************** He walked out into the hallway and his Uncle instantly started talking to him. “The transport is ready. We need to leave.” Ben looked at him as though he was crazy, “Anna’s giving birth. I can’t leave her now.” Luke shook his head, and waved his hand in front of his nephew’s face. Stark images flashed before his eyes. Two figures battle against one another, green and red sabers clashing in the air, as a enthroned figure watches from above. “Kill him!” The green saber flies through the air, as its master is cut down. “Join the Dark side.” Ben stumbled back and gasped as luke let his hand drop. “What was that?” “The future.” The younger of the two shook his head. “You… you die?” “Probably.” Luke took a step forward, “That’s why I need you. We can’t let them win, Ben. I wouldn’t ask this of you if it weren’t life or death.” “Why now? I can’t leave---.” “Ben!!” Leia yelled as she stuck her head out of the door. He ran in after her. Anna was propped up on the bed her legs pulled up, the doctor down in front of her. “Push, push, push,” he told her. She let out a yell as she bore down. Ben grabs her hand and she squeezes it, holding him like a vice. The doctor tells her to stop and she relaxes turning her head to the side. Ben stared down at her stroking the top of her head. Brown hair is plastered to her forehead, as her face screws up in pain, “I can’t---.” “We need you, Ben.” Luke said behind him, but he doesn’t look back. Anna looked up between them, realization hitting her. She grabbed onto the front of Ben’s robes, “Don’t leave, please, don’t leave,” she sobbed. Her head tilted back and she let out another cry of pain, “Not now.” Ben’s breathing became as he looked around the room. His mother stood on the other side of the bed. They stared at one another, as Anna pushed again. Her cries were dulled as he tried to figure out what to do. He looked down as Anna collapsed again, sweat and tears running down her face. He set a hand on top of her stomach and leaned down, pressing his lips to her hair. “I love you.” He looked back up at Leia, “Take care of her.” She nodded and grabbed Anna’s hands and he turned around for the door. Anna yelled his name, but he pressed forward, refusing to look back. Because if he did, he would stay. Notes: So, I decided to post early. Let me know what you think! Chapter 39 : BOOK III: A NEW BEGINNNING Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “The Force is rippling with change. Can you sense it?” Snoke breathed as he stared down at the blue holographic projection. “Yes, my master,” came a soft reply. “The tide must move in our favor, not the Jedi’s. I want the Resistance found now. I want them crushed, the blight of their existence erased from the galaxy.” “We are close. They are weak and they will not be able to hide for long.” ************************************************************************************************** “You’re doing the right thing. It was only a matter of time before---.” Ben buckled in behind Chewie in the Milennium’s cockpit, and stared up at the ceiling as they flew out of orbit, “Don’t.” Luke glanced back at him sadly, “I’m sorry, Ben but---.” “Just don’t.” Ben glanced at the view screen as they readied to enter hyperspace, “Let’s just finish this.” Luke nodded his head, and flipped several switches over his head. Ben leaned back in his seat, his body tense as the stars drew close around them. **************************************************************************************************** “You want to do what?!” Ara’ve yelled as they all walked onto the bridge. Luke cleared his throat as Ben followed them inside, “Take the ship, and go to Tinnel IV.” “And what, pray tell, is at Tinnel IV?” The Jedi master looked at the Quarian grimly, before taking a step closer to the Captain, “The First Order Flagship and Fleet.” Ara’ve glanced at Ben, “You want us to face the entire Fleet by ourselves ?” “I want you to drop us off. Think of it as a transport service.” Luke looked between Ben and the Captain before turning on his heel and leaving the bridge. “Jedi bastard,” Ara’ve muttered. He turned to the side, and shook his head, “You’re going along with this, Solo?” “Just do what he says,” Ben replied as he spun around ready to follow Luke. “This is a suicide mission. Have you considered that?” Ara’ve received no reply as Ben disappeared down the hall. **************************************************************************************************** “BEN!” a voice, Anna’s, screamed through the Force. His chest seized and he stopped midstride, and panted for breath as pain and fear, and anger washed over him. With a hard swallow he pressed his right hand to the wall and fought for control, his eyes closing as he tried to calm down. “Ben?” Luke called down the hallway ahead of him. He glanced up to find his uncle moving towards him, concern on his face. Shaking his head, he let his hand slide down the wall and stood straight, “Anna…” Luke stopped a few feet away from him and sighed, “I know you’re worried but---.” Ben shook his head and held his hand out to stop him, “No I…” he shook his head again and looked down, “I could hear her, I felt her. She was in pain.” His uncle bowed his head in understanding, “You two are extremely close. It would make sense that you would have a connection through the Force.” “I should be there,” Ben hissed gripping his hands and grinding his teeth, “I---.” “You are doing the right thing, Ben,” Luke murmured clapping a hand on his shoulder, “Anna will understand. We’re doing what we must to protect her and thousands of other innocent lives in the galaxy, and we need you to do that.” The younger man shook his head, “I abandoned her.” Luke shook his head, “No.” He stepped away, “Then what do you call this?” Ben asked motioning to the ship surrounding them, “I left her now when I am supposed to be there !” “I understand what you’re going through---.” Ben shook his head and moved further away from the man, “ You understand? How can you possibly understand? The woman I love is in pain and I am missing the birth of my child to come play at saving the galaxy with you.” He looked his uncle up and down, “Don’t lie to me and say that you understand. You understand nothing .” Red faced and with hands balled up into fists, Ben pushed past Luke and marched down the hall without another word. **************************************************************************************************** Finn and Poe relayed all the information and plans to the group of soldiers and pilots who had convened in the hanger. “The Destroyer will drop out of hyperspace at 02:00, half a system away from the fleet,” Poe said as he controlled the holographic table, “Teams three and four will disembark and draw the enemy fighters away from the Falcon, and its escorts. These ships will board the First Order flagship.” “What about their shields?” someone yelled from the back. Ben crossed his arms as Luke joined Poe and Finn at the front of the group. “Their shields have the same system as the shields of Starkiller base. The Falcon will plot a course from Bothan intel and will board the ship.” Finn moved forward, “It will most likely be a one way trip. Anyone still on the ship after we reach the objective will have to commandeer a fighter to escape.” Everyone began chatter and move around. Luke held his hands up, “I realize that I am asking a lot from you, more than I have any right to. But we’re all here for a reason. The First Order threatens our friends and our families,” he said glancing over at Ben, “But we, the Resistance, will not be intimidated.” Notes: Heyo! Chapter 40 : BOOK III: A NEW BEGINNNING Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “Last chance to back out,” Luke murmured as he looked at the group of men convened in the main hold of the Falcon . Ben sat on the armrest of the couch, with his arms crossed as Finn, Ara’ve, and several other men looked at each other. Silently they stared back at Luke giving him a firm nod. “Very well,” he said, “We’ll leave as soon as the rest of the ships are ready.” Everyone dismissed and went their separate ways. Finn and Luke walked towards the cargo bay. Pulling up his pale hood, Ben walked to the cockpit. **************************************************************************************************** Muffled footsteps sounded behind him and he turned around, “Ara’ve gave the final warning for departure,” Luke said sitting beside him in the co-pilot’s chair. He glanced at the holo-recorder in Ben’s hands and sighed, “Message for Anna?” Ben looked down, turning the rectangle over in his hands. Setting it aside, he shook his head, “The first few minutes are for her, but the rest is for the baby…” He sighed and glanced out the window, “When people started talking about this being a suicide mission, I figured I should leave something behind. Kind of like leaving a note, I guess.” Closing his mouth he leaned forward and stared down at his hands. “This is not a suicide mission,” Luke said. Ben glanced up at him, and scoffed, “So, you like our chances?” Luke smirked, crossed his arms, shrugged, and leaned back, “Well, it’s no Death Star. But I assume you know your way around Snoke’s ship.” “Better than I should,” the younger man replied, staring at the floor with a faraway look, “It’s a labyrinth designed to trap any and all intruders.” Red lights began to flash outside the windshield and Luke turned his chair to face the controls, as Ara’ve announced their imminent arrival to the deployment coordinates, “Well, let’s hope you have more talent as a tour guide than you did with that racer back at the academy, Ben, because the faster we do this the sooner we get to go home.” With a grim smile, Luke cracked his knuckles and took control of the ship, “Hold onto your socks.” *************************************************************************************************** “Ben!” a distant voice called. Slowly he opened his eyes, the ceiling above him dark and blurry, “Ben, get up!” He turned his head to the side, a dark figure moving towards him. “Dad?” he asked shaking his head. His vision cleared as Luke knelt down next to him, blood dripping down the side of his face. He looked up and down Ben’s body, before pulling him up by the elbow. “Come on! We’ve got to move!” Ben stumbled as Luke let him out of the cockpit. Metal surrounded them gnarled and twisted, “What---?” Luke helped him duck beneath a fallen beam, “Ramming into the hanger bay from hyperspace may or may not have been my best decision.” “Chewie’s going to kill you…” Ben coughed as they moved into the main hold. A roar echoed through the hold, as the big ball of fur shoved a beam out of his way, motioning for the Jedi to follow him. The two men glanced at each other before going after them. Sparks rained down from the ceiling and they lurched forward, as they moved to the loading ramp. “Aaaaugh!” a man’s voice screamed. Coming around the corner they found the rest of their crew. Two men lay dead, crushed beneath piles of debris. Blood covering their bodies, their eyes still open lifelessly. “Over here!” Finn coughed waving them over. He was crouched beside Ara’ve, the Quarren’s left leg laying at an unnatural angle. “Shit!” the alien wheezed. Finn turned to them, “What do we do?” Luke twisted around and called to Chewbacca, “Can you fix it?” The Wookie shrugged and began rattling off a list of repairs. Luke waved his hand and turned back around. Ben looked at Luke who sighed, “You stay here, and give Chewie an hour to see what he can fix. If he can’t do it, you make a run for the nearest tie fighter, get out of here. Ben and I will distract them.” Finn shook his head, “What about Rey?” “You let us worry about that,” Luke said turning to Ben. They nodded to one another, and walked back to the loading ramp. “You ready for this?” Ben snorted, as he wiped the grime off his face as best he could and shook his head, “Isn’t it a little late to be asking me that?” Luke stared at the ramp as the door slid up slowly, “Point taken.” **************************************************************************************************** “GUAH!!!” the last of the Stormtroopers screamed as Ben brought his lightsaber down on the man’s head. Smoke filled the hallway, and Luke stepped haphazardly over the bodies of their fallen enemies. “More will come. They know we’re here now, and Snoke won’t let us just get away,” Ben told him. He pushed back his hood and led them further into the ship. Alarms blared and lights flashed. He was just about to go around a corner, when Luke pulled him back, and pressed him against the wall. They both stood silently as a small group of troopers marched down the hall past them. As their thudding footsteps faded, Ben nodded his head, and moved forward. They were at a juncture. Closing his eyes he tried to remember the way to the Bridge. “We should split up,” Luke murmured. Ben turned around and Luke pulled a transceiver from his robes and handed it to him, “We’ll cover more ground that way. Meet me back here once either of us finds Rey.” Ben nodded as his uncle took off down the hall. “Luke!” he called. The man turned around, “May the Force be with you, Uncle.” Luke smiled at him sadly, “May it be with you as well.” Turning their backs on each other they went their separate ways. **************************************************************************************************** “You’re doing so good Anna!” Leia cried as the girl screamed and pushed. “You’re almost there!” Anna collapsed back and cried. Her eyes squeezed shut and she turned her head away, “I can’t, please, Ben , I can’t. I swear I’m gonna kill him.” A small whimper tore from her throat, “God, it hurts! ” Leia smoothed back the girl’s hair back and glanced at the doctor, who gave her a stiff nod. “I know, sweetheart.” She reached up and turned Anna’s head so they were face to face, “I know it hurts, but we’re almost there. Just a little more and you’ll have that beautiful baby. Okay? But you have to keep going,” Anna shook her head, and the medic cleared his throat. “Alright, Anna, 1, 2, 3, push!” Groaning and straining she bore down. “Here hold my hand,” Leia said moving closer. “ Auuuuuuuugh!” Anna screamed at the top of her lungs. Then it happened. A small smack sounded and small cries began to fill the room. ************************************************************************************************** Ben dropped down the ladder of the elevator shaft, with a soft thud. Gripping the transceiver he lifted his hands and spoke, “Luke, I’m near the bridge. I should be able to find Rey from there.” No reply came and he repeated himself, only receiving static though. Frowning he reached into his bag and pulled out a flare. Cracking it red light filled the cavern. Burying his mouth and nose in the crook of his elbow as smoke-filled metal chamber. Crouching down, he threw the flare to the side and reached up pulling the grate away from the vent with the creaking shriek. Dusting his hands off, he picked up the flare and heaved it inside the vent, then getting on his hands and knees he climbed inside, smoke clouding his vision but the red glare of the flare beckoning him deeper within. Dull thuds sounded as the metal moved beneath his weight. He reach the end of the tunnel when the light went out. Closing his eyes he took a deep breath and turned right. He was climbing alongside the main hallway leading to the bridge, and he could hear the thundering footsteps of guards and soldiers running up and down the hall way. Eventually he reached the next grate and quietly peered out through the metal bars. Two guards stood at attention in front of the main door of the bridge. They were armed to the teeth and in black body armor. The lights of the hall were dimmed. Taking a deep breath Ben quietly pressed his back to the far wall of the vent and braced his feet against the grate. Closing his eyes and focusing, a dull hum filled the air and the screws attaching the grate to the wall creaked in defiance. With a yell the vent burst open. Scrambling out, Ben activate his saber, and struck the closest trooper in the shoulder, cutting clean through the dark armor. A yell sounded from the side, as he turned. Picking up the grate the other guard heaved it at him, but Ben held up his sword cutting through the metal. Hefting his gun, the guard let off two shots, one that hit the light above Ben’s head and the other reflecting off the blue light of the Jedi’s sword. Sparks rained down on him, and Ben covered his face with a yell. Charging forward the trooper tackled him to the ground, sending the lightsaber clattering across the metal floor. Ben looked up just as the trooper’s hard fist came down on him. Pain shot through his jaw, and he barely got his hands up in time to defend against the second blow. His hands closed around the soldier’s and he thrashed from side to side, with a primeval battle cry. They scrambled back from each other, panting and coughing. Standing up, Ben leaned against the wall, as he huffed and looked to the side. They stared at one another. Then their gazes fell to their separate weapons. The gun lying on the ground between them, and Ben’s lightsaber a few feet down the hall. They looked back at one another, daring each other to go first. With a yell the trooper lunged for his weapon, but Ben held out his hand pulling the saber to him through the Force. It activated in mid-air and spun, cutting through the soldier. The remains fell to floor in separate but equal halves of the same whole. Ben caught the saber and wiped his face, as he caught his breath. Limping forward, he grabbed the guard’s keycard and swiped it. The door to the bridge flew open. Ben frowned as he moved inside. The room was empty and dark, the stars and darkness of space evident in the observation window. “I’ve been waiting for this, for a long time Kylo Ren.” Ben turned around as a dark figure moved behind him blocking the door. Holding up his right hand the man pulled off the glove, revealing metal skin, shining in the dim light. The lights flickered, and Hux smirked at him. “That’s not who I am anymore,” Ben murmured, gripping his saber in his left hand. “Ah, yes,” Hux murmured as he looked down at a console and locked the door behind him, “The great Ben Solo has returned to the light! How happy your mother must be,” Hux shook his head and rolled his eyes, “And I hear congratulations are in order on the arrival of your firstborn.” He waved his hand at Ben dismissively, then smiled devilishly, “I must say, I didn’t think you had it in you.” “Where is Rey?” Ben seethed. Hux raised an eyebrow. “You mean your replacement? I believe she is a little busy at the moment, being the Supreme Leader’s Right Hand, and all that.” Shrugging his shoulders, he let his coat fall to the floor, and took out a vibroblade, long and sharp, “I understand he is quite pleased with her. It seems she’s more… efficient than you ever were. Though she seems to have similar daddy-issues,” he added, as he raised his sword, readying to strike. Ben shook his head, “Just tell me where she is, and I’ll let you go.” Hux cackled, “You’ll let me go? No, Lord Ren ,” he spat sarcastically, “I am going to kill you.” His eyes widened and he stared at Ben maniaclly, “You took my hand, it’s only fair.” Tilting his head, Ben shrugged nonchalantly, “Alright then. Have it your way, I was hoping you would refuse.” Vnmmmmmm. Ben shifted on the balls of his feet, flourishing his sword before rearing back and running forward. He wrapped both hands around the hilt and swung for the center of Hux’s chest, only to be stopped by the General’s blade. They slid and locked together, each pressing all their strength towards the other. Hux grit his teeth, “You know what I’m going to do once I kill you?” With a growl he pushed with all his might, sending Ben sprawling backwards. The man collided with a control console and flipped over it, as Hux cut through the screen. Ben scrambled back, and prepared himself for another attack. Holding his arms open wide, Hux laughed, “I’m going to kill her Ren, and I’m going to kill them all. I wonder if she will scream for you as she clutches that child to her chest. Or perhaps I’ll kill the whore and bring the child to Snoke, so it can follow in the footsteps of its father. No love, no parents, just a pathetic excuse for a human being.” Ben stared at him, his vison going completely red and he ran forward with a terrible ear deafening yell. He threw his hand up, and used the Force to knock the sword out of Hux’s hand. Then he tackled him. “I. Hate. You!” he yelled, with every punch to the man’s face. Memories of the pain, and torment he had gone through because of the man beneath him, filled his mind. Reaching down he wrapped his hands around Hux’s throat and squeezed. A metal hand closed around his, but Ben pulled Hux up, then slammed him back onto the floor. The man’s eyes bulged, and he choked, as Ben grit his teeth. “ I’m not that man anymore…” his own voice echoed in his ears. Eyes wide and hands shaking, Ben let him go and scrambled back, while Hux wheezed and hacked as his airway opened up again. Staring at him, Ben huffed, as the man turned over and faced him. “Why---?” Ben looked away, “Because I’m not like you anymore.” Slowly he stood up, and looked down at the man, “And I’m never going back to who I was.” Hux stood up and stared at him, hunched over, and holding his side in pain. Turning around Ben went to one of the consoles and started to pull up the ship’s schematics. The sound of something scraping behind him got his attention and he turned around just as Hux yelled and started to run towards him, his sword raised high. Holding out his hand, Ben pulled his lightsaber, and activated it as soon as it met with his open palm. Moving too fast to stop, Hux impaled himself on the sword. His eyes widened and he let go of his vibroblade, and clutched Ben’s shoulders. Ben stared into his eyes, before deactivating the sword, letting the man fall to the floor. He was dead. Swallowing, Ben turned his back and closed his eyes. Calm down. Find Rey… Looking down he typed into the computer, pulling up the security cameras at key points on the ship. There was no movement in the cell block, or the galley. The hangers were overrun, and the Falcon, was surrounded thought there was no sign of Finn or Chewie. Wiping his face, Ben focused on the innermost part of the ship, the part he was the least familiar with. Not there… No. No. No. Ben yelled and threw his fist against the console. A small beep echoed and another screen came up. Two figures battle against one another, green and red sabers clashing in the air, as a enthroned figure watches from above. Ben typed in a code, and pulled up the location: Holo Deck. His chest tightening, he turned around and looked down, Hux staring up at him lifelessly. Crouching down, he patted the corpse down, pulling a card out of the coat pocket. Rising up, he stepped over the body and went to the door. It slid open with a beep, and he stepped into the hallway, never looking back. Notes: Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!!! Two more chapters to go!!!!! Eeek I'm so stinking excited!!!! how about you guys?! Chapter 41 : BOOK III: A NEW BEGINNNING Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Run, Ben, run ! He skidded to a stop in front of a familiar door. The sound of fighting, lightsabers clashing echoed from within. Looking to the side, he waved Hux’s key card in front of the console. It flashed red, and gave a flat beep. Ben flung the card aside and flourished his saber before plunging it into the lock. Sweat dripped down his face as he cut through the door. Finally, something clicked and it flew open. Wiping his brow he went inside. The room was enormous, a large ramp wrapping around the walls, until it reached a center platform two levels above. Ben leapt back as sparks rained down from above, where two lightsabers, one green and one red, collided with the edge of the holodeck. He looked to the side and sprinted forward, flourishing his drawn sword. When he reached the top he froze for just a second. Rey and Luke stood locked together, the light burning in their eyes. Their lightsabers slid together and Luke tried to push her back. “Rey, don’t do this.” She sneered, “I’m sorry, father .” Kicking out with her foot, she knocked Luke of balance, and swiped at him with her saber. Her sword found its mark: Luke’s outstretched hand. The man screamed and clutched his hand, blood pouring through his fingers. “NO!” Ben yelled, as he ran forward. Rey turned and held out her hand, pushing him back before he could even touch her. With a yell he flew back, as an invisible force, collided with him like a huge wave of water. Groaning he skidded along the floor until his back crashed into the glass panes of the handrail surrounding the edge of the platform. Wincing, he pushed himself up and held up his sword just as Rey brought hers down on his head. He stared up at her, then rolled to the side as she pulled back and tried to swipe at him from the side. “Rey, you can stop this,” he yelled. She began to circle him, “You didn’t. I’m no different from you, Ben. I want this, just like you did.” He shook his head, “No. Rey, he’s lying to you. I know. He told you that you were too weak on your own that we betrayed you, that he can make you strong. It’s all a lie, Rey.” The girl glared at Luke, “He left me on Jakku because of you!” Ben swallowed, “I’m sorry. I would take it all back if I could, but you don’t have to do this. Killing your father won’t heal your pain. It will only deepen it. Trust me.” She sneered at him, “Yes, because you know all too well, don’t you?” With a yell she leapt forward and he pushed himself up from the floor. Finding his balance he spun around and continued on the defensive, as she continued to try to slice him to pieces. He glanced over his shoulder, a tall dark figure moving towards Luke’s position. Jumping back, Ben threw his saber at Rey letting it spin in the air. She fell to her knees and arched her back, letting the swords miss her neck by barely an inch. Then she ran at him. Pulling back on the sword Ben leapt to the side. “Luke, run!” With a yell, he fought back, and pushed at her with the Force. She did the same thing. Groaning and gritting their teeth they focused on one another, each doing their best force the other one back. Then in the spur of the moment, Ben changed tactics. Moving his hand, he pulled back and Rey let out a yell, as she was dragged across the floor, but she pushed her self away from him and fell back. With a Force pull he dropped one of the supply barrels on top of her. Then he turned and looked again, finding Luke scrambling back. He glanced at Rey finding her still laying on the floor. Then he ran. Luke stared up at the Sith Lord, unarmed and in pain. Vmmmmm. Ben ran between them throwing his sword at Snoke. The blue saber soared through the air, only to be swatted away by the seven foot figure’s gnarled hand. It flew over the edge of the platform. Ben backed up, “Luke, get out of here,” he growled as Snoke moved away from him with an evil grin. The Sith Lord sat on his throne lethargically. “I’m not---.” Ben shook his head and looked back at him, “I can do this, take Rey and go.” He twisted back and held out his hand, a silver orb, a thermal detonator glinting in his palm. “Tell, Anna, that I’m sorry.” Standing up, Luke moved as quickly as he could to Rey. Ben turned around just as Snoke began to chuckle. “So, the apprentice finally returns to the master.” Bending down, Ben picked up, Luke’s lightsaber, “Not quite. The “rule of two” never interested me.” Luke’s footsteps faded in the background and Ben drew closer to the throne. Snoke narrowed his eyes, “You are not the first to try to kill me, and you most certainly will not be the last.” **************************************************************************************************** Finn stood on the ramp of the Falcon as Luke ran into the hanger bay. Rey was slung over his shoulder, and he collapsed under her weight as he reached the bottom of the ramp. Running down to them, Finn, took Rey, and helped Luke inside. “Where’s Ben?” Luke groaned as he collapsed against the wall, as the boy set Rey on one of the bunks, “He stayed behind.” Finn turned around, just as the ship shook, the sound of an explosion thundering through the ship. Falling down, Luke gasped as his body went into shock. Finn tried to help him but he shook the boy off, “Tell Chewie… to… get us… out of here.” Notes: ***Cries pitifully*** One more chapter to go... I am so, so sorry... But Ben... Chapter 42 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) He’s dead… It’s been three days, no word, he has to be dead , Anna thought as she stared out the window. Red sand glowed in the sunlight. Her right hand shook and she looked down, at the baby asleep in her arms. With a trembling hand she ran her finger lightly over the head full of black hair and smiled sadly at the long eyelashes. “Anna?” Leia murmured sticking her head in the door. The younger woman swallowed and nodded. With a sigh, Leia moved into the room and closed the door behind her, “How are you two doing?” Anna shook her head. “Can you…?” she held out her arms and handed the child to Leia, before standing up. Sitting down on the edge of the bed, Leia cooed to her grandchild. “Yes, hello there…” Anna turned around, “You would---you would tell me, right? If something happened to him?” Leia shifted and looked at her sadly, “Anna, if I hear anything, I mean anything at all, I promise that you will be the first to hear about it.” Anna bit her lip and leaned against the window sill. “Look,” Leia said with a sigh, “When… Han died I felt it. It was like a sharp pain in the back of my skull, and a wave of sorrow that covered my entire body. You and Ben are the same way. If something happened to him, I have no doubt that you would know.” Anna swallowed as her eyes teared up. Nodding her head, she wiped her face and crossed her arms, “I would know.” “You’re exhausted, and stressed,” Leia said standing up and moving to stand next to her, “Who isn’t? But just… Be patient. Okay?” Nodding her head Anna whispered, “Okay.” “Alright, now you take this little one, and I’m going to go back to the command center, see if I can get in touch with Ara’ve.” She handed the small bundle to Anna and went to the door. “Leia?” Anna called turning around. She stared down at her baby, “Thank you.” **************************************************************************************************** The sun was down when the alarms went off. All flight personnel to the hanger bay. An automated voice echoed through the ship. Shooting up out of bed, Anna picked up the squalling child, from its cradle and went to the door. Everyone was in a panic. Quickly she grabbed a passing Lieutenant, “What’s going on?” “The Falcon is back,” he yelled over the alarm before running down hall. Shifting the baby to her shoulder, Anna ran after him. She passed medics gathering supplies, and guards running up and down the halls. Everyone was trying to get to the hanger bay. The halls were packed tight, and she did her best to move towards the door. “Anna!” she turned to the right, and saw Leia moving towards her through the crowd. Meeting her half way Anna shouted over the sound of alarms and people’s voices, “They said the Falcon was back?” “Just landed,” Leia yelled back, “Here, come with me.” Together they moved to the front of the crowd, and were let into the hanger. Anna gasped. The ship was a mess, with severe damage to its structure and engines. Leia cursed under her breath, “Han would have a heart attack.” They moved closer when the ramp opened up and Chewie came out carrying a body. “Luke,” Leia whispered running forward. Anna hung back, the cries of the child in her arms beginning to quiet down. Finn came down the ramp, helping Rey down with him. A long gash ran from her hairline, down to her jaw. There was no sign of Ben. Setting the man on a, Chewbacca stepped back, as Leia leaned down whispering something, her back to Anna. Leia straightened up as the medic transport sped away. Ba-thump, ba-thump, ba-thump. Anna stared at Leia as the woman turned around. A single tear rolled down her face, then another, and the realization struck Anna at her core, He’s gone. All the air in her lungs escaped with a hard, sorrow filled cry, and she sat down on one of the supply crates. “No, no, he can’t be--- he said he would come back, that he would always come back.” Leia stood in front of her. “I am so sorry.” She crouched down and set her hands on top of Anna’s. “NO!” she cried, “I would have felt it! I would know. He can’t be dead!” she pitched forward and sobbed against Leia’s shoulder. The older woman’s shoulder’s shook but she didn’t cry aloud. Instead she simply wrapped her arms around the girl. Her tears fell from her face onto Anna’s shoulder as they mourned together. Looking up, Leia wiped her face, “Come on, let’s get you out of here.” Taking the baby, she helped Anna stand and began to lead her from the hanger bay. Soldiers began to run past them, and they stopped. “Get in position!” someone yelled. Leia stopped a scout, “What’s going on?” “Tie fighter inbound ma’am.” He ran off and the roaring sound of an fighter passing over head, thundered through the open hanger. “Anna, let’s go, it’s not safe,” Leia said pulling her by her elbow. “No, wait,” Anna said holding her hand out. She ran towards the line of guns ready to open fire on the ship. “Anna, wait!” Leia yelled but she ignored her. A great shadow soared over the sand, and the wind picked up, kicking sand up into the air. Covering her face, Anna twisted around, as the ship touched down. A blaster let off a shot, but it simple reflected off the ship’s shields. “Hold your fire!” someone yelled. The turrets turned and pointed at the ship, as the port exit flew open. Anna moved forward, holding her breath. With their back turned a dark figure climbed out and jumped to the ground. Ben. Without a sound Anna ran forward, ignoring the yells of soldiers telling her to stand down. Standing up, Ben limped towards her, his hand pressed against his side, where blood seeped through his robes. An exhausted smile graced his lips before he fell to his knees. He held his left hand up as she collided with him, “They said you were dead,” she cried as she ran her fingers through his hair, and pressed her lips to his. They broke apart and he cupped her face, and groaned, looking down at his side. “I said I’d come back, didn’t I? Don’t say I never keep my promises,” he whispered as he sighed, tiredly, then smiled up at her, with a cracked lip. Tears ran down her face and she shook her head, and she leaned against him, pressing her forehead to his. “I’m never letting you out of my sight again,” she laughed and he chuckled as medics joined them, immediately tending to his wounds. “I’m going to hold you to that,” he said as they loaded him onto a stretcher. Anna stood beside them as they moved into the hanger, gripping his hand tightly. Ben swallowed, and looked at her with a groan as they set him on the small transport, “The baby?” Anna grinned and leaned down, just before they took him away, pressing her lips to the center of his forehead, “It’s a boy.” He let his head rest on the gurney beneath him, as spots began to cloud his vision, “A boy…” **************************************************************************************************** Epilogue Beep… beep… beep… Slowly, Ben opened his eyes the sound of a heartrate monitor echoing in the background. With a wince he sat up, a heavy heat gripping his hand. Soft sunlight came in through the gaps of the blinds over the window. With a sigh he stared at Anna, as she slept at his bed side, the sound of her soothing breaths reverberating against his skin. Groaning she opened her eyes as he moved his hand out from beneath her cheek, “Ben?” she murmured sitting up. Biting back a grimace at a twinge in his side he laid his palm on top of her hand. She shook her head and took a deep breath as she took in her surroundings, “I must have fallen asleep.” He nodded his head impatiently, “Koren,” he said and she looked at him, “Where is he?” His voice was almost pitiful, but he didn’t care. For once in his life he deserved to be pitiful. Anna’s mouth twitched, “He’s with your mother. The doctors, they wouldn’t let me bring him in until you were conscious.” Ben raised an eyebrow, “I’m conscious now,” he pointed out. Anna laughed and stood, leaning over and kissing him on the temple. “Still as patient as ever,” she whispered in his ear. Leaning back she stared at him, “Are you sure? Maybe you should rest---?” “Anna.” She stopped, as he stared at her, not in anger, but with an itching need to see his son. He looked down and chuckled as the thought struck him, My son… When he looked back up, Anna was walking through the door, soft murmurs moving in from the hallway. A few seconds later she was back, a small white cloth moving bundle in her arms. His breath caught in his throat when she looked back up at him beaming. Quietly, she sat on the edge of the bed, “He looks like you,” she murmured before handing the baby over to him. Ben looked down at the child in his arms, blue eyes staring up at him. The corners of his eyes filled with tears, and he chuckled glancing at Anna, as she laid next to him, on the bed. “He has your eyes,” he whispered. Anna set her hand on his and moved closer, “A lot of newborns have blue eyes. They’ll probably change.” “Really?” “Really.” He looked back at the infant in his arms, and lifted his hand to his mouth, letting out a stiff sigh, fighting the tears that threatened to fall. Anna reached up, and sat up, taking his hand in hers. “Ben?” He stared at the blue scarf wrapped around her neck, “I never thought… hah ,” he cleared his throat and met her gaze, “I never thought I’d see him or you again.” Anna looked down at their son. “You’re here now,” she whispered, leaning forward, staring into his eyes, “And that is all that matters.” Ben closed his eyes, “I love you,” he whispered, “So much.” The End Notes: EDIT: there is a bonus chapter after this.

Yay! Lots of love--- Mahana. Oh, and I'll just leave this here... XD Chapter 43 Summary: Follow-up oneshot, kinda like a where are they now thingy... Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “Koren Han Solo, get back here!” Anna called as the two year old ran down the temple hallway giggling and shrieking as he went. Shaking her head, his mother ran after him, and held her hand out, the child’s feet floating off the floor. He wiggled and flayed his arms as he rose and flipped through the air, his curly black hair hanging down over his brow. With a shriek the force around him disappeared and he fell into Anna’s arms. She chuckled as he buried his face in her shoulder and gripped her robes in his tiny little hands. “Thank god your grandmamma isn’t here, she’d let me know just how much I deserve a little Dinko like you,” she muttered with a smirk as she turned around and carried him down the steps. Snapping his head up the little boy grabbed her by the cheeks and squealed excitedly. His bright blue eyes stared into hers as though this was a matter of life and death. “Gama?” Rolling her eyes Anna shook her head as he kicked her in the side, trying to get down to go find Leia, “Oh no you don’t…” ************************************************************************************* Ben wiped his face as he stared down at Rey. She paced a couple yards ahead of him, her staff flourishing through the air as she huffed with each step. “Are you going to keep me waiting all day?” he called to her, tauntingly. Shrugging her shoulders she squared off and bent her knees. With a yell she lunged forward and brought down the end of her staff, aiming straight for his head. Gritting his teeth he raised his arms, blocking her blow, “It’s too easy to get under your skin,” he said pushing her back. Spinning around he jumped up and lashed out with his own staff, letting it cut through the air, until it stopped just a few inches from her neck. Rey froze and stared at him as he let a smile shine through, “Be patient, and forget your anger.” Straightening up he leaned against the stick and cocked his head as Rey sighed. “You’re just so annoying,” she taunted back, the corners of her lips pulling up into a grin. Ben shrugged. “I get that from Anna all the time. So much it doesn’t bother me too much anymore.” His shoulders shook and he turned around, “You’re getting better.” “Oh? Then why do you keep beating me?” she asked, walking alongside him to the bench where their things lay. Ben licked his lips and laughed. “What can I say? I’m awesome,” he joked. Rey set her training staff aside and pushed back her hair. “Whatever you say, Master Solo.” Ben made a face and sat down, “Don’t you have a group of padawans you’re supposed to be teaching to meditate?” Rey glanced at the clock and groaned. Stuffing her things into her bag she took off in a run for the door. “Wey!” a small voice squealed and Ben glanced up, Koren and Anna coming in as Rey left. The girl patted Koren on the head before running out the door. Smiling Ben stood and started for them, his eyes meeting with Anna’s. Bending down she whispered something in their son’s ear and he turned around immediately focusing on Ben. Grinning the little one ran across the training room, and crashed into Ben’s legs. Groaning, he stumbled to the side and fell to the floor dramatically. “Oh no! You got me!” Reaching down he tickled Koren’s sides and sat up as Anna walked over to them. He chuckled as Koren writhed in his arms and he stood slowly, laying the boy over his shoulder like a sack of wheat. “That time already?” he asked as Anna stopped next to him, and set her hand on Koren’s back. “Luke wants me to take over the older class today, get them started on Shii-cho.” Ben scrunched up his nose. “That’s boring stuff, you should stay with us today,” he said glancing over his shoulder as Koren kicked his legs. Anna shook her head, “Yes well, boring or not, I still need to do it. You aren’t the only one with new responsibilities around here.” Twisting Koren around, Ben set him on his hip and held him, “This master thing isn’t as fun as it looks.” Anna sighed and leaned up, “Tell me about it,” she said giving the boy in his arms a quick kiss. Koren shook his head and leaned against Ben’s shoulder with a sigh. “I’ll see you two tonight,” she whispered cupping Ben’s cheek and planting a fast kiss on his lips too. Backing away she waved her hands as though she was convincing herself that she really did have to leave, “You two have fun,” she said as she walked to the door, “Go play outside or something.” Ben smile and shook his head, and murmured to his son, “Yeah, you want to learn how to shoot a blaster Koren?” he asked tossing the boy up into the air. He laughed as Anna stuck her head back in through the door with a serious look on her face, “ No, blasters.” Looking between Koren and his mother Ben sighed dramatically, “Yes, ma’am.” Notes: Sooo... this idea came to me and I kind of needed to write it up and since it is connected to this fic I wasn't sure how to post it. Anyways its just a quick follow up one shot, and I thought you guys might like it. I might post some more but no promises. I needed to write this up cause its cute and the Kylo Ren/ OC fic I'm working on right now isn't... Speaking of which you can check that new fic out here if you haven't already it's called How Much Do I Owe You?::: Link text Chapter 44 GUYS, I HAVE AN IDEA: Hi, so I just had an idea to continue this story--- What happens to Ben and Anna after their happily ever after? What about their son Koren? Rey? Poe? Finn? If you'd like me to start working on it, comment below. I need ten "Aye" comments though before I'll start working on it, so let me know what you think! ~mahana Chapter 45 : Here We Go Again... Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Fire burned around him, clouds of smoke swirling around his feet. Destruction, death, despair--- that’s all there was. All that existed cried out as the world crumbled upon its foundations. A shadow whispered in his mind. “I made you who you are. There is no turning back from me now.” So much pain, so much loss. But then, somewhere in the darkness, a voice crying out, screaming in the wreckage. The sound was sharp and tinged with fear. Slowly, he turned his dark pupils glinting in the light, his dark hair framing his face. Perhaps something could still be salvaged, maybe something could be reclaimed. Perhaps, he could find balance once again. ************************************************************************************* Brown eyes stared at the ceiling as cries of distress echoed from the adjoining room. With a sigh, Ben glanced at the clock beside the bed. That’s my cue, I guess. With a stiff groan, he sat up and looked beside him as a smooth, toned leg brushed against his. “Ben?” Anna mumbled as he sat up on his elbow. Her brown hair was scattered over her face, and in the darkness all he could see of her face were her plump lips blowing her hair from her mouth. “I’ve got it,” he whispered as he pushed back the blankets before running his fingers over her bare arm. “Go back to sleep.” Ben chuckled as her reply was quickly stifled and she snuggled deeper into their bed. For once, her stubbornness was finally laid to rest. He hissed as he set his feet on the cold slate floor, and stood up. The cries grew louder and he moved faster, grabbing a shirt from the chair beside their bed, and slipping his arms through. He left it unbuttoned and reached up, running his fingers through his head as he moved and opened the door. The cries of an infant were loud and clear, and he tiredly walked into the room. A small crib was placed one wall and a child’s bed was on the other. A small groan came from the bed, “Dad, make it stop. ” “Go back to sleep, Koren,” Ben said as he went over to the crib and looked down inside. “I can’t .” Sighing, Ben glanced over his shoulder as he reached down and slid his hands beneath a small little bundle, “Go take my place, it’s gonna be awhile.” Quick little footsteps shuffled behind him when Koren jumped from his bed and ran into Ben and Anna’s bedroom. Shaking his head, Ben picked up the crying baby, “See what you did Mari? Now we’re both going to have to sleep in here.” Notes: So, that was short, I know but I just wanted to give ya'll a taste of something. Let me know what you think--- I'm still planning where to take this so any requests or ideas should be given now! There'll be more soon! P.S. Does everyone understand they've got two kids now? Let me know in the comments if that's clear or not. :) Notes: If you've just started reading feel free to let me know of any mistakes, or inconsistencies. I am not the best when it comes to editing, and I know that can be a bit annoying. Also if there's something you really like, let me know, because I may be able to use it in a new fic if I know what readers want to see! Thanks!- mahana
