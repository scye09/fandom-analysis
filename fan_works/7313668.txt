I am fading...I can feel it. I don't know who I am anymore...I don't know who I should be anymore... I wear so many titles....so many faces under this mask. When I do fade who will remain?? What will remain?? I want to go back...I just want to be me again....before the "Change" came. I don't want to fade...I just want to be me.
