“This is my favorite time of the year. Like, tomorrow starts Halloween season. I’m so excited!” Hux had never seen Kylo this…emotive. It was like watching a six-and-a-half-foot tall toddler as he gesticulated wildly and bounced in his seat. “What, pray tell, is so special? You wear black every day of the year, Kylo.
