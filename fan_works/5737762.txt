»Finn?« »Hm?« »I am so sorry, but I think my arm is falling asleep...« »Oh.« Rustling. »Better?« »Yes, but uhm-« »What, Poe? I wanna sleep.« »I don´t know how you managed it but your knee is crammed into me ribcage.« A deep sigh. Again rustling, a huff. »Now?« »Perfect.« A kiss pressed to a temple. A few moments later. »Poe, your feet are cold.« »Yes and you are warm.« »I am not your furnace though.« »Fine.« Some moving around. A happy sigh. A grumpy grumble. »This is so not working out.« »It so not is.« »I have an idea.« Moving, pushing pillows off, pulling blankets, rearranging body parts. Finn draping across Poe like a cuddly octopus, Poe´s feet wrapped in the blanket, his arms loosely around Finn. »Perfect.« A few moments later. »NO! BUBBLES! DOWN! GET OFF« A loud sneeze. »Just sleep. It´s ok. Just... sleep.« »Ok, love you, sweet dreams.« Silence. »Did you just?« »Hm?« »You so did. Love you too.« »Didn´t want you to beat me to saying it first.« A smirk, a shove and both falling out of bed in a tangled heap. Laughter, kisses and eventually sleep. Notes: I hope you enjoyed.
