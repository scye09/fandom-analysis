He’s exhausted, barely managing to step out of his clothes and into their bed. No injuries, but he’s been awake too long, and eventually his body shuts down. His kisses to her throat become snores and so she cups his jaw and tells him to rest. He doesn’t like to fall asleep on her, but it’s testament to how tired he is that his eyes close and his arms lie on her. Kylo never likes to leave her unfulfilled, so she parts her legs around his knee, and starts to slide her sex against him. It’s a light pressure, but she can keep up this hazy contact for a long time. She’s missed him, and knowing he was coming home has left her longing, aching with the emptiness inside of her that only his presence fills. Kylo barely reacts, but that’s okay. He breathes a little faster, and she reaches to split her lips around his bare flesh, taking the friction and enjoying the light buzz. His hands paw at her waist, and she kisses his lips. “Just lie still. Just lie still, my love.” He bends his knee, and that helps so much. Her writhing intensifies, the slick of her walls making it easier, her climax threatening and not resolving. “My fingers?” he offers. “No need,” she answers, and rubs harder. She’s still open and empty, but she knows he’ll be inside her again soon enough.
