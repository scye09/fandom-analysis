Shaky Breaths When the General saw them enter, his heart stopped. He had never seen them before. Why is that? He wondered. He watched as they observe their surroundings, with curious eyes. Ah, they must be new. They turn their head, and Hux makes eye contact with them. He took in shaky breaths, he almost felt as if they were staring into his soul. That they could see into him, his darkest secrets, his desires, his fears, hopes and dreams. And he was alright with that. He loved it. Chapter 2 : Unbearable Pain Hux holds their hand as the medical droids removed the bullet deep in Y/N's side. They were crying out, breathing short and rough, and sweat rolling down their forehead. "Just hold on, Y/N. You're almost done." Hux says soothingly. He looks down at them with slight fear in his eyes. The both of them could feel unbearable pain, Y/N physical and him emotional. Would he lose them? Would they just shatter away? Would he never see their beautiful E/C eyes again? No. He would not let that happen. Not on his life. Chapter 3 : Are you Hurt? He was pacing again. Have I been stood up? Does Y/N have any interest in me anymore? Is this some joke? Millions of questions race through his head, one after another. Until he hears a knock at the door. He opens it. "Y/N! What took you so long?" Y/N stands in shock, he seemed on edge. "I'm sorry, I was just nervous, I was- Are you hurt? You're sweating, you almost look sick!" Hux straightens, "No. Of course not. I was just expecting you." He clears his throat. "Are you ready?" Y/N nods. "Let's go." Series this work belongs to: Part 1 of the General Hux and Reader Prompts series
