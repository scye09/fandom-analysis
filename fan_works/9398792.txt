Queelez tweeted me a link to this tumblr post last night that said "no context. no backstory. don't look at my tags. just read it." And I did, out loud to my roommate in fact, and it was so delightful that I needed to do it again into a microphone. (Also, I couldn't sleep. I needed this distraction today.) HUGE thanks to platinumvampyr, who made the Stabby art for me in 2 hours after I texted her "would you be willing to do me a favor" at two in the morning <3
