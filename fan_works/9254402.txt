A lot. More than a lot. A lot a lot.” 26. “Don’t be stupid, I’m not leaving you.” 2.“Shut up, okay? I’m getting you out of here. We’re going home.” Hanne Lilja thought she was just a pilot. That he didn't know she existed. Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Hanne grunted as she brushed loose strands of blonde hair out of her eyes. "This is officer Lilja. My ship has a busted engine. I-" My radio cuts out and I throw it on the ground. "Useless piece of junk!" I pop my head up from my hiding place behind a sand dune and shoot down a stormtrooper. "One down, forty-five to go. You can do this." Before I can shoot again the radio buzzes. "Co- in - ship" "This is officer Lilja. Please repeat." "I said I'm coming to get you!" The voice belonged to Cassian Andor. A Captain , who was good handsome beautiful, of the Rebellion. "What!? Don't be stupid! I'm doing fine! I have explosives rigged. And the detonator is in my hands." The radio is silent. "You are not doing that!" "Captain Andor!" 'NO! Just shut up okay? I'm getting you out of here!" I wince as a ship landing sends vibrations across the ground and causes me to jerk. I clutch my side and cry out. "Oh thank the maker! K2! I found her! Come on Hanne We're going home." " Cassian! Please, the button. I pressed it when I fell over! I'm slowing you down! Just leave me." "Don't be stupid. I'm not leaving you." He runs faster though as we are surrounded by beeping. "How many explosives did you rig?" "507" "507!?" He screams as we get on the ship. "Our chance of survival went from 10.8% to 5%." ''FLY THE SHIP K2!" I wince as I am set down. As my vision begins to go dark I see Cassian's face. "Come on Hanne! Come on! We're almost there!" ___________________________________ Beep. Beep. Beep. I open my eyes with a groan. A familiar head of brown hair catches my gaze and I smile. "Oh, Cassian. You know, I've always had the biggest crush on you. But you never knew who I was. I never wanted to admit that I like you. A lot." He shifts and sits up with a small yawn and a smile. "I like you too. More than a lot. Like a lot a lot." " Really?" "Yes, Hanne. Really." As he leaned down to kiss me I smiled. As his lips met mine my heart soared. "There is a 47.8% chance that one of you will die leaving the other in crippling pain. Yet you insist on continuing. Humans." Notes: I hope you liked it! Thanks for requesting and reading! Kisses Allessa Chapter 3 : Kylo Ren: Are You Insane!? Chapter by AllessaRen2198 Summary: Y/N thought his phase was over. Kylo, however, was just getting started. Notes: This was absolutely so much fun to write! I hope you like it! This one is for my best friend Lilly! Enjoy! -Allessa 11."Give em’ hell.” 23."That doesn’t sound safe. Let’s do it.” Y/N could not find Kylo anywhere. Usually, she either followed the sparks and crashing noises, the choking sounds, or Hux's yelling. Today it was unnaturally silent. And she was not the only one who noticed. As she passed she felt the tension rolling off of 'troopers and workers alike. One officer even stopped her. "You, uh, haven't happened to see Lord Ren have you?" When she gave him a blank stare he sighed, bowed and moved on. Finally, she felt the pull of the Force. He wanted her to come to him, and so she obeyed. When she found him, though, she wanted to kill him. "Again?" "Care to join me for another challenge?" "Kylo, I do not know if you have noticed but this is a garbage shoot. What exactly is the challenge?" "In ten minutes this compactor will begin to crush its contents. We are going to see if we can get out in time." Y/N blanched. This was the final straw. "Are you insane!?" "Relax, I can always stop it with the force." "And have Hux murder you for fu*king up his ship again!?" Behind the mask, Kylo raised an eyebrow. "Are you...chicken?" "I am no- Kylo this si ridiculous! That isn't safe and you know it! That doesn't even SOUND safe! " Kylo simply shrugs and then uses the force to pen the shoot. "Well, then I guess I'll see you." "FINE! Alright! Let's do it. " With a roll of her shoulders, Y/N followed Kylo down the chute. Her stomach did a small flip at the rush of adrenaline she felt sliding down the almost straight shoot. And when she landed, in Kylo's arms, the stench hit her. "Oh god! The food smells even worse down here!" It was an odd mixture of rotten eggs, mold, wet dog, and feces. When the water moved though she screamed. "Kylo! I did not sign up for this!" "it's noth-" "IT'S ALIVE" "Then we better get out of here shouldn't we?" The two spent the next couple of minutes trying to pry the door open. When she looked at Kylo he seemed to be acting something out. "The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered!" Kylo does some sort of twirl and goes up against the wall. "Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed!" He turns back. "Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here." Y/N sighed and sat down. He was doing it again. Ever since he'd killed Han Solo, he would get stuck in ruts of thinking about his parents. Snoke was abut done with him. Suddenly the walls jerked and began closing. "Kylo? Kylo!?" He stayed still. "KYLO PLEASE!" At her final plea, his head jerked up. In one motion she was in his arms and the force was crushing the controls. Silently he carried her out of the compactor. They were covered in garbage and everyone who passed them either ran away or gagged. But Y/N did not care. Kylo needed her here with him. "REN!" Hux stood, stance wide in their way. His eyes were so thin they could have been slits in metal. "General." Y/N said slowly. "Kylo. GO back to our room." " Give 'em hell ," Kylo said in her mind. "Why did you try and close the doors early?" "I do-" "HUX! We were in there for five minutes. We had ten minutes. The doors were closing." "I am tell-" "I don't care. You find who wanted us dead. And you do it NOW! Are we understod!?" "Yes, Lady Ren. We are." With a gulp Hux quickly strode away. If there was one thing Hux appreciated about Ren, it was that the company he kept was bad ass enough to get some work done. Now to find the idiot who thought they could kill Ren. Chapter 4 : Kylo Ren: I'm Your Battle Partner. Always. Chapter by AllessaRen2198 Summary: 11."Give em’ hell.” 23."That doesn’t sound safe. Let’s do it.” Notes: For Cosmic. Enjoy!! Y/N could not believe it! He had locked her in their room again. She was his battle partner! He couldn't leave her behind every time he felt like it! Well, she'd just have to do it herself. After gathering her blaster and Vibro-blades she searched for an exterior vent. Unfortunately for her, there were two 'troopers in the way. And they were meant to keep her there. "Hello, I was wondering if you could escort me to battle?" She asked with a smile. "My lady we-" Her blades were quick as she cut them down. "I did ask first." Quickly she ran outside this ship and immediately ducked. "What the hell!? Kylo I thought you said this would be easy!" "Y/N!? Get back on the ship!" "NO! I'M YOUR BATTLE PARTNER! ALWAYS!" He sighs as they duck against resistance fire. "Fine! Okay here's the plan. You run to the base and put up these bombs." "What are you going to do?" "I'm going to draw their fire. And then block it." " That doesn't sound safe. Let's do it! " "All right go! Go!" At his words, Y/N took off running. Behind her, she heard his lightsaber activate and begin to block the shots. Around her resistance troops and 'troopers alike fell to each others fire. Blasts hit the sand as she dodged the bullets from X-Wings and TIE fighters. Finally, she made it into the base. The fire from outside dimmed and she took in the surroundings. "Wow, their fashion sense and interior decorating skills are no better than ours. Gray, gray, and look! Even MORE Grey! Even some black." Y/N placed the first explosive and turned it on. "Who does Kylo even think he is? I mean taking fire? That's suicide." The fourth explosive went up. "Well, he is pretty thick when it comes to self-preservation. It's amazing he has made it this far in the first place. Why-" "HEY YOU!" Y/N casually shot the two resistance fighters over her shoulder. "I'm too busy to play boys." She placed the tenth and final explosive. "Well then there-" "No time! Come on." Kylo appeared out of nowhere. "Alright alright already!'' "Just run faster!" As they ran she wildly shot her blaster at as many resistance members as she could. "They are evacuating." "Not enough of them, though," Kylo said in response, cutting down several fighters in their way. "I had to kill two 'troopers." "You can explain that to Phasma." "You think she'll be mad?" Y/N ducked and shot a fighter who was about to kill Kylo. "I mean she likes me. And it was only two compared to your fifteen a week average." "Maybe I will kill you first." "You love me too much." "I'm a dark side force user. I tolerate you at most." Finally, after almost dying several times, they made it back to the command shuttle. "Go. Now!" Kylo shouted. Then he turned to Y/N. Go on. Let's Give em' hell. " Y/N smirked and pushed the red button. As the ship entered light speed the base behind them went up in flames. "You know Kylo? I truly do love it when we work together." Kylo's response was a shake of his head. "Come on. We still have a debriefing to go to." "What? Why am I going? You are the commander." "And you are my battle partner. Always." Y/N shook her head. "You've got me there." Chapter 5 : Cassian Andor: I Will See You Again Chapter by AllessaRen2198 Summary: Cassian had no one. Then he had someone. And suddenly he was once again alone. Notes: 1. “All the people I’ve murdered by letting you live.” 17. “Don’t you dare say you love me!” 40. “There was never really anyone else.” So I didn't know how to take the request. You just said to break your heart. I hope you like it! For maximum sadness listen to "See You Again." by Carrie Underwood. This was great to write. -Allessa (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) Cassian's P.O.V. Cassian was fucked. He knew it. He knew it when he saw K2 being swamped by ‘troopers. He knew it when he saw rebels dragging K2 back to the ship. He knew when the blast doors to an Imperial prison cell closed with him as the prisoner. What he didn’t know, was if he was going to get out. Days, weeks, and soon a month had passed. Cassian was sure the Rebellion had forgotten him. Until one day an imperial nurse who had been sent to fix him up after torture sessions arrived three minutes before midnight. “I thought I was done for today.” “That’s not the snarky captain I’ve gotten used to.” Cassian’s head shot up at their voice. “Wha-?” “Shhh. Just help me get you out and I’ll explain everything.” It had to be a dream. Get yourself together Andor! With nowhere near enough motivation Cassian pulled the last bits of energy he had to haul himself into the sanitary cart the nurse had brought with them. It was hard to hold in the grunts of pain, but throughout the journey, Cassian managed. When they came to a stop in the ship hangar it was suspiciously quiet. “Where is everyone?” “Shh. You are going to take the place of an Imperial pilot who..well it doesn’t matter.” They helped him out of the cart and handed him a uniform. “You aren’t resistance.” “No. I am not. If you hide in that nook, you should be able to blend in come launch time.” Cassian’s head was filled with thoughts. “Here. This paper lists your TIE number, the exit codes, and the coordinates you have to make it to before you can leave safely and not noticed. I’ve disabled the tracking data on your ship. They won’t notice. I can guarantee that.” The person in front of him suddenly goes quiet. “All the people I’ve murdered by letting you live.” With that, they were gone. Cassian knows he will remember all of this later. He knows he will tell the Rebellion who helped him. For now, he has a role to play. _____________________________________ “You say a nurse Captain Andor?” “Yes. They were very quiet. Never said anything other than the usual statements.” “Ahh. And they were not rebellion?” “No.” “And they stayed.” “Yes.” “Hmmm. We have your next mission.” Cassian groaned internally. “Find them. Bring them here.” “Yes, Commander.” “You are dismissed.” Cassian sighed. What had he gotten himself into? _____________________________________ “K2! Come on!” They skid to a stop behind an old crumbling rock half-wall. “Cassian. We have a 15.7% chance of find-” ‘'Found them.” ‘Nevermind.” “K2. You stay here. Get the ship ready. I’m going to have to grab them.” “Alright. But next time I want to grab the victim.” “They are not a victim K2!” “They are. A kidnap victim and nothing else.” As K2 lumbered away Cassian cursed under his breath. “You’re wrong. They are a person.” Then Cassian lunged. ____________________________________ “Captain Andor.” “Y/N” “How do you know my name?” “You told them, during a, uh” “Torture session? The rebellion is worse than the empire!” “It’s been three months Y/N. You have to tell them something.” “Why?” Their face had gone pale. They knew, Cassian could tell. “Or I kill you.” “Here?” “No. Somewhere where the Empire will find you. They know you are important. That you’re not a nurse.’’ Their face twists into a form of emotion Cassian is not familiar with and knows he’s found something. He also knows he is feeling something he shouldn’t. A warmth in his chest for this stranger who had pretended to be something they weren’t all to save him, even though it was against all they knew. “If I tell you, will you let me go?” “They will tell me to kill-” “I know. Will you let me go?” Cassian bites his lip, swears, and runs a hand through his hair. “Yes.” _____________________________________ “This is where I leave you Y/N. You can be someone new.” Cassian feels a surge of jealousy as he watches them turn in a slow circle outside the tiny hut. “They won’t find me?” “No one will. You’ll be safe.” “Since when do you care about my safety?” Cassian blanches. He knows but he won’t answer. His heart that had somehow stopped beating for others had suddenly started to beat again for the gorgeous creature in front of him. “Does it matter? I’ll be by to check on you.” He turns to walk away and Y/N catches his arm. “Thank you, Cassian.” The look on their face almost makes Cassian stay. Almost. “Goodbye,” he says gruffly. Y/N waves and disappears into the hut. ________________________________________ “Captain Andor. What is on Naboo that is so important you have stopped multiple times during missions?” Cassian knows he is caught, but he stands tall. In the first month he had visited Y/N he had developed a crush. In the next two, he knew that loving them was not possible. In the last he had accepted that he was done for, and he would have to stop visiting for Y/N’s safety. He was too late. “You were ordered to kill the Imperial Nurse who saved you.” Cassian bows his head. “You are dismissed.” When Cassian reaches the door the captain places a hand on his arm. “You have two days.” Cassian nods and is grateful for this reprieve. _______________________________________ Cassian smiles when he sees them bent over their small garden. “Cassian!” The smile on their face is enough to make him frown and break his heart. Y/N notices. “What’s wrong.” His look says it all. “They know.” “Yes.” “How long?” “Two days when I left. Someone told them though so about ten minutes.” “I only have ten minutes to say that I lo-” “ Don’t you dare say you love me! ” “But Cass, I do. And you love me too.” “Yes, I do and now like everyone else I have ever even thought of loving, you are going to die!” Y/N traces his cheek with a sad smile. Cassian doesn’t know but at that very moment a sniper was setting up to take the shot, and Y/N had seen them. It was now or never. “I think it’s time you knew who I was. So you can tell them. I am the granddaughter of Tarkin.” Y/N takes a deep breath and Cassian’s heart seizes painfully. “You are my world Cassian Andor. We will be together again. I promise.” Y/N turned them around so their back was facing the sniper. However, they kept Cassian’s eyes on them. “ There was never really anyone else. Not for me.” “Please don’t say goodbye. We can still get you out of here.” For the first time in years, Cassian feels tears sliding down his cheeks. “Goodbye, Cassian.” And as the shot is fired Y/N pulls Cassian’s lips to their’s in a sweet first/last kiss. Cassian feels his heart being ripped out. _________________________________________ On the horizon, the death star approached. Cassian clung to Jyn and their eyes met. They shared a smile. As they embraced, Cassian’s thoughts fell to Y/N. They were right. They would be together again. “I am coming mi Estrella.” Notes: I WROTE THEY/THEM MY FIRST TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HAHAH YES! Oh my I cried during this. I hope you liked the way I chose to use the prompts! I was going to do one where Y/N was a bounty hunter but then I was like "No, an Imperial would see this and go hey look another rebel to kill our soldiers." Ad so then this happened. I was gonna put it in Y/N's P.O.V. but I thought Cassian's would be sadder. Let me know! Chapter 6 : K2: Can one love a machine? Chapter by AllessaRen2198 Summary: Elise thought K2 was a friend. Then again, many things Elise had thought before were wrong. And Cassian was truly no help at all! What with running off like he did! “Don’t you think for one second that I didn’t care.” "Yes! I love you!" “Can I borrow a kiss? I promise I’ll give it back." Notes: Um… droid x human … okay so kind of love but kind of platonic but not? Yo asked for angst. There was angst while writing it and sort of angst in it. This is me flailing my arms and shouting “AHHHHHHH” and then panicking onto my keyboard. Oops? (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) Elise blew her blonde bangs out of her eyes. It was another regular day in the Med-Bay. After getting her abdomen ripped open by a blaster shot- cue shivers of disgust and horror from said sights- she had been banished to the corner to heal while other patients who were “more relevant” and “Not doing as well as she was and she would be out soon, I promise” got healed and then left. Elise was about done with it all. Her only visitor had been Cassian Andor. Cassian had found her when she was little and taken her in as his apprentice of sorts. That was how she met K-2SO. When Cassian first suggested reprogramming the droid, Elise threw a wrench at him that put him in the med-bay for a week. Throughout that time she had done everything she could to stall the destruction of the droid. By the time Cassian was better, she was already working. It had taken the better part of a year, due to missions and such, but finally, he was done. The proudest moment of Elise’s life was showing the rest of the rebellion the droid. He towered above everyone, intimidating and quiet. But Cassian and Elise had programmed him to be like a child of sorts. It meant he would follow orders. The biggest offense of sorts was when all of the credit was given to Cassian. When he tried to defend her she had simply patted his shoulder. “It’s alright Captain. You need this more than I do.” And it was true. Besides, she knew K2 was a keeper when the first words to he spoke to Mon Mothma herself were “I’m K-2SO and you look absolutely horrific.” Then he turned to her and said. “For a human, you are very attractive.” Only Cassian had caught that part and he had laughed. A lot. Too much. Elise snapped out of her memory at the sound of a droid screeching. Then came K2’s voice. “I have a message for-would you get out of my way!” The statement/question was shouted as Elise spotted an R2 model flying through the air into a wall. Since K2 was so large and the doorway so small, only his head fit through the door. Outside there were already shouts for Cassian “To get his damned droid out of the way”. “ Don’t you think for one second that I didn’t care. I simply didn’t have access.” Elise smiled. “I know K2. I’m almost healed.” “Good.” Then he was gone. Elise knew he meant well, but was bothered by his sudden disappearance. A human couldn’t love a droid! Could they? ______________________________ It was two days later, and three hours each day of K2 asking why she could not be released, that Elise was finally free. To finish off her healing they had dipped her in a bacta tank. When K2 asked why they had not done this in the first place he got the answer of “She is not of high enough rank. Therefore, she was not the priority.” Apparently, K2 had thrown a tantrum. A real live toddler-style tantrum. And she had missed it because she was in the tank. Cassian had said afterward, as she was fiddling with K2’s arm, that it had been momentous. K2 had been banished from everywhere but Cassian’s ship. “They grounded me!” “Yes, K2. Because you misbehaved.” “But I am a droid!” “A very big one. You nearly destroyed everything. It’s a miracle you did not hit her bacta tank!” Cassian said in a matter-of-fact tone that parents used with children. “That could have killed her.” “Yes, yes it could have.” At this new information, K2 went silent. With that, Cassian quietly retreated from the ship. (Later Elise would realize just exactly why and once again hit him with a wrench. *cough cough* Cassian-is-an-awkward-teen/coward *cough cough*) The look in his eyes told Elise all she needed to know. She had to tell K2. And she had to do it now. “K2?” “Yes, Elise?” “Do you..feel emotion?” “I don’t think so why?” “Because I, well to be honest-” ‘Is this about your love for Cassian?” Elise choked on her own gasp as she fell over. “What!?” “Your heart rate elevates every time you are near him.” “No!” “Then is it someone else? Who is always near Cas-” “YOU! K2!” “You love...me?” Elise was silent. “You love a droid?” Nothing was worse than hearing K2 say those words in his straightforward tone. “ Yes! I love you!” “Oh.” It went silent and Elise returned quietly to fixing his arm. A few minutes later Cassian walked back in, and by Elise’s glare he had to have known it had not gone well. Then out of nowhere K2 turned his head to her. “ Can I borrow a kiss? I promise to give it back.” Elise fell off the chair she had been standing on in shock and Cassian fell out of the ship’s hangar onto the floor, he was laughing so hard. “Oh dear. Cassian I think we may need to take her back to the med bay.” Notes: I MADE IT! So did you like it?! *Frantic me nervous as hell* Sidenote: You're doing a great job, keep up the good work! X Why thank you! But it isn't just me! Soon the wonderful writings of three maniacs (well at least I am a maniac) will be here for your viewing pleasure. Kisses! Allessa Chapter 7 : General Hux: The Value in Life Chapter by Sanako Summary: For LittleMissDreamHeart. 3: "You mean more to me than you will ever know.” 26: “Don’t be stupid, I’m not leaving you.” 40: “There was never really anyone else.” General Hux and Y/N reach a bump in the road regarding the lack of affection within their relationship. [Angst, Fluff (ish), Happy and resolved ending.] Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Hux liked to keep things professional. As a general in the First Order, he believed in rigidness. Emotions and feelings were factors that prohibited his success, and one thing that Hux valued more than anything in his life was success. And sometimes, Y/N felt as if he valued his job more than he valued her. Hux scowled as he stormed through the door in their shared living space, slamming his gloves against the door controls. Once again, one of his subordinates had failed to meet his expectations, leaving him in a pounding headache and a sour mood. The door hissed shut and locked back in place, leaving a still silence. He looked around for Y/N, noting the eerie silence devoid of her usual bright, happy greeting. He stepped further into the living room, calling out her name once. “Y/N?” He paced around the kitchen counter to see if she was in the kitchen, before heading towards the bedroom to search for her. Hux let out a sigh of relief when he found her in their bedroom, but frowned when she didn’t acknowledge his presence. “Darling, are you quite alright?” He cleared his throat. Y/N seemed to snap out of whatever trance she was in. “Yes! Yes. You're home early.” She cleared her throat. “Um, dinner is in the kitchen. Let's eat.” She ushered him out of the bedroom and rushed past him to the kitchen, grabbing plates and utensils while setting the table. Hux stood behind his seat, slightly baffled by his girlfriend’s jittery reactions. Dinner was filled with a tense, melancholic silence. There was little-to-no conversation between the couple, and it was blatantly obvious that something was bothering Y/N. However, Hux did not wish to push her unless she wanted to come to him herself. When Y/N started clearing the dishes, he began to crack. She hadn’t spoken a single word during dinner, and he decided that if she wasn’t going to say anything, then he should. “Y/N. May I inquire why you have not said a single word during dinner tonight?” He asked. She halted in her dish scrubbing, and then began to furiously wash away the plate. “It’s nothing. It’s been a very long day.” “You have stayed home all day. In fact, you have stayed home for the last few months. I don’t see how you could have had a very busy day.” Hux commented. When Y/N didn’t reply, he pushed a little more. “Is it something I did?” A sudden crash made Hux look up from his dinner. His girlfriend was hunched over the sink with an unidentifiable expression on her face. Y/N turned around and Hux could see tears building up in the corner of her eyes. “Look, I-I know you keep work separate from our relationship.” she started. “But I…” Y/N trailed off and took off her dish gloves. Hux hesitantly lowered his spoon. “Darling, what's the matter?” “Sometimes I feel like you value your job more than me.” she let out a bitter laugh. “You know that's not true.” Hux’s sharp voice cut through the tense air, causing her to flinch. “Is it really?” Y/N stood up straighter and stomped towards him. “This is the earliest you have come home for this entire month. We haven't shared a meal in who knows how long, and forget having a relationship because it doesn't even look like we have one!” Hux growled and gripped her arm. “I only spend long hours so that you can continue living with me. Don't be so ungrateful for the things I've done for you.” “Oh I'm far from ungrateful General Hux,” He flinched at her use of his title. “but I also don't appreciate being in a relationship where it seems like my feelings are the only one that is present.” “Perhaps if you didn’t quit your job, then you might be able to have the pleasure of seeing me more often.” Y/N ripped her arm from his tight grasp and headed towards the front door. Hux’s eyes widened and he shouted, “Stop!” She paused with her hand over the door controls. “A-are you leaving me?” “Don't be stupid. You know I could never leave you.” She murmured quietly. “I'm just going for a walk.” Hux was left standing there with thoughts clouding his mind. At first, he was in denial, growling angrily and stomping around his and Y/N’s shared living space. But the more he thought about it, the more he began to resent himself. Y/N had only left her job because he told her to out of his concern for her. Additionally, he knew that she was right. How long had it really been since he last truly expressed himself to her? As her significant other, he must confide in her as much as she confided in him. General Hux grabbed his coat from the hanger next to the door, and stepped out. He spied one of the engineering technicians walking around, and immediately called out to him. “You! Have you seen Y/N?” Hux barked. “S-she went towards the mirror display up that way.” The technicians stuttered and looked at anywhere except the General. Hux briefly nodded and started walking up the hall towards the mirror display. From far away, he could see the silhouette of his beloved, looking out into the mesmerizing display of colors. He paused and stood next to her, carefully choosing his next few words. “Y/N. You mean more to me than you will ever know.” Hux felt his breath hitch when Y/N looked up at him and gave him a sad, but equally beautiful smile. “I know.” She nodded and held a hand out towards his, clutching it beneath hers. “I just wish you’d--” she shook her head and removed her hand. “...Say it more often?” He completed her sentence for her. Y/N gave no reply. “I am...a serious individual.” Hux awkwardly began. “However, you must know that I reciprocate the same feelings you have for me...if you still have those same feelings.” He looked at her for any signs on her face, whether she was pleased or downright upset. When discovering nothing, he hesitantly continued. “Though it may seem as if my occupation is the foundation of our relationship, I can assure you that there has been nobody or anything else, that I care more about than you. Even my aspirations.” Hux felt something heavy lay on his shoulder, and he looked down to find Y/N leaning on him. “I feel the same as well.” she intertwined her fingers with his. “I love you.” Hux whispered into her hair. “And I, you.” she replied. Notes: There was no specified name so I used "Y/N". I hope this is to your liking! The setting is slightly AU because I don't really know what the actual base looks like, or if there's even a "mirror display". Leave requests in the comments below! One of our three authors will get right to it! - Sanako Chapter 8 : NOTICE Chapter by AllessaRen2198 Summary: Please Read HI! Allessa here. So as of today I am officially back at school and tomorrow classes start. I have two K2 imagines I'm currently working on and have dedicated some time to writing. However, I do ask my lovely co-author Sanako to take all requests and put them in their respective folders if you could. This first week I'll be mega busy so it would help A LOT. that was it I think. Oh yes, the Poe and Finn requests! So the are being worked on! yep. Alright. Kisses Allessa Chapter 9 : Cassian Andor: Don't You Dare Chapter by Sanako Summary: Cassian x Reader 4: "Don't you think for one second that I didn't care." 17: "Don't you dare say you love me." [Angst] For Mme/anon Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Working for the Rebellion was tough. Truthfully, more than tough. There had been many times where you had considered running away, or even faking a death just so that you’d be able to live a normal life in the countryside without the hectic calls and bustling stations. However, you were drawn back into the job for the 14th year with really no way out. But you didn’t mind too much. You had been a part of this active family for years, and most of all, you managed to meet a certain dashing captain. You regretted a lot of things though. One of them being falling in and out of love with this certain dashing captain. “I need some time K2.” You sighed as you gathered the remainder of your items. You had managed to pack the few belongings you kept with you onto an aircraft and was getting ready to finally leave when K2 noticed you. “There’s been too much stuff for me to handle, especially after that last mission.” “May I inquire as to where you will be staying?” K2 asked. “Good question. I’m not sure yet.” You responded, tossing some extra jackets you had into the back of the aircraft. “Are you leaving because of the captain?” You paused in your movements, halfway stepping into the vehicle. “No.” “It is so obvious that you are leaving because of the captain.” K2 quipped. “Ha, ha, nice joke.” You scoffed and let your legs dangle over the edge. “You know it’s not just that.” You added quietly. It was a mission gone wrong. It was supposed to be quiet and stealthy; an in-and-out job. Unfortunately, that’s not always the way things go. Accidentally caught by a stray Stormtrooper coming back from taking a piss in the bushes, blaster rifles were shot and quite a few troopers were taken down. Of course, soon enough, more and more soldiers filed out of the base in neat, orderly lines and it was definitely outmatched for you and Cassian. Running back to the aircraft and flying off was not an option. Calling for assistance was also not an option because the aircraft was on the other side of the ruined city, obscured by some tall sand dunes. You and Cassian were hiding behind a short wall, crouching below it and reloading your weapons. Right behind that wall were thousands and thousands of Stormtroopers searching for the “two intruders.” You managed to reload your weapon with little to no difficulty, and you were just about ready to hop over that wall and sneak your way back to the ship with Cassian. However, it seemed that he was having weapon malfunctions with his own blaster, unable to open the powerlock and insert another energy pod. His face hid his concern and desperation, but it was evident through his shaking hands. “Take mine.” You stuck your blaster out by the barrel, pressing the grip at his chest. He looked at you and nodded, switching weapons. “Wait here.” he said. “I’ll fly over and drop a line for you.” You took his faulty blaster and lowered yourself behind the wall. Cassian gave you one last glance before peeking over the short wall and hopping over it. You could hear his footsteps lightly retreating towards the aircraft. At the time, you believed in him. You suspected that his life was more important than yours, being a captain, and you knew that if anybody needed to escape first, it would be him. You placed your full trust in him and knew deep inside that he would come back as soon as possible. He never came back. Much time later, your legs and back were starting to cramp and you could feel the strain and exhaustion seeping through your bones. Yet faithfully, you continued to hold on to that last seed of hope. And there, you fell asleep. By the time you woke up, you were in a completely different location. Someone had found you and you were taken in; interrogated, force-injected strange liquids, electroshocked, and taunted. You weren’t sure when someone came by and rescued you, but this Rebel (which you discovered later and thanked profusely was named Andrus) carried you back to his aircraft before you faded away into unconsciousness. A pair of familiar muddy boots in front of your eyes cut you out of your stupor. “K2, mind letting me have a moment?” He said. “I do mind. But I will take my leave.” K2 responded before bouncing off to who-knows-where. You looked up but refused to meet Cassian’s gaze, opting to look at his right ear instead. “Where are you going?” He asked. “I was not notified that you were assigned on a new mission.” “It’s a mission of some sorts.” You responded, looking directly into his eyes. What a mistake. Your breath hitched in your throat as you looked into his dark brown eyes. He gave you an unidentifiable look, something he would do whenever he was assessing someone. It felt like he was trying to stare deep into your brain and figure out what you were thinking. You shook your head and said, “I’m taking a break.” “Where to?” He asked again. “I don’t know yet. It’s a work in progress.” You hopped off the opening and placed your foot on the side of the aircraft to re-tie your boots. “If you don’t know where you’re going, don’t leave. Stay.” “I'm sorry captain but I am no longer under your orders.” You stood up straight and crossed your arms. “Mon Mothma has allowed me to take a leave.” Cassian gave you an exasperated look and ran his fingers through his dark brown hair. “I still don't understand why you're leaving.” “What's it to you anyways?” “Of course it matters. One of my--the best rebels is leaving!” You noticed his slip-up and how he corrected it and you couldn't help but cafeel your heart swell at the word ‘my’. Cassian continued his rant, with his voice increasing in volume. “Without notice as well! There must be a reason why you are taking leave.” “Well if it really matters to you, why did you leave one of ‘your best rebels’ back on Keha?” You pointed a finger at him. “Don't you think for one second that I didn't care! I would've come back for you!” He shouted angrily, his eyebrows furrowed so deeply that you feared it would permanently leave an indent on his tanned skin. “But you didn't. I don't think you deserve an explanation.” You turned on your heel and hopped into your aircraft, prepping the engine and preparing to shut the airlock. Cassian had the saddest look on his face, and for a moment, you wanted to jump off that spacecraft and hop back into his arms and give him a big hug. But you kept your resolve. “Y/N.” You barely heard your name over the sounds of the engine. Tightening your hand on the controls, you released the level to close the air lock. “Te amo.” You whipped your head around to look at Cassian as the air clock started to creak shut. He gave you one last longing look and the next few words you said would haunt you and him forever. “Don't you dare say you love me.” Notes: Hope this is to your liking anon! Chapter 10 : K2 : Trust Me Chapter by AllessaRen2198 Summary: K2 is suspicous. THis leads him to take action. Y/N is his forced partner. What will they discover? Notes: “I’m trying to be a better person but some people are testing me” “I’m gonna pretend like that never happened.” “Curiosity killed the cat.” All Y/N wanted to do in this moment was rip this imperial droid’s giant head off. Because he was annoying? No. Because he was being a smart-ass? No. Because he was right, and had a point, and it sounded fun? Yes. And she hated that. K2 was her frenemy, and if a droid could feel as much, she would be his. They were an unstoppable force when it came to Cassian. In no time at all they would have him chasing after them screaming. As a joke, they had been awarded two blue ribbons with the title of being the only two beings in the world that could break Cassian Andor’s infamous calm. Of course, being a droid, K2 had stood there and when the Lieut. had approached to give him the ribbon, K2 had swatted the man away in offense that ‘a measly human being would dare touch him’. Y/N had pointed out that she and Cassian touched him all the time. And, like a child with no argument, K2 had stomped away down the halls muttering to himself. Y/N smiled at the memory before remembering the droid next to her. “Why?” ‘What do you mean why ?! Because Cassian has always told me the truth. I’m K-2SO!” Y/N shook her head. Yes, just like a child.” “Trust me.” Y/N turned as K2 spoke the two words that always got her to be part of his plans. “Look K2, I can’t. I’m busy with ship repairs.” Y/N told the droid, scolding him lightly. “Please?” Her shoulders slumped and Y/N finally gave in. “Fine. but if we get in trouble it’s on you!” K2 does some odd sort of head motion that involves flailing his arms. “Now, we need a way to get Cassian off of the ship.” When K2 turned his head to her, she sighed. “Alright. Follow me and keep quiet.” As the two walked Y/N could feel eyes on her. When she looked towards his ship, she saw Cassian with raised eyebrows. Behind her K2 made a strangled beep and Y/N almost cringed. But Cassian could not know anything was wrong. At all. What so ever. “Hello Y/N. K2.” Cassian said as he nodded his head before turning back tot he ship. “Mon Mothma needs you. There are incoming Imperial Ships about to attack. If we sound the alarm, they will know we know they are coming. Surprise am-” Y/N did not even finish her last sentence before Cassian was running away. “Well, that worked better than I thought it would.” “You are terrible K2! We are going to get in so much trouble!” “ I try to be a better person, but some people test me. ” In that moment Y/N did not know who K2 was referring to, herself or Cassian, but she shook it off and entered the ship, locking the blast doors behind her. “Alright, where do you suggest we start?” Y/N asked K2 as she kept watch from a small window. “I am going to plug into the ship’s database.” “Alright. Oh no.” “What?” “Apparently the base is now preparing to launch an attack.” “Oh. We must hurry then.” “K2! If they find out we lied-” “We will be fine.” “You are a droid! You can be reprogrammed and sold! I will be killed!” “Well, I don’t think-” “K2! Y/N! What are you doing?! We have to get ready for battle.” “Cassian wait!” “What?” “Cassian listen. It was all my fault. I roped her into it. I thought ou were lying to me. As your partner, I know that it is very inefficient for you to lie to me. So I recruited Y/N to help me. We told you about the empire so that you would leave the ship.” “Thank you, K2, for telling the truth. But remember Curiosity killed the cat. ” As Cassian walked off of the ship he threw some money to the three pilots he had paid to stand outside the window Y/N had been peering through and pretend to be getting ready to fly out. “He tricked us. Y/N he tricked us! Did you see-” “Yes, K2 I did see-" "And I’m gonna pretend like that never happened. ” Y/N said as she ran to join Cassian, leaving a pouting K2 behind. Or at least he would be pouting if he was human. Chapter 11 : Cassian Andor: Say It Again Chapter by AllessaRen2198 Summary: Summary: Y/N and Cassian knew who the other was, and how they felt. Now, with the battle of Scarrif ahead, they must make a choice. Act on their feelings, or die without ever knowing what could have been. Notes: Notes beginning: I’m tired af. Sorry. Hope you enjoy! “I’m trying to be a better person but some people are testing me” “I don’t want to fall in love. not at all. But at some point, you smiled and I was like holy shit. I blew it." (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) Y/N smiled to herself as she stared at Captain Cassian Andor. Ever since she had joined the Rebellion he’d been the one she would stare at through her hair, think about at night, be worried for on missions. He was her secret , and his heart belonged to something far greater than her. “Y/N! Let’s go! We have a Rebellion to win!” She heard K2 shout. Y/N smiled and boarded the ship behind the girl, Jyn. Over the speakers, a voice asked who they were. Jyn nudged the Imperial pilot, Bodhi, to say something. “ What's going on out there? That ship's off limits. No one is supposed to be on board until farther instructions.” Bodhi seems to be panicking. “Yes, yes we are. Affirmative.” “That's an impounded Imperial ship. What's your call sign, pilot?” “Um.” Jyn sighs. “We have to go.” “It-It's um…” I step forward. “Come on Rook! Say something!’ “Rogue...Rogue One.” “ Rogue One? There is no Rogue One.” “Well, there is now. Rogue One, pulling away.” We all cheer and smile. I catch Cassian’s eye and freeze. He wants to say something, he needs to. He nods to the top deck and I follow him. Behind us, I hear K2 stop Jyn and the others. “Let them be alone. They have quite a bit to discuss.” Once the silence is so thick it’s closing in, Cassian turns to me. “ I’m trying to be a better person but some people are testing me” “Really? You think I wanted this?” “You are not stopping yourself. For years we have done this! Fought over our feelings. You begging me to give in and I cannot do it! I refuse to do it!” “Cassian! You-” “I don’t want to fall in love. not at all. But at some point, you smiled and I was like holy shit. I blew it." I gasp and back up. “So you do love me. You love me and you waited until we were going on a suicide mission to tell me. I can not-” Cassian cuts me off by kissing me fiercely. “Shut up. Be happy you got your way. I promise you this, though, if we make it back alive, I will try for you. But I do plan on trying to make it out alive for you. If I live it will be because the maker wished it to be so. You are nothing special to me, Y/N. You are simply someone who I accidentally fell in love with.” His words hurt my heart, but I know them to be true. It could never happen. I slowly leave the room and join him and the others. It is silent as people finally look at each other and realize what we have done. “Cassian?” “Yes K2?” “Did you tell-” “yes, K2. Yes, I did.” “And?” “And we will die with our secrets K2. That’s what.” I snap at the droid. Jyn and the others look startled and Cassian grunts in agreement. “Let’s go over positions.” When we land on Scarrif the air is thick. I breathe in the scent of certain death to com and sigh. “Cassian?” I whisper into the comm link. He doesn’t answer and I join the others on the mission. ______________________________________________ On the horizon, I can see the death star looming. “Cassian please answer me.” “I’m here. And I’m sorry. I should have acted, I should have loved you so deeply it hurt. There were so many things that I-” “Shh Cassian. Just, say it again.” “I love you Y/N. I love you, I love you I lo-” I hear a roar and silence and I know. Then I close my eyes, and as the immense heat hits me, I smile. “I love you too.” Notes: Hi hi! I hope you liked it! Kisses -Allessa Chapter 12 : Cassian Andor: I Will Always Love You Chapter by AllessaRen2198 Summary: Annaca loved him. And when she finally said something, she was too late. Notes: Notes: So I changed where Bodhi dies, but not how. “There was never really anyone else.” “Don’t be stupid, I’m not leaving you.” “Don’t you think for one second that I didn’t care.” Annaca froze as she heard another scream. Once again she was in the heart of battle. As a Rebellion Foot soldier, she spent way too much of her time on foot shooting things. In fact, she planned on taking a long vacation after this. After all, after this battle, the death star plans would be theirs, and the Empire would fall. Annaca’s breath caught as Cassian and Jyn stood by K2, getting ready to depart. Inside her chest, Annaca’s heart began to sprint. Cassian Andor. Her love and her life. And he did not even know it. Perhaps if they both survived, she’d ask him to join her on her vacation. “Goodluck, Cass.” the words slipped past her lips in a whisper. The man in question turned his head and smiled. “You too. May the force be with you. All of you.” Then he left. As he walked away, Annaca’s heart tightened. Why did she feel like this was the last she’d see of him? After everyone had left she turned to Bodhi. “Well, now we wait.” The Ex-Imperial pilot simply nodded. _____________________________________ “Bodhi! If you go out there, you’ll be killed!” “Just make sure you plug the cable into the ship!” Annaca flinched at a bomb going off. “We each have a part to play Annaca! This is mine. This is my sacrifice!” With those words, Bodhi was gone. Annaca watched as he ran through bullet fire, grabbed the cable, and ran halfway. They both spotted the death trooper at the same time. With a cry worthy of a warrior, Bodhi threw the cable her way. Faster than she thought possible Annaca plugged in the cable. As she did her commlink buzzed. “Get out Anna. Now.” It was Cassian. “Don’t be stupid, I’m not leaving you. Not you Cass. Never you!” “GO!” The plans have been sent! The death star is on the horizon!. For me!” Annaca felt herself breakdown as she stumbled to the cockpit. “Anna?” “Yes, Cass?” “ Don’t you think for one second that I didn’t care. That I didn’t love you. I’m sorry I never told you.” Cassian’s voice was hurried and strained. His time was near. “Cass, There was never really anyone else ” As the ship left the atmosphere Scariff blew up. Annaca choked on her tears as she sunk to the floor. “I love you Cass. I love you.” In the dense silence of space Annaca could swear there was a response, and she smiled at its words. “I love you too. Always” Then with a soft pressure on her lips she smiled, and turned to meet up with the Rebellion. She would fight for him. Chapter 13 : K-2SO: Save You Chapter by AllessaRen2198 Summary: Porso Rodis found him and together she and Cassian saved him. Now it is his turn to save her. Notes: “Shut up, okay? I’m getting you out of here. We’re going home.” “I won’t kill you…yet.” “Don’t make me laugh I’m trying to be mad at you” “ I won’t kill you...yet” Porso shuddered at the Imperial droid’s words. “Who are you? You know my partner is going to come save me right? I will get out of here!” As Porso continued to struggle the droid stayed silent, dragging her by her legs through the halls of the quickly descending, destroyed, star destroyer. It was slightly funny in a way. That something so big could be brought down by a single blaster shot to the right place. Of course, that’s how she’d ended up here anyways. “PORSO! DUCK!” Her head turned as she saw a blaster bolt headed straight for her. “WHAT THE HELL CASSIAN!” “Sorry. Now come on!” “Wait, we should bring the droid with us.” she said as they both turned to stare at the giant and hulking metal body strewn before them. Yet another powerful being downed by a blaster bolt to the heart. “We could reprogram him!” Cassian sighed. “You and your crazy ideas. Fine Rodis. You take that side.” Together the two dragged the metal body into Cassian’s ship. “Come on Captain Andor let’s go home.” “Roger that Lieut. Rodis.” ______________3 years later_____________ “Come on kaytoo!” Porso yelled as the two of them ran. Her comlink beeped and Cassian’s voice joined in the noisy chaos surrounding her. “Did you set all of the explosives?” “Yeah. Kay and I are almost out of ran-” She was cut off when an explosion went off a few feet away. Porso screamed as she was hurtled through the air. She landed at least twenty feet away with a grunt. “Oh, my are you okay?” Came kaytoo’s voice from what sounded like far off. Porso’s eyesight was fuzzy, but she could just make out the lines and contours of kaytoo. “Go kay! Leave me. This mission is too important.” Faintly she could make out Cassian’s panicked voice. “I’ve got her Cassian. We’re headed back.” “NO! Kaytoo I told you to leave me! We’ll never make it out of here in time!” “We will if you shut up, okay? I’m getting you out of here. We’re going home.” Porso sighed in defeat as Kaytoo began to run. She could feel the pain in her leg grow every time kaytoo’s right foot hit the ground. “Almost there. Cassian, blow them up now.” Kaytoo said into the commlink forever attaching him to Cassian. “You’ve got Porso?” “Yes. We are boarding now.” “Then let’s go home. Hold in there Lieut. We’ll get you home.” As she passed out from pain, she smiled. These two always had her back. _________________________________________ Porso woke up to blinding white, well, everything. “She’s awake kay. You can stop fretting.” “I am a droid. I do not fret. Welcome back, Porso-” “I cannot believe you! You directly defied my orders to leave me behind! It is your job as a droid to do as I say! And yet you never listen!” Cassian was slowly backing out of the med bay, and nurses were staring. “I love you too.” Kaytoo stated simply. Porso couldn’t help the small giggle that escaped her. “ Don’t make me laugh. I’m trying to be mad at you .” “I was only trying to make you smile.” Porso sighed. “For a droid, you are very attached.” “Only to you.” “What about me?” Porso and Kaytoo turned to where a disgruntled Cassian stood with his arms crossed. “I suppose I could say you were my father of sorts.” Porso giggled when Cassian's face scrunched up in disgust. “Oh, Kay. We love you too.” Chapter 14 : K-2SO headcanons Chapter by AllessaRen2198 Summary: Y/N and K-2SO headcanons/scenarios Notes: So I decided to change the format up for this. I thought it would be fun to do these since there is one prompt. Let me know what you think! - “K2!” “Yes, Y/N?” “Why are you staring at me?! I am TRYING to work! If I don’t fix this ship the minute you and Cassian take off you’ll blow us all up!” “I apologize. You are very attractive. Therefore I have decided to stare at you.” Y/N balked as she dropped her wrench. “Was that a blush my darling?” “SHUT UP CASSIAN!” As the pilot ran away she turned to the droid. “Did you- did you mean that?” “Of course I did.” -Y/N laid beside Kaytoo’s body. “Ha, look at us, you’re dead and I am dying. Cassian and Jyn have a one in a million chance of succeeding.” Y/N’s breath was coming shorter now, her blood covered the floor, drowning a few of Kaytoo’s circuits. “ You are very attractive, therefore I will stare at you.” As Y/N finished her words, finally admitting her love for her favorite droid, her world went dark. And she smiled. - “You are very attractive, therefore I have decided to stare at you.” The words rang through Kaytoo’s mechanical head as he stared at Cassian. “Cassian what did Y/N mean when she called me attractive?” Cassian turned his head slightly and shrugged. “She told me I had the best looking droid in the galaxy. Honestly, take it as a compliment. Considering most people don’t like your mouth.” Chapter 15 : THANK YOU Chapter by AllessaRen2198 Summary: Oh my god Hello! Allessa here. I just wanted to say a fantabulous gigantic huge thank you to everyone who has left kudos, read, and commented with requests and encouragement. To say I started this book with low expectations is an understatement. I expected rock bottom. Instead I received two wonderful Co authors and tons of support. Regarding my Co authors. THANKS FOR EVERYTHING. I couldn't do this without you two. I am truly grateful to have you here on this journey with me. This book is my short escape from reality and my schoolwork and I love it.
