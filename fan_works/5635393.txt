It almost seems a crime to sleep when he can lie here and watch Rey sleep instead. She’s so rarely still when she’s awake. Even when she’s not moving she’s constantly alert, always taking everything in, never truly at rest. It’s a gift to see her like this, brow smooth and limbs slack in the safety of deep slumber. In the safety of his bed. He longs to trace the slope of her nose—how can a nose be so pretty?—with his fingertip, but he doesn’t want to risk waking her so he traces her with his eyes instead. The fringe of dark lashes, the constellations of freckles across her cheeks, the perfect line of her jaw. The column of her neck, the shallow curve of a breast half-covered by the sheet. He drinks her in, until finally her brow crinkles and one eye cracks open. “Stop staring at me,” she murmurs sleepily. “Forgive me, love,” he smiles, not sorry in the slightest. She steals his view away by rolling towards him and settling against his chest, her head tucked under his chin, but he can hardly bring himself to mind. He wraps his arms around her and closes his eyes, surrendering to the bliss of her body against his.
