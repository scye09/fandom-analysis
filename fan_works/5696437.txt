Summary: Hux goes over the events after the Starkiller catastrophe, and the departure of Ren, one year on. Then he picks up an unexpected signal, very close by.

Hux is very touched to receive a thoughtful gift.

Hux asks an important question, and gets an incomplete answer.

[text removed, see author's note at start of work and find new revised work at http://archiveofourown.org/works/7685539/chapters/17578201 ] Chapter 6 : Elopement Summary: Two terrible men make a run for it in an old modified transporter. There is some frankly almost Star-Wars-y action. Kylo/Ben uses the Force in a spectacular and reckless fashion. "come sail your ships around me, and burn your bridges down" – The Ship Song, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) See revised version at http://archiveofourown.org/works/7685539/chapters/17578234 Notes: This is, on the one hand, quite preposterous. One so thoroughly inculcated into a way of thinking does not abandon it overnight. Loyalty would be everything to Hux, surely. And yet. I was thinking all the time of the high ranking executives and Sea Org officers who have left Scientology. And people who in Scientology parlance "blow" do so suddenly, after a period of uncertainty followed by a short period of planning, and they take any opportunity presented to do so. It depends on whether you see Hux as a Mike Rinder, Marty Rathbun type, or as a David Miscavige. Chapter 7 : Waking Up Summary: Hux considers cowardice, torture, and love. Ben wakes up. Content note for reference to torture methods. Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) See revised version at http://archiveofourown.org/works/8126885/chapters/18630440 Notes: The image of Kylo Ren mortifying his flesh with the scourge comes from the splendid Burning Heart, part of the Fox and the Wolf series by Cyanide Breathmint. I saw it and thought "this is as canon for me now" http://archiveofourown.org/works/5531912 The reference to Hux observing Ren learning to stop blaster bolts is from something I first saw in practice by altilis, part of the excellent "careful, ren" series. http://archiveofourown.org/works/5480348 Chapter 8 : At the Spaceport Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) See revised version at http://archiveofourown.org/works/8126885/chapters/18630505 Notes: everything and the kitchen sink in this chapter. you want roguish Ben Solo, here he is. you want upbringing, it's here you want sobbing, there's sobbing starting to confront guilt at past actions, there it is there's booze and after having been too busy to have any sex, there is some rimming and some fucking. A buffet. Take whatever you want. Chapter 9 : Refit and Repair Summary: The ship needs to be repaired and repainted. A deal is done for some components. Hux plays electrician. Hux also discovers a kink he had hitherto kept hidden from himself. (thus there are scenes of a sexual nature) Compartmentalising everything is hard work. Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) text removed and updated version is to be found at http://archiveofourown.org/works/8126885/chapters/18694888 http://archiveofourown.org/works/8126885/chapters/18695240 Notes: Ugh, the extent to which I have been buggering about with this instead of posting it is ridiculous. Chapter 10 : Onwards Summary: A gunfight at a spaceport. Hux sustains an injury and gets extremely salty about it. He uncovers a plot and gets extremely salty about that as well. Notes: canon-appropriate violence, self-reproach and light self-harm updated version now to be found at http://archiveofourown.org/works/8126885/chapters/18916004 which is where the story will continue Chapter 11 : hello there subscribers Summary: this is an author's note designed to ping subscribers HELLO SUBSCRIBERS. LONG TIME NO UPDATE, EH? UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS NOT AN ACTUAL UPDATE, BUT RATHER A HOUSEKEEPING ANNOUNCEMENT. However, it does announce some actual NEW content previously unpublished . [copy and paste from author's note inserted at start of fic] Updates slowed and stopped back in March because I was having doubts about storytelling choices I'd made, doubts which turned into regrets. Also some parts were just plain badly written. Specifically, the name change occurs far too early, and the entirety of chapter 4 was a near-irredeemable shitshow. Also the characterisation of Hux in chapters 1-3 was not entirely on point, and required some more shaping and subtextual direction. Furthermore, having developed my ideas for what happened pre TFA in this 'verse into my KBB fic, Fierce And Barely Concealed, I decided I might like to rewrite this post TFA story to make it a kind of sequel to FABC – although this story remains a piece of self-indulgent wish-fulfilment in a way that FABC isn't. So, having sat paralysed by uncertainty about protocol (even having taken advice from respected friends, thank you acroamatica, Kat107 and Eridani for your patience and wisdom), I am finally taking action. I am going to leave this work in situ, but delete the text. This is because my ego wants to keep the comments and kudos visible. I have revised and rewritten parts of this story, and have written a whole new middle section. I will post the new version in 3 parts. The same as chapters 1-3 of this, but better. It is called The General's Dreams . If you have already commented or left kudos here, you are under no obligation at all to leave kudos or comments on the new version. I mean, I ain't stopping you, but I'm not trying to double-dip for comments. The second part is Realignment and is hopefully Any Good. The first chapter is BRAND NEW CONTENT REPLACING THE OLD SHIT CHAPTER 4. The next two chapters in that work are revised versions of the old chapters 5 & 6 here. Revised versions of chapters 7-10 are in the third, ongoing part – Cowardice and the story is continuing there. What. A. Palaver. Thank you very kindly for any patience you have shown at any point, and thank you very much indeed for all comments and kudos. Hit me up on the tumblr hell site to yell at me about any of this.
