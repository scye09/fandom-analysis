"Ms. Serena. I'm sorry to inform this but your brother....Hux has died." The officer said as he removed his hat in respect. A frown of sorrow on his face. The ginger haired woman stood there. The words that came from the officer stung. There was no way. "He's not...Are you sure?" Her voice trembled. Serena couldn't believe this. Her own brother? Dead? He couldn't be. "If...If this is some kind of SICK joke, it's not funny." "It's not." The officer couldn't meet the woman's gaze. "Star killer is no more. And i'm afraid your brother didn't make it." Her eyes widened. Of course she's heard about the destruction of the planet. Though she suspected most evacuated. That included her brother and Kylo Ren. There was no way he could have died so easily. Serena's legs gave in. She felt utterly weak. There was absolutely no was she could lose him. He was all the family she had left. And she needed him. "No.." she mumbled as she sat there on the cold floor. "No. No. No!" She would not cry. Though her body betrayed her as tears fell onto the floor. How could he? How could he just leave her like this? And when she needed him the most too. "I'm sorry." The officer bowed slightly before walking away. His head held low as he left the woman there to mourn. Notes: LET HUX LIVE 2017 !!
