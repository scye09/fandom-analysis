To make a long, unfortunate story both short and brief: I didn't want the people I know offline reading Two Irons. Which they stumbled upon. And I panicked. And deleted. Yikes. Anyways, enough time has passed. I feel like I can safely redirect you without compromising my anonymity, so, bear with me as we play musical chairs. I will be uploading the story here in the meantime: http://calcinators.tumblr.com/ Thank you for all your views, kudos, and comments. They meant everything to me. I'm sorry for the confusion! See you all on tumblr.
