"You look a little lost." I hear a voice say to me and I turn around. Standing in front of me was a (w/m). "I-uh, yeah. You're right I am. Never been here before." They nod, and reach into their bag. "Want some water?" They pull out a dusty water canteen. "It's a little warm but it'll help." I nod and I take it from them and have a few sips. I give a thank you as I hand it back to them. "You can finish it up. I can get some more." I look at them, unsure of that statement. They lean in slightly. "I have my ways." They give a wink and I finish the water off. "So what's your name?" They ask as they put the canteen back into their bag. "FN-Finn. My name's Finn." I say nodding my head. "You seem a little unsure about that." "No. That's my name." They smile. "I'm Y/N."
