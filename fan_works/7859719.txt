“I won’t have you question my methods,” Ren slurred as he shoved Hux against the wall. His breath was a reminder of the whiskey they’d shared earlier…as was his frenzied rutting against Hux’s leg. Kylo Ren was a terrible drunk. “I told you, I’m not keeping my hat on-” Ren silenced him by violently pushing his tongue into his mouth, overflowing with a bittersweet taste. “It’s…an order,” Ren mumbled, pulling away only briefly. After returning to his business of sucking and nibbling on Hux’s lower lip, it wasn’t long before he felt a sharp tug of his hair, causing his head to jerk back. “I don’t take orders from you .” “We’ll see about that,” he smirked. The effect was somewhat spoiled by a thud and a high-pitched meow from the study. He let out an exasperated sigh when he saw Hux’s eyes dart towards the door. “Just ignore her.” “Something fell in there, Ren. It sounded heavy, I need to make sure-” “She’s fine. She’s probably having the time of her life in there.” “ Ren …” “I was tired of her… interrupting us. I just gave her some catnip, that’s all.” “You did what ?” Ren almost tripped as he was pushed aside in Hux’s hurry to get to the door. “It’s not a big deal. Catnip is perfectly-” “I don’t care, Ren, my cat is not a junkie!” he spat, but when the door opened to reveal the ginger ball of fluff he called Millicent, clutching a scale model of Starkiller’s superweapon in her paws as she rolled around, even Hux couldn’t contain his laughter.
