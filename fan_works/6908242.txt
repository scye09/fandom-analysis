Play: It's a Wonderful Life; December Notes: The name of this fic is based off the song Stuck on You by New Politics who I'm just gonna shamelessly promote because they're one of the best fucking bands I've ever listened to. You can listen to the song here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYGJur3JSvA check me out on tumblr! bluemilkskank.tumblr.com (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) A shadow falls between Hux and the blue light. "What's your name?" "Uh, Hux?" "Thanks." Hux stares after the hunched over tech, wondering what exactly he's done to warrant such a greeting. This is only his second play, and while he knows many people in the theater program, he hadn't met that boy until just now. Shrugging, he returns to his math homework. Trigonometric proofs won't prove themselves. -- "Who's the boy?" Hux asks. He's slumped against Phasma in the sound booth before rehearsal. They'd just gotten out of a tedious band practice and have yet another 3 hours before they could go home. The tragedies of being in the fine arts. "What boy?" "Him. The one in the beanie standing with redhead chick." "Oh, that's Ben. He's dating her." "Right. Of course. She is quite cute." Phasma casts him the side eye but doesn't comment. Just shakes her head and fiddles with the light board. "You should probably head down to rehearsal." "Yeah probably. See ya Phas." "Later." By the time Hux gets down to the auditorium, Ben and his girlfriend have disappeared. He shrugs off the disappointment as best he can. Hell, he doesn't even know the guy. "Get your head out of the clouds," he hisses to himself. -- "I'm Ben." The deep voice startles Hux out of his reverie. He peers up from his spot on the band hall floor, assigned reading quickly forgotten. Ben has fluffy black hair, held down by the same beanie he wears every day. His pale skin is dotted with dark freckles and his eyes are like chocolate. None of his features are graceful. Not his long nose, not his full lips, not his large ears, not his wide eyes that plead for nothing in particular. Hux finds his breath taken away. "I know." Ben's brow furrows. "Y-you know? I guess you would. I've seen you with Phasma. Crazy girl, huh? What's your name?" "You've already asked me." "I did? Oh, that's right. For the uh...well...right. Remind me? "I'm Hux." "That's an interesting name." "It's not my legal name." "What's your legal name?" "None of your business." "Ok." "That's it? No prying questions?" "No, that's it. I don't usually introduce myself as Ben." "Care to tell?" "It's Matt." "Ok." "Thank you." They stare at each other awkwardly for a moment. Ben clears his throat. "So you're in band?" "Yeah." "What do you play?" "Which year and what season?" "What?" "Which year and what season?" "Oh uh. This year, this season. What is this season?" "It's marching season. I wasn't supposed to be cast for this show, but Snoke asked me for a favor after someone dropped out." "Ok. Sweet. So what instrument?" "This year, trumpet." "You're in Phasma's section?" "Yeah. She's a good section captain. We call her Captain Phas." "That's cute. Are you an officer?" "Brass Colonel." "Brass Colonel?" "I'm in charge of the entire brass section." "But you're not a brass player." "What makes you say that?" "Marching season last year." "Do you know what I played?" "I know it wasn't brass." "Saxophone." "Saxophone!?" "I go where I'm needed." "You must be talented." "Not really." "You're talented enough to play two instruments." "Four." "Wait, what?" "Four. Trumpet, saxophone, oboe, and percussion." "Oboe is a pretty instrument." "When you play it right." "Do you play it right?" "Come to a concert and find out." "When's the concert?" "Not until spring." "That's too bad." "Bad enough to come see it in spring?" "Only for you." "Not for Phasma?" "Only for Phasma." "You're weird." "You're a prude." "Excuse me?" "Never mind." "Your insults have no context." "You act like a virgin." "What do you know of my sexuality?" "I mean. I just thought. You're in band. And you're completely covered from the neck down. Even your hands." "Are you asking to look?" "I'm not gay." "Of course not. Neither am I. Anyways, I'll have you know that band kids can, in fact, get laid." "Says who?" "My experience." "Your-" "My experience. My very extensive experience. What I choose to wear is of no consequence to my sex life. I do love a good tumble. But that's not the conversation. Unless you're offering. In which case you best have $15 or a sincerely golden cock." "Fifteen dol- are you a prostitute?" "In a sense, yes." "In a sense?" "I don't sleep with strangers. I just ask my friends nicely." "Are we friends?" "Depends. Are you asking nicely?" "I don't have $15." "Talk with your brain." "I'd love to be your friend." "Excellent. See you around then." Hux levels his gaze with Ben's as he stands. For once in his life, he's not self-conscious about his height. Rather, he feels a sick pride at the surprise crossing Ben's face. He's obviously not used to anyone but Phasma being able to look him directly in the eye. Well, just something more to get used to. Notes: So this fic is based on real events that are currently in the works and have been for most of this year. Some events have been exaggerated, like the sexual stuff definitely hasn't happened (yet), but it all has a grain of truth. As far as OCs go, I changed the names of everyone based on real people for obvious reasons, but I didn't change personalities so like... I guess if you comment don't say anything shitty about someone unless I obviously made them out to be a complete and utter douche. So square that away. Hux represents me, Ben represents my boy-toy (whose name I will tell you in the next sentence and is also mentioned in the fic because it's super common name and it's no hurt telling), and Phasma is a combo of two of our friends who are 300% done with our shit. My boy-toy's name is, wait for it, Matt; I have him in my phone as Matt the Radar Tech oops. Chapter 2 : Play: To Kill a Mockingbird; February Notes: check me out on tumblr! bluemilkskank.tumblr.com "You look..." Every word in the world flies away from Hux's mind. Ben is wearing jeans and a flannel button down. His hair is straightened and slicked back, but the ends are already curling again. A faint blush dusts his cheeks and his eyes are wide and a little too bright--stage anxiety. Hux has seen the same look on almost all the other techs that are acting as extras. Ben's ridiculously large hands fiddle with an old belt and he's chewing on his bottom lip. "Yeah, I look stupid. I know." "That's not what I was going to say." "Oh?" "You look, uh, good. You look good." "Just good?" "Just good." Hux's heart melts a little when Ben laughs. It's such an entrancing moments. His lips stay firmly pressed together, even as the corners of his mouth pull up and his eyes almost disappear behind his mirth. No sound but a quiet rumble from his chest emerges. Only on rare occasions does he smile with teeth. He once told Hux that he thought his teeth were big and awkward. Hux almost told him that he's just big and awkward in general. Almost kissed him so he could taste his big awkward lips. Of course, he did neither. His self control was resolute, further cemented by the knowledge that Ben's straight. "You look good, too, prosecutor." "I'm really not supposed to fraternize with the jury. I might sway your decision in some way." "Don't worry. You make me want to side with Atticus Finch." "Rude." "You know I love you." Hux's breath catches for the millionth time that day. Ben always says it, throws it around to all his friends. Every time Hux has to fight to keep his composure. "I do know. Dickface." "Colonel Sux." "How creative." "All for you, babe." "Slut." "Whore." "You bet your sweet little ass I'm a whore. And a good one at that." "I wished you'd stop." "I'm making good money." "I know you slept with a stranger." "Several." "Right." "Right." It's amazing how often they manage to fight, even if conversations start lightly. Hux glowers, fights the urge to curl up on himself. He has too much discipline to let Ben get to him. Anyways, his extracurriculars aren't really Ben's business. He's safe, he can defend himself, and Ben still hasn't taken him up on the offer. "Hux. I'm sorry." "It's fine." "You sure?" "Yeah." "There's a girl who likes you." "That's new." "It's really not. You're gorgeous, Hux. Any girl would be lucky to have you." "Gorgeous, huh?" "Objectively, I mean." "Right, of course." Hux knows he shouldn't bother to get his hopes up with Ben. He still does it every time. "You truly are attractive." "Do any guys happen to like me?" "Yeah." "Who?" "I can't tell." "Bros before hoes." "You really can't use that phrase." "Bro hoes before hoes." "I still can't say." "Fine, be like that." Phasma pokes her head into the dressing room. "Places in five." "Thank you five," Hux and Ben chorus in unison. "I have to go check the mic system," Ben mutters, excusing himself. "Later." Chapter 3 : Spring Concert; March Notes: check me out on tumblr! bluemilkskank.tumblr.com (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) "You working the concert tonight?" "Yeah. Phasma's helping in the booth before wind symphony's performance." "Am I allowed to join?" "Only always." "Till tonight, then?" "Till tonight." -- "Hey, Hux. Let's go." Phasma tugs insistently on Hux's perfectly pressed sleeve. He gently bats her away and smooths his uniform out. "Watch my stuff," he whispers to the person next to him. Phasma grins and struts off, swinging her hips the entire way. Hux just rolls his eyes. If they weren't childhood best friends he might be attracted to her. She's gorgeous-- tall, blonde, curvy-- with a personality to match. She loves to strut her stuff, and it's a little intimidating. Hux and Ben are apparently some of the few boys who aren't scared shitless by her. It plays nicely to her interests. She'd rather have a cute girl in her arms. "Hey guys," Ben grins, spinning in his chair. Phasma immediately pounces, wrestling his beanie off his head and ruffling his already unruly hair. Hux watches the scuffle from the doorway with amusement. There's yet to be a time where he joins in on their rough housing. Ben himself probably weighs twice as much as Hux. He knows he wouldn't last a minute against both of them. "Get over here and stop blushing," Phasma teases. Ben shoots him a goofy open-mouth grin from where he's now draped over Phasma. "I don't blush." "Whatever you say, pumpkin," she coos at him. Ben's grin gets impossibly bigger, and Hux caves. "Stupid fucking teeth," Hux mutters to himself as he gracefully strides over and seats himself on top of their little pile. Ben lets out another peal of real, unrestrained laughter and wraps his arms tightly around Hux's waist. Immediately, Hux feels small and safe in Ben's strong embrace. But he resists the urge to lay back against him, feel their heartbeats together. As much as he wants to enjoy the moment, he quickly disentangles himself and pretends to fix his uniform. "Aw, Hux, don't be such a killjoy," Ben pouts, reaching out for him. "I don't cuddle." "Yeah you do. I've seen you!" "Let me rephrase. I don't cuddle people I'm not dating." "Then let's date!" "Actually, let's not date. Don't you have a girlfriend?" "We broke up months ago." "Oh. Well, still. Let's not date." "But I wanna cuddle you." "Unless you want to have homosexual intercourse with me, and I know you don't Mr. I'm-Straight-As-A-Rod, then we can't date." "I thought you weren't gay." "I'm not." "But-" "It's a spectrum, Benjamin. I'm pansexual. All genitals are good." "Oh. Ok. Phasma's a lesbian." "I'm well aware that Phasma's a lesbian. I've set her up with several girls. In fact, she's dating one now." "Who?" "Rey." "Rey who?" "I don't know her last name. She's kind of short, brown hair, brown eyes, cute little button nose. She always has whacky hairstyles." "Does she happen to be a British foreign exchange student?" "Yes, actually. We bonded over originating from the British Isles. We're still arguing about whether Ireland or England is better." "That's my fucking cousin!!" "Well, isn't that just special." "Gross. Phasma's been sucking tongue with my cousin." "I'm pretty sure they're doing more than just some light snogging." "Why would you say that? I didn't need to know that." Hux shrugs. "Sucks to suck." "I'm glad to know my sex life makes you uncomfortable," Phasma mumbles into Ben's hair. "Are- are you smelling my hair!?" "Yeah. It smells good. Like a girl." "What does that even mean?" "Fruity. Floral. Like Rey's." "That's gross. We use the same shampoo. I'm definitely getting new stuff now." "Hux, come smell his hair." "No thanks." "No really, he smells so good." "I'll pass, thanks." "Oh, no you won't." Phasma unceremoniously shoves Ben out of her lap and stalks over to Hux. As soon as she's up, Ben scrambles to reclaim his chair. Hux doesn't even have time to laugh at the awkward limb shuffling before Phasma grabs his arm in a painful grip and hauls him over to Ben. "Fucking hell, Phas, you're going to destroy my uniform!" "I really don't care." Hux lets out an embarrassing squeak as he's planted firmly in Ben's lap. He glares up at Phasma, but the normally chilling effect is lost as he leans back against Ben's stupidly muscular chest. She looks entirely too smug. Ignoring his continued glaring, she casually turns to the light board and starts fiddling with it. "You're so tiny," Ben whispers as the concert starts. "I want to hold you all night long." "Jesus, lay off on the flirting. I get it, I like men. Now stop mocking me." "I'm not mocking you." "Well, then your flirting tactics are in need of serious improvement." "And how exactly would you flirt?" "I don't flirt." "Sure you do. I've seen it. When you're seducing clients. Because you broke your rule and now you sleep with strangers that need seducing." "That's different. There's no real feeling behind it." "But what would you do with feeling?" "Ask me when I have feelings." "Everyone has feelings." "I don't. Feelings are for weak people who want to be held down in life by obligations to others." "Do you really mean that?" "Of course I mean it. Don't tell me you have feelings for someone." "I don't know. I might. It's weird." "Well, to each their own I suppose." "At least pretend you have feelings. How would you flirt?" "Ben..." "Pretty please with ice cream on top?" "I don't eat ice cream." "Vegetarian eggrolls?" "Benjamin!" "Hux, you're an actor. Pretend you have feelings and teach me the way of flirtation." "I really don't think my methods are appropriate to employ with Phamsa in the room." "Oh, really?" Ben wiggles his eyebrows suggestively. "That's it, I'm leaving," Phasma announces loudly to be heard over the band. "You two are ridiculous." Hux quirks an eyebrow up but doesn't speak. Just watches as she speeds out the door as fast as she can. Ben clears his throat. "Anyways. You were saying?" "Bloody hell. You really want me to do this, don't you?" "Yeah, kind of. I'm curious." "Right. Well, no time to be humiliated like the present." Before Ben can comment, Hux swivels his hips in a practiced maneuver. He smirks to himself when he hears Ben choke back a moan. Not so straight after all. He plants his hands on the table in front of him and starts slowly bouncing, ignoring Ben in favor of watching the band play. It's obvious that his lack of attention is irking Ben. Deciding to be a tease, he lifts himself up but doesn't press back down, arching his back and leaning forward to get a better view. Ben makes a frustrated noise behind him and grabs at Hux. "No touching," Hux snaps, slapping the offending hands away. He can just feel Ben pouting behind him. After another minute of taunting Ben with the promise of touch, Hux presses down and grinds his hips against Ben's cock. A thrill shoots through him when he feels the hard outline against his ass, imagining how big it must be. Hux bites back a groan and continues to move his hips in a way that's just shy of enough, still not looking back. Ben swears and bucks his hips up involuntarily. "Damnit, Hux, don't be a tease." "Would it help if I turned around and straddled you?" It's a good enough answer for Hux when Ben fucking whines . In one smooth motion, he presses a hand against Ben's chest for leverage, reaches across himself to grab Ben's shoulder with the other hand, and swings his body around to straddle his lap. Ben stares, transfixed at the ease of Hux's movements, only looking at him when Hux places a finger under his chin and tilts his head up. "Look alive, sunshine. The show's right here." "Did- did you just fucking quote My Chemical Romance?" "What's My Chemical Romance?" "Uh, never mind. It's just a band." "Of course it is. Between the two of us, your taste in music is appalling." "And what do you consider good?" "Tchaikovsky is pretty nice. Stravinsky, Mahler, Sousa, Holst. Y'know, composers like that." "What modern music do you like?" A wicked grin crosses his face. "Anything I can kill to." Hux doesn't give Ben time to respond to that. He starts bouncing with renewed vigor, drinking in the way Ben's pupils explode and he unconsciously bites his lip. "Hux..." Ben breathes, reaching out as if to touch. Hux quickly grabs his wrists and pins them to his chest. " What did I say about touching? " "Sorry. I can't help it." "Obviously. I wouldn't be doing a very good job if you didn't want to touch, now would I?" Ben whimpers and thrusts up, eager for release. Hux clenches his jaw to stay his own pleasure, knowing full well he can't finish in his impeccable uniform. "Hux," Ben tries again, straining upward to kiss him. Hux's heart thrills but he doesn't lean down, instead backing away and moving faster. He knows the exact moment Ben comes. A low groan vibrates from where Hux still has his hands on Ben's chest and goes straight o his groin. Ben's entire body spasms, and as soon as Hux sees a telltale wetness, he pushes off and stands, not wanting to soil his slacks. While Ben is still dazed and disoriented, Hux wills his own arousal away. Ben reaches out for him. "Hux, let me return the favor." "I'd rather not, thank you. I still have a concert to play." "Can I at least kiss you?" "Of course not." "Why?" "Kisses are for lovers." With that, Hux turns on his heel and leaves. He gives Phasma a perfunctory nod as he passes, descending the stairs and exiting the booth. As he takes his seat, he forces Ben's satiated expression out of his head and enjoys the music. Notes: Ok so fun story, this actually happened, but in the real event Matt shoved me out of his lap as soon as I started bouncing and had to physically leave the room in order to calm down. Also, no offense meant to My Chem, I love them, but I also think it would make more sense for Hux to like the classical music I like. Chapter 4 : Phasma's House; Late March Notes: check me out on tumblr! bluemilkskank.tumblr.com (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) "I have a girlfriend," Hux starts. Ben and Phasma both choke on whatever alcohol they're balls deep in this evening. "I'm, sorry, but did I just hear Hux say he's dating a girl!? " Phasma all but yells. "Yes, you did," Hux says dryly "But... but girls don't like you." "Apparently this one does." "Have you had sex?" "Of course. We had sex months ago." "Have you kissed her?" "Phasma, dear, I never kiss and tell." "Oh my god, this is like the second coming of Christ. Hux. Dating a girl. Amazing." "I've told you multiple times that I like both girls and boys." "Yeah but like. How many girls have you dated before this?" "None." "And how many boys?" "Six." "My point is proven." "It's not from lack of trying. I've asked plenty of girls out, but they've all politely declined." "Maybe it's because you're so scrawny," Ben mutters from behind his cup, sulking. "Maybe you're just jealous because you're single and I'm not." "Maybe. I know why guys like you." "Really now?" "Yeah. Twink appeal." "I beg your pardon?" "Twink appeal. You make boys feel better about being gay because you're not super manly." "I'm manly enough." "Phasma's more manly than you." "Untrue." "Back me up here Phas." "I'm not more manly than him," Phasma says, siding with Hux. He shoots her a grateful look and sips his water. "Killjoy," Ben pouts. -- "So how are you and... what was her name?" "Rosa." "Right. How are you and Rosa?" "We're good. I'm thinking of asking her to prom." "Oh. That's nice. What are you going to do?" "I'm going to do it in a few weeks before I leave for a band competition. That way I can wear my uniform tux and look very fancy. I will bring her expensive fruit and flowers." "Why are you so aristocratic?" "I'm not. I'm pretty middle class. I just save up for special occasions." "Lucky you." "You know if you ever need money you can just ask me." "I don't want charity." "It's not charity. It's making sure a friend doesn't go cold or hungry." "If you're offering, would you let me sleep over some time? My parents are never there." "Of course you can stay over. Just behave yourself in front of my father, please. If you think I'm particular, he's ten times worse." "What about your mother?" "Not in the picture." "Oh. Sorry." "Don't be." "Ok." A lengthy silence passes - something that's been happening more and more ever since the incident at the concert. Hux wants to blame Ben, to hate him for every night he lays in bed with his heart hurting, but he knows he can't. No matter how many heartbreaking things Ben does, Hux will always run straight into his arms. Notes: Yes, it's true, I've dated 6 boys and 1 girl... all in the span of two years. I myself have twink appeal since I'm about 5 feet tall and weigh less than 100 lbs. I'm also Vietnamese so I guess I have ethnic appeal maybe? Also I'm not rich like Hux, but I live in a nice area whereas Matt lives in the ghettos of town. He lowkey wants to kill his dad so there he goes all Kylo Ren Chapter 5 : Play: Little Women (Musical); April Notes: check me out on tumblr! bluemilkskank.tumblr.com (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) "Ben, can I talk to you?" "Yeah, sure. Just hold on a moment. I still have to mic some people." "That's ok. I think music warm up is about to start anyways." "Top of act one?" "Yeah. Come to the instrument room." "Ok." Hux sighs and checks his hair in the mirror one last time. It's getting a little long, the back of it barely touching his collar, but he doesn't want to cut it. Perhaps he'll grow it out just to piss his father off. After all, he's going to graduate soon and might as well get a kick out of the rest of his home life. After deciding it's as neat as it's going to get, he breezes out of the dressing room, shirt open and makeup on. His focus is scattered during music warm up. He keeps watching Ben as he works on various sound issues when he should be watching the music director. Fortunately, singing is fairly natural to him, his ear is phenomenal from years of band, and warm up is short. It's barely even 10 minutes before he makes his escape. He retreats to the instrument room, waiting anxiously for Ben. It's dark and smells like valve oil and cork grease, the familiarity of which comforts Hux. The only light in the room comes from the window of the hallways door. Five minutes later sees Ben slamming into the room, loud and abrasive as ever. Hux cringes a little but doesn't comment. He's not there to start a fight. "You called?" "Yes. Rosa broke up with me." "Oh. I'm sorry dude." "No, it's fine. I just need a new date to prom." "You're not going as friends?" "No. She and her girlfriends are going as a group. I declined to join." "So you're asking me to prom in the instrument room?" "Yes." "That's romantic." "It's not supposed to be." "Isn't prom a romantic thing?" "Only sometimes. I was under the impression that you're straight." "I might not be." "What makes you say that?" "You." "Me!?" Hux scoffs. "You're not interested in me." "Said who?" "Phasma. She told me you slept with the redhead chick again." "I did." "Well, I hope you had fun." "Hux don't be like this." "Like what?" "Jealous." "As if I could ever be jealous of anything involving you." "I thought you liked me or something." "Really now?" "Yeah." "You're not my type." "What's your type?" "In men or women?" "Men." "Vaguely abusive assholes." "Don't say that." "You asked." "Why else am I not your type?" "Why do you care?" "I dunno. I just thought you might find me a little attractive. "Well, I don't. What gave you that impression?" "You practically gave me a lap dance." "You asked to see me flirt." "You could have said no." "I'm very bad at saying no." "You can always say no to me." "Give me something to say no to." "Can I see you flirt again?" "Yes." "You were supposed to say no." "Oh, my bad." "Be honest. Yes or no?" "Do you have a redhead fetish or something?" "Or something." "You really want to do this again?" "Only if you do." "I do." "Then yeah." "No feelings." "No feelings." "Right. Well, I guess while we're here..." Hux double-checks the lock to make sure no one disturbs them, then tugs Ben into the shadows where they won't get caught. Without making any eye contact, he licks his lips and drops to his knees. He hears the subtle click of Ben's throat as he swallows heavily. "Hux." "Don't talk to me. Just let me do this. Please." "Yeah. Yes. Ok. Definitely yeah." "Good. Now shut up before I regret this lapse in my judgment." Without any warning, Hux leans forward and unzips Ben's jeans using only his teeth. Ben makes a choked noise above him and touches the side of Hux's face. "Don't you dare even think about touching my hair," Hux snaps. "It must be perfect for the entire play." "Yes, sir." Satisfied, Hux nods and leans forward to nuzzle at Ben's predictably large cock. The boy is over six foot, of course he's generously endowed. Hux gives him a teasing lick through his briefs and delights in the full body shudder he receives. Although he wants to continue teasing, they both have to be back soon and Hux really needs to choke on a dick. He drags Ben's briefs down to free Ben's leaking cock and licks his lips at the beading precum. "You're so big," he says as he traces his lips against Ben. "I hope I don't lose my voice. That would just be so... unfortunate ." He punctuates the last word with a firm lick from base to tip. Ben does a poor job of stifling his moan. Hux darts his eyes up to find Ben staring down at him. A blush blooms across his cheeks and down his neck and he looks away from the intensity of Ben's stare. To avoid further intimacy like more fucking eye contact , Hux wraps his lips around the head and sucks. Ben lets out another low groan and drops his head back against the wall. Hux moans around Ben and traces his tongue over the vein on the underside. The vibrations make Ben jerk against him and drag his nails over the wall, looking for purchase. If Hux didn't have his mouth full, he'd smirk at how sensitive Ben is. As it is, he just flicks his gaze up smugly and concentrates on the task at hand. It doesn't take long for him to find a rhythm. He bobs his head up and down, holding Ben's hips to prevent him from bucking into the back of his throat. He doesn't really have a gag reflex, but he does have to sing in half an hour. Instead, he utilizes his tongue, licking and teasing as he shallowly fucks his mouth on Ben's cock. After a while, Ben's large hands settle on Hux's shoulders. He imagines what they would feel like gripping his hips, pulling his cheeks apart to breach his body. His subsequent moan reverberates around Ben's cock and fills the hushed room. With a strangled gasp, Ben snaps his hips forward, breaking out of Hux's grip. When Hux's hands don't press him back again, he starts thrusting in earnest, desperately seeking release. Hux lets him for a while, hoping he won't regret it come stage time. Speaking of which... Hux pulls off with an obscene pop and sits back to admire how utterly wrecked Ben looks. Above him Ben is shaking, most of his weight slumped against the wall, unable to stand properly. He's flushed and panting, sweat beading his brow and snaking down the long line of his nose. It takes him a moment to register that Hux has stopped, but when he does he lets out a little whine. "Why'd you stop?" "Because I have to go on stage." "You have to- no! God please no I'm so close. Don't make me beg." "You already are." "Whatever. I can be quick." "Nope. I have to go." "Hux!" Hux stoutly ignores Ben's protests, instead standing and wiping his hand across his mouth. He brushes a few specs of dirt from his knees and smooths his hair back. "I'll see you at dinner," he clips as he breezes out the door. Notes: This definitely hasn't happened lmao. If I'd sucked his dick already I wouldn't still be pining. I didn't go to prom with Matt, I went with my ex as friends and we matched black and silver because I'm a classic like that. However, it's true that Matt told me I'm making him question his sexuality, but then my Phasma friend told me he said something douchey about that so idk. Also rumors that he's slept with a few people who aren't me (there are ones about me too) so that's a little yikes. I can't really say anything about it tho because I sleep around a bit too, plus they're just stupid high school rumors. I may or may not have a problem with dating douchey boys. Jesus fuck, my life is weird enough to base a fan fic on. Chapter 6 : Cast Dinner 1; Late April Notes: Kasei - Japanese for "Mars" Jamila - Arabic for "Beautiful" check me out on tumblr! bluemilkskank.tumblr.com (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) The first thing Hux notices upon arriving at dinner is that Ben is already there. The second thing he notices is that there's no more room at the table where he's seated. An irrational jealousy wells up inside his chest and he has to batter it down. Ben has other friends, he can't always be near Hux. What really pushes Hux's buttons is that they aren't just Ben's friends, they're his friends as well. Oblivious as ever, Ben hasn't noticed him, but Kasei has. He grins at Hux and waves him over. "Hux! My knight in shining armor!" he crows, reaching out for a hug. Hux bends down and accepts the embrace, feeling smug at the quick flash of annoyance in Ben's eyes. Kasei is somehow taller than both Ben and Hux, and he's definitely broader. Unlike Ben, though, he's equal parts muscular and squishy; Ben is just pure fucking muscle. It's insanely hot and extremely unfair, but that's just Hux's life. Sans Ben, Kasei is the most attractive person Hux has ever met. His skin is so dark brown it borders on black, but he knows it's not quite there because of how black his eyes are. Said eyes reflect his half-Japanese heritage with their hooded lids and subtle slant. Despite his size, he's a sweet pacifist, Buddhist actually, and he has a smile that makes even Hux want to cuddle him. His hair is soft and always fluffed up into a faux hawk. When they first met, Kasei came across as a quiet person, but after spending more time together, he learned that Kasei has a booming laugh that echoes across galaxies and only gets louder the more he drinks. Hux dated him briefly before they both decided it just didn't work. It didn't put a damper on their friendship, and if anything strengthened it. Now, he easily slides in next to Kasei who scoots over just enough for Hux to snuggle up under his arm. He's not entirely sure what the conversation is about, but he's pretty sure they're trash talking someone. One of his exes by the sound of it. He tunes them out for the most part, sipping at Kasei's water and almost wishing he hadn't come. Ben is sulking in the chair he pulled up to the table, food forgotten. He hasn't so much as acknowledged Hux since he came in, and Hux can't decide if he's pissed or relieved. The instrument closet was a mistake, that much he knows. But he doesn't want to lose his friend. The real cherry on top comes when Ben abruptly stands and switches tables. Hux's insides feel like they're twisting up and tying in a knot. He pushes down the urge to throw up and presses more firmly against Kasei. Warm, solid Kasei who doesn't live his life to spite Hux and break his heart. Hux can't quite pinpoint the moment where heartbreak turns into panic attack, but it does, and it just pisses him off more. He hates the way his teeth grit and his jaw clenches hard enough to cramp. Hates when his vision goes fuzzy around the edges and his breathing shorts out like he's having an asthma attack. Hates his shaking hands and how he feels himself floating, the most natural high he could get, and he doesn't want it. Most of all he hates how when he presses a kiss to Kasei's cheek and stands to flee to the restroom, Ben grabs his wrist and prevents his escape. He sees Ben's mouth moving very fast, faster than he's ever seen it move, but he can't fucking hear him and isn't that just perfect? The one thing he wants to hear more than anything and it's gone. Hux shakes his head and wrenches his arm out of Ben's grip, knowing he has finger shaped bruises and not really caring. He's pretty sure he tells Ben that he's fine, but he can't be sure, not really, since he isn't fine. Right before he turns and races away, he knows his eyes project a sort of fear, and he knows that the footsteps behind him are not Ben's. The tears still haven't fallen when Hux slams the bathroom cubicle shut and bolts it. He tries to steady his breathing, refuses to actually cry over a boy. Never once has he cried from heartbreak. Not freshman year when he got dumped by a boy who couldn't even look him in the eye, instead texting him that he just couldn't date Hux anymore. Not sophomore year when the senior who took his virginity stopped him at the school elevator and told him in a monotone they were over, leaving Hux to turn and race up the stairs instead, thriving off the sharp burning in his lungs and knees because didn't he deserve that? Not junior year when the first boy who'd swept him off his feet way back in middle school contacted him and coerced him into more, assuring he had a red headed punching bag who, no matter the abuse, always had and always would say I love you. So, no, he won't cry over a boy who he hasn't even fucked or screamed at or been hit by or whatever healthy people do in relationships. Ben isn't worth that - except for at these moments where Hux can feel his mind drifting from his body, dissociating, and he needs someone to ground him. He barely registers that the door is open, and someone who isn't Ben is talking. "I'm fine, I just need a moment." The door shuts again and he's met by blessed silence. His breathing is still coming out in ragged puffs, though, and he can feel his hard exterior breaking. The first tear is hot against his chilled hand. He contemplates it for a moment, wondering how it could have possibly escaped. The last time he cried was freshman year when a close friend killed herself. Jamila he remembers. The girl with raven hair and a swan song. Very similar to Ben in that aspect, but nothing and no one can fill that particular space in his heart. A second tear falls. It's just a drop of water, something small added to the sea of Hux's regrets, but it's the drop that breaks the damn. Before Hux can stop it, the tears flood over so forcefully that choked sobs are punched out of his chest. He takes his glasses off, carefully folds them, and hurtles them against the wall. He digs his nails into his palms, bites his lip hard enough to bleed, anything to stop himself from screaming as loud as he can. His vision is swimming, and his knees feel like at least a 9 on the Richter Scale, so he collapses onto the edge of the toilet and shakes with silent tears. He almost misses the door opening because a pathetic whimper escapes his cracked lips. "Hux?" "Go away, Ben. I'm fine." "You're not fine." "I have no idea what led you to believe that." "Stop." "Stop what?" "Nothing. Being angry. I don't even know why you're angry." "I'm not angry." "Yeah you are. You only have panic attacks when you're angry." "You don't know that." "Yeah I do. Phasma told me the first time you had one around me." "Fucking Phasma. Fine. Yes, I'm angry." "At who?" "Myself." "You're such a sad person." "You're the one who punched a wall so hard you broke your pinky and just taped it to your ring finger instead of getting a real fucking splint." "That's not sad. It's anger issues and I'm working on them." "You chipped a piece off the wall." "I was wearing a ring." "Yeah but you punched it hard enough for the ring to break off a piece of brick. That's pretty sad to me that you got so angry." "But I've never gotten so angry that I can't hear or see anyone, or that my breathing almost stops. You're gonna kill yourself someday with all the panicking." "I already tried." "You what!?" "Last year. Long story short I had an abusive boyfriend in 8th grade and we got back together last year. I kind of just... lost it." "You were angry at yourself for what he did to you." "Yeah, I guess. It's bad." "Can I come in?" "If you want to crawl under the cubicle." "I'd crawl anywhere to get to you." "Well, aren't you just special." Hux glares half-heartedly at the mop of black hair that appears under the door. Ben squirms and struggles to twist his hulking frame through the small space, but eventually he succeeds and comes to kneel at Hux's feet. "What's going on?" "Absolutely nothing." "Cut the bullshit, Hux. You're not the kind of person who just runs out of the room and hides for no reason." "You don't know that." "I know that you're usually stoically calm and collected to the point of aloofness." "That's not true." "It is. And it's been getting worse. Now tell me what's wrong." "I wouldn't have excepted you to care." "What? Of course I care. I'm your friend." "Because constantly ignoring me and walking away is totally caring." "I haven't been ignoring you." "Then what do you call it when you won't even sit near me at dinner?" "That was - I wasn't - the table was full." "Ok, sure." "Hux... you know I love you." "Actually, I don't." "Well, now you do." Ben gently settles his hands on Hux's hips and looks at him imploringly. "Why are you so upset?" "I don't want to talk about it." "Did someone say something?" "No. Words don't get to me. Not anymore." "Then what does get to you?" "You." "I'm sorry." "Did you know I'm replaceable?" "No. You're wrong. You aren't replaceable in any way." "I am. No one out there would be any different if I just... disappeared. Like maybe they would miss me, but they'd get over it." "That's a lie and you know it. No one out there is over Jamila, and she died years ago. They won't get over you." "Jamila was in their lives for years. I just recently dropped into the program." "Kasei would miss you." "Kasei would miss anyone." "I would miss you." "You don't count." "Why not?" "Because you don't have any other friends." "Hey! You're so mean to me." "It's true. Everyone talks behind your back. They're scared of you, just like they're scared of Phasma and me." "Phasma would miss you." "She's got Rey." "Rey isn't you. Girlfriends and best friends are different." "Girlfriends can become best friends or vice versa." "Can I be your best friend then?" "Flirting and flattery won't fix this." "What will fix this?" "I don't know." "Hugs?" "Do you think everything can be fixed with a hug?" "Not everything." "Can this?" "I don't know." "What else could fix it?" "I don't know." "So, it's possible to fix this with a hug?" "... yeah. Yeah, we can possibly fix this with a hug." The words are barely out before Ben jerks forward and wraps his arms around Hux. One of his ridiculously large hands splays across the small of Hux's back, the other coming up to tangle in the hair at the base of his skull. Hux shudders as the fingers start to gently comb through his hair, eliciting a sigh. He relaxes into Ben's grip and clings to his jacket, not quite hugging, but still holding him in place. Ben is muttering something into Hux's shoulder - he can't really understand him, but just the sound of his voice is comforting. "I hate you," Hux mumbles as he buries his face in Ben's hair. "I know." Notes: this chapter is 100% true with slightly altered dialogue. Matt was legit willing to crawl under a stall in order to reach me and make sure I was ok. Add that to the list of reasons why I love him so. The names came from what my friends' actual names mean, like my ex's name means "Mars" and my late friend's name meant "beautiful." IRL Mars is Buddhist and mixed Latino/Black/Asian; yes, he is a gigantic marshmallow. The "knight in shining armor" line comes from the fact that I, and subsequently Hux, was a knight in the play. I did have an abusive relationship and I, like Hux, am proud to say I never shed a single tear over it. Matt/Ben is the only boy I/Hux have cried because of. I guess you could say Hux has a disability. I have hella bad knees and hella bad asthma, so now Hux has those and struggles to climb stairs. the next chapter is prolly gonna be another cast dinner, but a lot different and Ben may or may not start to show feelings for poor Hux Chapter 7 : Cast Dinner 2; Early May Notes: Nagina: African for "Pearl" check me out on tumblr! bluemilkskank.tumblr.com (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) Hux glances down at his phone as it buzzes. Nagina: Can you come help me? Hux: Probably. What's up? Nagina: I need someone here with me Hux: What's wrong? Hux: Nagina? Hux: Are you alright? Hux: Nagina? Hux: NAGINA ARE YOU ALRIGHT!? "Ben, we're going to my car." "Why?" "Nagina texted me saying she needs someone with her. She hasn't responded to any more messages, and I'm very worried. I'm going to call her, and we're going to go to her house to kidnap her." "Ok." Hux hastily throws enough money onto the table to cover both him and Ben as he dashes out. Ben follows just behind him, a safe, centering shadow. Hux spots Phasma by the entrance standing at the claw machines. "Phas, we're going to Nagina. You can either come with us or get a different ride home." "I'll come with." "Alright, well drop the machine and let's go. It might be an emergency." "Yup, I'm with ya." Hux turns on his heel and dashes to his car. He dials Nagina and tosses the phone to Ben. "Find out what's wrong while I drive." Ben nods and slides into shotgun. Phasma climbs over the driver's seat into the back, grumbling about Hux and his stupid red two-door sports car. Hux just rolls his eyes and takes the wheel. "Hello? Nagina?" ... "Yeah, this is Ben. We're on our way." ... "Hux can't talk right now. He's driving." ... "He might, but I don't know if he'll make an exception, even for you. He's a safety stickler" ... "I'm pretty sure the only way I'd ever drive his precious red Jaguar is over his dead body." ... "Yeah, I guess I can ask." The look on Ben's face tells Hux exactly what he's going to ask before he even opens his mouth. "No, Benjamin, you may not drive her." "But Huuuuuux. It's for Nagina." "I don't trust you with my baby." "It doesn't even have a name." "Her name is The Finalizer , she's red, and I love her." "You made that up." "Prove it." "I can't." "Exactly." "Please just talk to Nagina." "No. I might crash." "I have full confidence in your driving abilities." "I'm not taking a single finger off this steering wheel." "I'll hold the phone up to your ear." "Can she not go on speaker phone?" "She wants to only talk to you. She trusts you more than anyone else." "Tell her I'm on the interstate." "She's counting on you." Hux slides his gaze over to Ben and narrows his eyes. Ben has his big-eyed pout on which make Hux want to scream and punch him. And maybe kiss him, but mostly punch. After a tense moment of side-eye vs. puppy-eye, Hux caves. "Jesus, fine! Fine. Put the phone to my ear." Ben beams at him and shoves the phone against Hux's face. "Good evening, Nagina." "Hey, Hux." "What's going on?" "It's gonna sound stupid." "Nothing you say right now will sound stupid." "If I were Ben, you'd call me stupid." "Well, you're not Ben. Ben is stupid because he's Ben. Plus, he's 19 whereas you're 14." "It's still a bad reason to pull you away from the cast dinner." "Nah. Any reason from you is a good reason." "Are you sure?" A fond smile crosses Hux's face. "Yeah, kid, I'm sure." "Ok. Well, uh, I got home from the show and... uh," Nagina’s voice wavers for a second. "I found out my dog died. I knew he'd been acting weird lately, but I thought maybe he was just being weird, y'know. Weird like dogs do. I've been so busy studying for exams that I didn't even notice he'd stopped eating. Usually, he sleeps in bed with me, but earlier this week he just kinda... stopped... I thought maybe he stopped because I've been staying up too late. I didn't see this coming at all, and I just had a huge panic attack about it. And he's always the one who takes care of panic attacks, but he's dead, so I texted you. You're my only friend who would drop everything for me without a second thought.... I never took him to the vet. Even if I'd thought of it, we don't have the money." "How many times must I tell you to always ask me for money?" "I'd never be able to repay you." "You wouldn't have to. I'm quite content to blow the allowance my father grudgingly gives me per my mother's dying wishes." "But it's still your money..." "This is your therapy dog that died?" "Yeah. I mean it's ridiculous because I have another dog who's just as sweet and will sleep in bed with me too." "Nagina, sweet heart, a therapy dog or any other therapy animal, is something irreplaceable. Trust me, if Millicent ever died suddenly, I'd be devastated. I would give you a year's worth of allowance in a heartbeat to pay for any therapy animal you have." "Do you mean that, or are you just forcing yourself to be nice to me?" "Of course, I mean it, oh ye of little faith. I don't even use the money for anything except gas and food." "Ok..." "Sweet heart, we're almost at your place now. I'm going to hang up now so I can make sure we get there in one piece. We can decide what to do from there, alright?" "Alright. Thank you so much. You have no idea how much this means to me." "Anytime, dear. I'll see you in a few. Ciao." "Bye." Hux nods at Ben to cut the connection. Out of the corner of his eye, he can see that Ben still has that ridiculous smile on. "What are you smiling about?" "You're so cute when you talk to Nagina." "She's like my baby sister." "I know. You're so nice when you want to be." "Keyword 'want.' Nagina is like Jamila 2.0, and I intend to keep this Jamila alive. I failed her last time." "It's been four years, Hux. Stop blaming yourself for what happened." "I should've been with her that night. We had scheduled to see a movie together and spend a night on the town, but I had to cancel when my mother called to tell me she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. I canceled on a friend once. I'm never repeating that mistake." "You couldn't have stopped her. She was already gone, it was just a matter of when." "Damnit, Ben, didn't anyone ever tell you not to speak ill of the dead? I could have stopped her because all she needed that night was a solid shoulder and a warm hand. I should have been there then and every night after." "You can't be a coping mechanism for everyone." "Yes, I can." "No, you can't." "Can you idiots stop arguing for one moment and think about Nagina?" Phasma chimes from where she's cramped behind Hux's seat. "Phasma's right," Hux says. "We need to focus on making sure Nagina is alright." "Ok. I'm sorry, Hux." "Likewise. Now, I think the best plan of action is to get her out of the house. She needs to get away from all those memories." "That sounds smart. Where should we go?" "Well, she's only 14, so we'll have to run it by her mother first. I'd say a restaurant since she didn't get dinner and I assume she hasn't eaten since receiving the news." "Ok, so food. Where?" "Perkins is close by and open 24 hours," Phasma supplies. "Plus, it's got late night discounts and she's already comfortable there. It'll be relatively empty, and they have coffee." "Fantastic idea," Hux agrees. "We pick up Nagina and head to Perkins for a late night snack." "I don't have money," Ben and Phasma say in unison. Hux rolls his eyes when they giggle. "Don't fret, I have plenty for all of us, including Nagina." "We all owe you so much money," Phasma says without a hint of regret. "You don't owe me a penny," Hux corrects. "You pay me by voluntarily being my friends." "Lots of people would be your friend if you smiled once in a while." "I smile plenty." "You're scowling right now." "I'm concentrating on the road." "So scowling. You'd smile more if you just stopped thinking for a moment." "He can't stop thinking," Ben teases. "He's our token genius." "I'm not a genius." "What did you say your IQ was?" "145." "See? Genius." "High IQ and cleverness aren't necessarily intrinsic." "They are with you." "Give me one instance where I've exhibited genius qualities." "You took BC Calc sophomore year." "Simple memorization. Next." "You passed the SAT in 7th grade for shits and giggles." "I didn't score very well, though. Next." "You've tinkered with this car so much that now only you know how to fix it." "What can I say? I love this car. She practically glides through the air." Ben throws his hands up in exasperation. "Hux, just accept it! You're a genius" "Only in your mind." "Is my mind worth nothing?" "Your mind is golden, but it's not a solid fact." "It is to me." "Fair enough." A comfortable silence fills the car as they pull off the interstate. Phasma is smacking her gum right behind Hux's head in an attempt to either rile him up or deal with boredom. Ben is fiddling around with his knife and bobbing his head to whatever he's blaring through his headphones. Hux keeps his eyes glued to the road and tries to ignore the fact that Ben looks ridiculously attractive with a knife. "You look tense," Phasma whispers to him. Hux shrugs but otherwise doesn't respond. "I know you think he's hot with a knife." "I don't think he's hot with a knife." "Yes, you do." "You don't know my life." "You're pointedly looking away from him. You think it's hot." "Why would I think it's hot?" "Because you like getting dicked down by guys who could kill you." "I'm deeply offended." "Deeper than Ben's dick will be inside you?" "Phasma!" "Sorry sorry, just a thought." " He is in the car with us ." "He's got his music up so loud he wouldn't hear a train coming." "It's the principle of the thing." "Actually, it's you having a stick so far up your ass that I don't think it's even possible to fuck Ben.” "Excuse you, I'll have you know that Ben's cock would fit very nicely alongside the stick up my ass." "...I walked straight into that one." "That you did, my dear. Ah, look. Nagina’s already waiting for us." Hux pulls up in front of Nagina’s house and rolls the window down. "Hullo, Nagina. Care for a ride?" "Where to?" "Perkins. Check's on me." "Yeah!" Hux jabs Ben in the side to get his attention. "Ben, get out so Nagina can climb over into the back. Mind the seat, kiddo, I just got this baby cleaned." Nagina cracks a smile and salutes, then immediately turns and hugs Ben as he unfolds himself. Ben looks a little startled about the affection, but he hugs back just as tightly. Nagina pulls back grinning from ear to ear and carefully climbs into the back. "You're lucky you're 5 feet tall," Phasma complains to her. "Hux's car is too small to accommodate people over 6 foot, which is, funny enough, what he and his two best friends are." "I didn't have you two in mind when I bought it." "Yeah, but what about yourself?" "When I'm alone I have plenty of room to scoot the seat back and stretch my legs out." "You should get a new car to cater to me and Ben." "No. This is my baby, the love of my life, and I will never trade her in." "You named her The Finalizer . What is she, a battleship?" "She will be if I kick you out and run you over." "Oh, how you wound me." "Tragic." "Hey, Nagina! What are your opinions on Hux and his shitty little car?" Hux tunes Phasma out as she turns to Nagina and starts trash talking him and his poor car. It's easier to focus all his attention on ignoring Ben and his goddamn knife. "Ben, please put that away. You're going to hurt yourself or my car." "Aw, Hux, you know I'm careful." "Away." "Fine." The tension in Hux's shoulders eases once the knife is safely pocketed. He isn't even worried about his car so much as his dignity. Ben and knives should be threatening, not sexy. But with the knife stowed away, they reach Perkins with no problem besides Phasma's bitching. -- "Y'know, my father's going to have my head for staying out this late," Hux says around his coffee mug. "Sucks, man. My parents don't give a shit," Ben says with a mouthful of muffin like the heathen he is. "Well, aren't you a lucky boy. My father would find a way to complain about me no matter what the time.” "Your father sounds mean." "He's not. He's just very uptight and expects nothing less than perfection from me." "That's a tough life." "It's not all bad. His expectations allow me to be my very best. At least I'm not 19 and almost failing senior year." "I got held back in middle school, and it had nothing to do with grades." "I don't believe that." "I got suspended." "For what?" "Violence." "Y'know, that actually doesn't surprise me." "You're not gonna ask?" "I didn't realize you wanted me to." "Ask!" "What was the nature of the violence you enacted?" "Of course, you managed to make that sound all prim and proper." "Sorry. What did you do?" "I stabbed a kid with a pencil and throat chopped another one." "Why?" "They looked at me weird." "You're impossible. Remind me to never look at you weird." "You could never look at me weird. I would never hurt you." "So you say." "What?" "Nothing." Hux turns away from Ben and starts pointedly talking with Phasma. He ignores the confused look from Ben, but still tries to comfort him a little by leaning against him. Ben's arm comes to wrap around his waist and hold him close. Hux wants to punch him. "So how long have you two been together?" Nagina asks innocently. Hux glares daggers at Phasma. "I know you told her to ask that. You've corrupted her," he hisses at her stupid smug face. Then he turns to Nagina and forces a smile. "We aren't together. We're just friends." "Oh. Well, you'd be cute together." "Oh no we wouldn't." "Yeah you would. You're both really tall, but there's still a size difference. Plus, he's all weird and crazy which you could use a little of in your regimented life." "I would never date a theater kid." "And I'd never date a band kid," Ben mumbles. "Especially the brass colonel." "Colonel is a highly prestigious position in band and it will help me get music scholarships. What will sound tech help you with?" "Practical life skills." "Colonel does that, too. I have fantastic leadership skills and I'm well versed in earning respect." "Whatever. You're still a band kid." Hux and Ben both fall silent. Phasma and Nagina are talking about school, likely something to do with how annoying this teacher is or how daft that student is. None of it really interests Hux. What interests Hux is the fact that Ben has started kicking at his feet under the table. "Do you need something?" "No." "Then why are you kicking me?" "I'm playing footsies." "Pardon?" "Footsies. It's a game." "Yes, I know, but I was under the impression that it's a couple's game." "It is." Ben flicks his gaze up to meet Hux's and winks. That’s not fair, Hux thinks as his chest twists into little heart shaped knots. "I'm going to kill you," Hux says as Ben's laugh floods the restaurant and drowns the city. I love you , Hux realizes as Ben pours another cup of coffee for him. Notes: This chapter was weirdly hard to write, maybe because there wasn't a whole lot of action between Hux and Kylo. Like I only included this event in my life because there came a moment when I really thought "Oh, I might actually be in love." It was such a tame night, and sometimes at 2am things click together and people look different under the lights of a 24-hour restaurant. I think that moment came when the drinks arrived and Matt took my mug from me and poured the coffee. We have a bad habit of sharing drinks and I couldn't look away from his stupid mouth as he drank my coffee that he poured. I should've included that part in the fic but I didn't. I just couldn't put it into words because it's so fleeting and I barely remember it. We did play footsies under the table and no one else noticed and that seemed like such a moment for me. I don't think he thinks about these times as much as I do. I hate him for that sometimes. I don't actually have a sweet car, in fact I don't have any car, but I just wrote about this swag ass car I designed out of boredom during class once. Sadly, I doubt I'll ever have the money for something that nice. Chapter 8 : Play: Little Women (Musical); Early May Notes: This is a super short chapter to tide all you lovely readers over. I have finals this week so I don't have time to write anything longer, but I'm already working on the next chapter which will definitely be longer (that literal narrative took place over approximately 8 hours so lots of stuff to work with!!) check me out on tumblr! bluemilkskank.tumblr.com (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) "What the fuck is that?" The sharp slap of Ben's voice startles Hux from doing his makeup. It takes exactly three seconds for him to realize what Ben is referring to. He goes to tug the edge of his briefs down, but Ben snatches his wrist away. "I asked you a question." "It's none of your goddamn business, that's what it is." "Wha- Hux! That's. You have scars. And cuts. They're everywhere ." "No, they're not." "Get your costume on and come with me right now." "No. I need to get ready." "Bullshit. Your makeup is almost done. Your costume is easy enough. You don't even start for another 30 minutes!" "Ben." "No. You come with me. Either put some clothes on or I'm carrying you out of here in your underwear." "Fine, be like that." Hux quickly pulls his pants and undershirt on, not bothering with the button down yet. He leaves that, the bowtie, and the cummerbund neatly folded over his shoes and follows Ben out. Predictably, they wind up in the instrument room with the lights on and the door locked. "What do you want?" "Take your pants off." "Well, you're certainly forward today." "That's not what I meant. Show me the cuts." "No." "Why not?" "Because you don't need to see them to know about them. Here, I'll just tell you. There's 570 of them. They cover from the day I turned 12 until now, so that's about 7 and a half years of scars, averaging 76 per year. I've only done 38 this year since it's been almost half a year since my birthday. I made them 4 cm deep because 4 is an unlucky number and 4 inches seemed a bit excessive. They're in perfectly parallel lines organized into columns of three. 'They say all bad things come in threes.' That's from a song. It's called 'Threes' and it's by The Format. Modern music. You should check them out. Anyways. There's 285 on each leg. I always alternate evenly. Just to keep it balanced, right? Right. And they-" "Hux. Stop it." "Excuse me?" "Stop. You're scaring me. You have this all planned out and it's throwing me off." "It's just a system.” "I don't understand." "Do you want to know why?" "Why what?" "Why I know the numbers. Why it's calculated. Why I do any of it at all." "If you're offering to tell." "Are you offering to listen?" "Hux, please." "I do it for control." "Control?" "I have an overbearing yet indifferent father. I answer to teachers and directors who don't give a shit about me, and I have to do what they ask. I'm in a foreign country where my speech and habits are out of place. I had habits in Ireland. Those were ruined when we moved on my 12th birthday. So I made a new habit in America." "It's not healthy." "Sure it is. I don't lash out at walls and authority like you do. I don't exercise to death like Phasma. It helps me focus and get my work done. The whole process is catharsis and it works brilliantly." "You're destroying your body." "It's my body to destroy." "It's a sign of mental illness, you idiot." "You don't think I'm aware of that? I know what my problems are. I know that I think about things that would break my mother's heart, rest her soul. I know everything about myself and I have established coping mechanisms." "You take care of your friends but not yourself." "My friends need me. But they don't really need me. Do you understand?" "Yes. But I disagree. I need you. I need you in every way there is to need someone." "Don't you start waxing poetry at me." "I won't. Just. Let me." Ben reaches out and touches Hux's waist. He's going to kiss me Hux thinks in a panic. He jerks his head to the side so Ben's lips touch his cheek instead. To his relief, Ben doesn't pursue him. He just moves his mouth down to Hux's neck, his chest, his hips. They end up with Ben on his knees in front of Hux, undoing his pants and letting them fall to the floor. "You're wrinkling my costume," Hux sniffs. "I'm sure you'll smooth it out." Ben gently, reverently, rolls Hux's briefs up. His eyes scan across the three perfect columns on each of Hux's legs. And they are perfect. No line is crooked or out of place. The new ones are lower down and everything at the top is white scar tissue. It's a gradient. White to pink to sunset to angry red to blood. And they are still bleeding . Ben presses the sleeve of his jacket to a droplet of blood and soaks it up. His lips seek out the skin once stained and he kisses Hux. It's almost like kissing him on the lips because every cut is Hux opening his mouth to scream tears of blood and tell just Ben the story of his sorrow. And he is telling just Ben . Nobody else has seen these. If they had, Hux would have stopped. If they had, Ben wouldn't be feeling tears drop onto him from where Hux is crying above him, silent as he always is. Ben kisses his thighs again and again until the bleeding stops and his lips are stained. Sobs wrack Hux's frame and he lets Ben kiss him on the remnants of every lonely night. Hux sighs and pets a hand through Ben’s hair. "Hey, Ben?" "Yeah?" "You've ruined my makeup.” "Sorry." "I hate you." "I know." Notes: so this is a true event, but it happened earlier and it was less dramatic i guess is the word. ever since this, though, my boytoy has been super worried about me. it's kinda cute. once my phasma friend lost track of me at a band function (i was in the booth) and she called matt to ask if i was with him (he wasnt even at the school). long story short, he freaked the fuck out and called me in a panic and i laughed at him. it's nice to have someone worry about me tho. regardless, i still want to punch him sometimes, which solidifies our kylux dynamic Chapter 9 : Tri-M Clean Up Project; Late May Notes: Wow, hello, I finally got this sucker of a chapter done. If you've actually been waiting, I have a dozen excuses for being late, primarily finals and band stuff. Also I'm real fucking lazy. I think I'm only gonna do one more chapter after this. Things are coming to a close, so to speak. I promise I'll give you a happy ending, regardless of what happens in my life. I may leave it open. I have a cute ending in mind. Who knows what'll happen? Not me. Check me out on tumblr! bluemilkskank.tumblr.com (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) What’s up sucker. You’ve reached Ben Solo. I’m not here. Leave a message or get fucked. Hux lets his upper lip curl into a sneer as he glares up at Ben’s apartment building. “I’ll pick you up at 8am sharp,” he’d told Ben the afternoon before. “I will wait exactly 15 minutes and then I’m leaving. Understand?” Why on earth had he expected Ben to actually listen for once? It is now 8:12am and Ben is nowhere in sight. Not only that, but he isn’t answering his phone, and he hadn’t bothered to tell Hux which apartment number he lives in just in case he didn’t get up. Idiot. Hux dials his number once more and brings the phone to his ear. What’s up sucker. You’ve reached Ben Solo. I’m not here. Leave a message or get fucked. “Benjamin. I cannot believe I have the displeasure of chauffeuring an American brat who can’t even set an alarm. I told you 8 o’clock. It is now 8:12, and I’m leaving. I don’t think I’d be able to conjure up a more incompetent baby if I tried my damnedest. If you still want to attend the Tri-M clean up, you best hope the call comes at a convenient time for me. I’m already late. I hate you.” Hux cuts the connection, shoots one last irritated look at the building, and speeds out of the complex. He almost shudders with relief as he gets on the highway. There were more than a few people glancing hungrily at either him or his car. Quite possibly both. Nothing like creepy looking middle aged men leering at him to start the day. -- “Hullo, Ben. It’s 10:15, aka the start of your 10-minute update calls. Why start now? Because now I finally have some time to relax a bit. I have basically sterilizing both dressing rooms. That means I organized the costumes, cleaned up the makeup dust, unclogged the garbage sink in the boys’ room, and applied cleaning fluid to every surface I could reach. You could say I’ve been busy. I still have so much to do with this booth, though. So get your ass out of bed.” “Ben. It’s time for your next 10-minute update. I just cleaned up not one, not two, but three dead wasps. Do you have any idea how disgusting that is? I should have brought gloves. If you were here, I’d have made you clean them. Wake. Up.” “10 minute update time. I just killed about 50 itsy bitsy spiders and I feel terrible. They just wanted to live their lives. Their sad pitiful lives in this dumpster you and everyone who’s been in here for the past 2 years has created. I’m surprised I never inhaled anything toxic in the time we’ve spent here.” “Since some of us can’t tell time, I’ll be your talking clock that’s here to say it’s time for your 10-minute update. Did you know that someone has been using the back corner underneath the sound and light board table as a trash can for their sunflower seeds? I cleaned that shit up with my bare hands. Not even mentioning how unsanitary that is, it’s a tragedy that no one was here to see me on my hands and knees with my ass in the air. Now you know what you’re missing.” “It’s been 10 more minutes. I have picked up so many food wrappers and vacuumed every corner I can reach. I hope Phasma didn’t want her report card because I took a lighter I found to it. I also hope you don’t want said lighter back, and I know it’s yours because it has a skull and crossbones on it because I’m keeping that shit. Even though I’m asthmatic and don’t smoke. I can use it for things like setting annoying American brat children on fire .” “I can’t believe I’m still doing this. I should just abandon you and let you wake up with the knowledge that you did nothing to help me clean the booth. I should fuck up all this equipment and pin it on you. I swear, if I find out you’re sleeping in because you got blackout drunk last night, I will murder you. Haul your sorry ass out of bed so I can bodily injure you.” “Hi. It’s me. Hux. I’m sitting on the roof and relaxing for a moment. I’m not really mad at you. I’m just frustrated. I kind of wanted to spend the day with you. And I’m getting jittery because I can only get the booth partially cleaned. I probably have OCD. I mean, I was never diagnosed, but it was a close thing. It doesn’t matter. I love you. Please hurry and get up so I can pick you up.” “Ben. I’m mad again. Not really, but almost. It really is filthy up here. I don’t even want to know how old some of these drinks are, and I, unfortunately, looked at the expiration date on a box of cookies. If ‘yikes’ were an emotion, I’d be feeling it right now.” “Ben. Hi. I’m really not mad. But Sima stopped by to see what was going on, and she told me which apartment you live in. I’m headed over now. I will drag your ass out the door in your underclothes if I have to, so be prepared to wake the fuck up. Love you.” -- Hux pounds on the door as hard as he can. Like a police officer Sima said. With that in mind, Hux curls his hand into a fist and forcefully slams the side of it against the door. He starts when a woman snaps at him through the door. “Who is it?” “Uh. Does Benjamin Solo live here?” “Yes. Who are you?” “My name is Hux. I’m a friend of his. He was supposed to come to the school today for a clean up project. I’ve come to wake him up.” The door cracks open and a short, scowling woman looks up at him. Her hair is greying at the temples and wrinkles are forming at the corners of her eyes, but she evidently still has the fire of youth burning in her if her posture is anything to go by. Hux awkwardly extends his hand to shake. She regards him warily for a moment before accepting. “Ben just woke up. He’s throwing on some clothes right now and panicking.” “Ah, good. So he does feel some sense of urgency.” “You must be some friend to make him rush.” “I don’t think it’s so much me as the obligation he made, ma’am.” “Hmph. Those never encouraged him before. I think it’s you, son.” “Well, I’m flattered, ma’am.” “If you’re the ginger he’s always gushing about, he’s probably in love.” “I’m sure you’re thinking of someone else.” “There must be a multitude of Irish redheads as school, then.” “Must be.” “Hux, I’m so sorry, I slept in, I can explain,” Ben blurts as he dashes past his mom and into Hux’s arms. Hux glares disdainfully down at the heap of Solo crumpled against him and sighs. “Thank you for your time and your son, ma’am,” he says to Ben’s mom instead of acknowledging the man himself. “I’ll be sure to return him in one piece.” “Oh, no, feel free to tear him apart and return him in a bucket,” she laughs. “I’ve been wondering if he has enough willpower to just reassemble himself for the longest time. He’s that stubborn.” “Mooooom,” Ben groans, dramatic as always. Hux will never understand why Ben isn’t an actor; he’s certainly expressive enough. “Sorry, sweetie.” “It’s fine. Bye, love you.” Ben detangles himself from Hux’s embrace to give him mom a quick kiss and dash out to the car. Hux shrugs a shoulder when she raises a knowing eyebrow. “It was a pleasure meeting you, Miss - ?” “Just call me Leia. And the pleasure is all mine.” Hux nods curtly and heads toward the car. Ben must have already taken the liberty of hooking his music up because the bass pumping through the speakers is definitely not to Hux’s tastes. “Turn down that blasted noise. You’ll ruin our hearing. Did you know that the hair receptor cells in the cochlea can’t be replaced once flattened? We are not zebrafish.” “What do zebrafish have to do with anything?” “They can regenerate hair cells.” “I want to say ‘cool!’ but I also really need to ask. Why the hell do you know that?” “Because I research in my free time, whereas you just lay in bed and do your best to send me annoying texts that interrupt my research.” “You love me for it.” “Actually, I don’t. Speaking of which, your mother thinks you’re in love with me.” “Maybe I am.” “Then your intentions are misplaced and you should look elsewhere.” “Aww Hux, don’t be like that. I love you!” “No you don’t, you love my blowjobs.” “Those too.” “Right.” “Hey, wanna hear a cool song?” “If it’s by My Chemical Romance I’m going to punch you.” “You can’t punch me. Both hands on the wheel Sir Huxalot.” “Please, never call me that again.” “Coppertop. Carrot Cake. Matchbox.” “Stop.” “I can’t. I’m on a roll.” “You’ll be on that yellow line in the middle of the road if you don’t watch yourself.” “Damn. Violence.” “Did you listen to my messages?” “Yeah.” “Do you remember the note about bodily injuring you?” “I was hoping you’d forget about it, actually.” “Well, I haven’t.” If Hux relishes the terror in Ben’s eyes, well, he doesn’t worry about it. Ben is a big boy, a very big boy, and can handle a little jostling. With that in mind, Hux carefully takes his right hand off the wheel and jabs his fist at Ben’s abdomen a couple times. He’s almost surprised Ben doesn’t make a move to stop him. “I deserved that.” “Indeed. I don’t make hollow threats.” “Yeah, I got that.” “I do it out of love.” “You have no love in you.” Rather than answer, Hux lets his mouth curve up into a suggestive smile and flicks his eyes at Ben’s crotch. It takes him a moment, but Ben gets the innuendo and pulls a face. “Dude, gross. I don’t want to know about it.” “Not even ‘who’?” “Does it matter?” “It was an ex.” “Yup, I was right. Definitely doesn’t matter.” “They paid me.” “Good for you.” “Still jealous?” “I’m not jealous, and I wouldn’t pay.” “Of course not. You never have.” “Would you try and make me?” “Theoretically? Yes. In practice? Probably not. Don’t think that makes you special.” “Wouldn’t dream of it.” “Now turn that blasted noise off.” “I’d rather not. Here, you might like this!” Hux groans as Ben starts swiping through his phone. 10 more minutes of this shit and you’ll be back at school he reminds himself in order to take his mind off potentially killing his best friend. He ignores whatever it is Ben is convinced he “might like,” even if the beat is admittedly catchy. No need to give Ben the satisfaction of knowing his music is sometimes tolerable. For once in his life, Ben seems to realize that Hux isn’t going to admit he likes any of the songs. Instead, he clicks around to find songs Hux might laugh at. He succeeds exactly once. By the time they reach the school, Hux is humming along to some stupid Disney soundtrack that Ben had pulled up. Ben is belting at the top of his lungs. He doesn’t sound very pleasant, but he’s doing the best he can. It’s cute at first, but once they reach the booth Ben’s been going on so long that Hux is toeing the line between annoyed and pissed. He grabs the sock he’d previously been dusting with and shoves it Ben’s mouth. Being the idiot he is, Ben chews on it for a second before realizing what it’s covered in. He pulls a face and spits it out. “What the fuck!? That’s so nasty. You could’ve just asked me to stop.” “You wouldn’t have listened. Here.” Hux holds out his water bottle and watches Ben drain at least half of it. He grimaces and wipes it off when it’s handed back. “Better?” “Much. The booth looks nice.” “Of course it does. I cleaned it. Band kids always get it done." “Pompous ass.” “American brat.” “Thanks. What do you need me to do?” “Organize those cabinets.” “And what are you gonna do?” “I’m going to sit here and look pretty. I’ve done quite enough while you were asleep.” “I was really tired.” “Please don’t tell me you got drunk and were just hungover.” “Nah, not this time. I was at my cousin’s birthday party.” “Rey?” “Yeah. She had a huge get-together. I think I saw Phasma, but they both disappeared pretty early on.” Ben stops to make a face. Hux finds it stupidly cute. “I don’t want to think about where they went.” “I wonder if Phasma would send me pictures if I asked.” “Wha - no! Why would you say that?” Hux delicately shrugs one shoulder. “To bother you.” “You really are the biggest prick.” “Ah, you caught me. I was trying so hard to keep it a secret. I guess I am what I eat.” “Hux!” “What? You should be used to me saying that. Phasma is.” “Phasma’s known you longer, and you’re a lot less uptight around her.” “Only because we’re in the trumpet section together. We have an understanding. You’re just a tech for the shows I act in.” Hux laughs as Ben feigns hurt, placing one large hand over his heart and pulling a puppy dog face. Hux can’t resist - he reaches out and ruffles Ben’s hair. Ben ducks away and swats at Hux’s hand. “Leave me alone, man. I’m trying to work.” “Hmm, I guess that’s a good reason. For once. Happy cleaning,” he singsongs, leaning back and primly crossing his legs. Ben lets his gaze linger on them a split second too long before he tears his eyes away. Hux laughs and snaps a picture of the look on his face. -- “Huuuuux,” Ben whines, dragging himself out from the open cabinet. “Hmm?” Hux glances up from his phone. Ben is lying in a little pile of rumpled clothes and messy hair, sticking his thick bottom lip out in a pout. He’s been working for several hours, only stopping once for a short snack and bathroom break. Hux suspects he’s trying to make up for being late. His eagerness to please is endearing. “Can we go home now? I’m basically done.” “That depends on what you mean by ‘basically.’ I want you to be completely done.” “All I’d have to do is dust in here, and I don’t want to. It’ll just get dusty again.” “You have a point… I suppose no one’s going to get upset at a little dust.” “Really!?” “Yes, really . What did you think I was going to say?” “I dunno. I just didn’t expect you to say yes.” “I told you before, I’m bad at saying no.” “You’re good at saying no to my music.” “That’s different. There are nothing good about your music. Except for some of the soundtracks. Those are tolerable.” “You’re not tolerable.” “I know. Which is why I have about 5 friends. Now stop whining, and get your ass up.” “You’re the best. I’m totally in love with you.” “We’ll see about that. Come come. I have places to be after I drop you off.” “What kind of places?” “A movie date for starters.” “A… date?” “Well, technically yes. One of my exes is having ‘Hux withdraw’ so to speak. So we’re going out to dinner and movie.” “That is… not healthy.” “Oh, no, it’s perfectly fine. I hook up with exes all the time.” “You’re terrible.” “And they’re not? Look, it’s just an easy lay, nothing more. Don’t give me that look.” “What look?” “The one where you can’t decide if you want to be jealous or angry that I chose to live the way I do. It’s not a pretty look. Now, come on before I leave you here.” Hux turns and walks out of the booth, shutting all the lights off behind him. Ben is still grumbling, but he tunes him out. Honestly, he still doesn’t understand what makes Ben so worried about him. He’s 18, he can take care of himself. The 10 minute ride to Ben’s place is tense, and when he gets out, he grabs Hux’s hand and places a kiss to his knuckles. Hux glances over, surprised, and is met with a slammed door and Ben’s retreating back. He drives off and starts to wonder if Ben might really be in love. Notes: If you spent the chapter wondering what Tri-M is, it's basically a chorus/band honors program. I haven't been inducted (yet), but I still went and worked on the booth because one of my best friends asked me to. Matt was late, per usual, and I left 10 messages for him while he slept. I tried to write them from memory as best I could. In reality I said "wapses" in reference to the dead wasps because I have an... eccentric friend group that doesn't always like the establishes English langue. Seriousl, says wasps and then wapses. The latter is much easier on the tongue. Oh, and Matt truly lives in a seedy area of town, and I feel like a lil baby twink when I swing by. So many heebie jeebies. And his mom is not actually a Leia figure, but I wasn't about to make Leia a complete ass who probably smokes crack. It's true, I have a really bad habit of hooking up with my exes. I've already worked through two in the few weeks school's been out. Yikes, someone slap me. Someday I will stop oversharing nasty details about my life on the internet. Chapter 10 : Dressing Room; Last Day of School Notes: sorry i haven't updated in a while. i've had a lot going on and also i love procrastinating. anyways, i literally didnt edit this so sorry for everything shitty. but its done! check me out on tumblr! bluemilkskank.tumblr.com (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) “So,” Phasma begins as she casually corners Hux in the instrument room. “We’re graduating tomorrow.” “Yes, I know. I keep a calendar.” “That’s not what I’m talking about.” “Really? I was so sure you were reminding me about graduation because I’m so forgetful. ” “Y’know you don’t have to be such a jackass all the time.” “I’m not.” “Oh, right. You’re only nice when Benny Boy is around. Which is, incidentally, what I’m here for.” “You could’ve just said ‘let’s gossip about Ben’ instead of reminding me about graduation.” “I was trying to be subtle.” “Well, stop trying because you’re absolutely dreadful at it.” “Jackass.” “Thanks. So Ben.” “Yeah, Ben. Have you two hooked up yet?” “What do you qualify as ‘hooking up?’ Because I’ve given him plenty of blowjobs already. And a lap dance. But we aren’t… we aren’t an item.” “Well, have you even like, kissed him?” “No. Our relationship is purely sexual. Kissing is… too intimate. I don’t kiss people.” “Huh. Ok, that’s kinda what I wanted to know. I already hear about all your sexual encounters because Ben doesn’t know when to shut the fuck up about you. It’s kind of annoying. He literally never stops talking about you.” “I’m flattered? Why are you telling me this?” “Because you’re both the most emotionally stunted humans on this planet.” “I’m not sure I follow you.” “Do I seriously need to spell this out?” “Probably. I’m not very good at taking hints.” “Ugh, fine. He’s in love with you, you fucking idiot, but he is never gonna make an actual move .” “What does this have to do with me!?” “I really hope you’re kidding.” “Wha - oh! Oh, fuck Phas. You’re right, I’m an idiot. I have to - I mean. I need. Fuck. Where is he right now?” “Boys’ dressing room. Here.” Phasma fishes around in her purse and shoves a couple square packets into Hux’s hand. “Be safe, don’t get pregnant, and please don’t let his ridiculously monstrous dick demolish you.” “You disgust me.” “Hey, I’m not the one having boy problems. Go get ‘em, big guy. I’m skipping school with Rey.” “She’s a junior, don’t get her in too much trouble. She has to return next year.” “It’s sweet of you to worry, but she cares about getting in trouble as much as Ben does. Now scram, cupcake. We’ve got places to be.” Hux groans and buries his face in his hands. Leave it to Phasma to embarrass him beyond belief. He glares at the packets in hand as if the condoms are at fault for his current emotional crisis. With a resigned huff, he slowly heads for the dressing room. When he arrives, Ben is sprawled out on the couch eating an apple. He has his phone in the other hand with his headphones on, so he doesn’t notice Hux’s arrival. Hux strides over and sits on the edge of the couch in the vicinity of his knees. Ben finally looks up and takes his headphones off. “Hey, man. What’s up?” “Phasma told me you’d be in here.” “Really now? Where’s she at?” “She left with Rey.” “Dude, gross. I bet they’re at my place which I really don’t want to think about.” “Then think about something else.” “Like what?” “I don’t know. You could contemplate all the things that could possibly go wrong and result in one or all of us not graduating.” “... Why are you like this?” “Like what?” “Like…” Ben waves his hand around in the general direction of Hux. “That.” “Your specificity never fails to impress me,” Hux deadpans. Ben just snorts and throws a hat at him. Hux catches it deftly and inspects it. It’s from their last musical, Little Women, and was used for one of the storybook characters, Rodrigo. It’s basically a black cavalier hat with a big red feather on the side. Hux places it on top of his head and mimes holding a sword. “Unhand that woman, villain!” He jumps to the other side of the room and takes up a different character. Braxton. “Who are you !?” He jumps back and scats the instrumental intro. Then, raising his voice above Ben’s laughter, he breaks into song. “I am your destiny // Your bitterest foe // I’ve come to avenge your crimes // of 10 years ago!” He crouches and pretends to address the woman, Clarissa. “Run to the forest! Run!” He pitches his voice into a nasally falsetto and drops to the floor, sweeping off the hat. “I can’t! The forest is dangerous . My sister went in there and never returned!” He jumps back to his feet, puts the hat back on, and extends a hand as if helping Clarissa up. “You must risk it. You must take the dark path. Your fate awaits you!” Jump to the other side of the room: Braxton. “She will never escape me!” Rodrigo. “Hurry!” He levels his pantomime sword at Rodrigo. Braxton. “En garde!” He jumps back and points Rodrigo’s sword, still addressing Clarissa. “Go! Now!” He removes the hat and lets out a high pitched screen before pretending to flee. Then, he pantomimes an epic sword fight. He takes up Rodrigo’s character and lunges at his foe. “Aha!” “I don’t know you,” Ben wheezes from where he’s giggling on the couch. “Who are you and what have you done with my Hux?” “I think sometimes you forget that I’m an actor. And a good one at that.” “But like… That was wild!” Hux shrugs. “I was just reenacting a scene.” “As three characters. One of them in falsetto.” “During the show, I would do this backstage with Kasei and Nagina. I was Clarissa.” “Wow. I’m actually not as surprised as I should be. Let me guess. Kasei was Braxton, you just wanted an excuse to have him hold you against him, and Nagina wanted to be the good guy because she’s just that adorable." “You know us so well.” “It’s my job as a tech to know my actors.” “Oh, so that’s why we’re friends,” Hux teases, flopping onto the couch. “You just needed to know your actor.” “Yeah. And you’re my favorite actor.” “Hmm.” “What?” “Nothing.” “Ok.” “Hey, Ben?” “Yeah?” “Nevermind.” “Ok.” “Wait.” “What?” “Close your eyes.” “Why?” “Because... Nevermind, It doesn't matter. Leave them open if you’d like.” “Why?” “Shut up.” “Why?” “God, you never listen do you?” “Why should I listen to y - “ Hux cuts him off by pressing their lips together. Ben, damn him, doesn’t even miss a beat. He just leans in and lets his mouth open a little. His lips, my god his lips, they’re so soft Hux thinks. Something warms bubbles into Hux’s chest and he just can’t fight it anymore. Not when he has his mouth on Ben’s and their tongues are tentatively starting to touch. It’s electric. Hux’s head goes pleasantly hazy, and he’s reminded why he doesn’t kiss people he’s in love with. A strand of Ben’s hair falls out of the loose ponytail it’s tied up in and tickles Hux’s face. He grins against Ben’s mouth because he’s so soft . His hair, his lips, his kisses. He’s soft and comforting and Hux will never understand why people are scared of him. At first, Hux thinks the soft noises filling the room are Ben’s because it makes sense - Ben is emotional, Ben is loud - but they’re his own. Ben slides a hand into the short hair at the base of his skull, and he actually whimpers . Pathetic. So Hux reaches up and tugs Ben’s hair out of the elastic so he can grip it and pull in retaliation. Ben groans and hauls Hux into his lap. “God, you’re so strong,” Hux whispers as he rocks his hips against Ben’s. Ben just groans again and thrusts up. Hux’s breath catches when Ben brings his hands up and grips Hux’s waist, his fingertips nearly touching at the small of his back. Ben seems just as surprised by the size difference, and he gives Hux a little squeeze. Hux snorts out a laugh and bends down to suck at Ben’s neck. “Hux,” Ben whispers, groping blindly at Hux’s ass. “Please tell me you have condoms.” “Yeah, I do. If you have lube.” “Fuck, yeah I do. Here, get up for a second.” They awkwardly untangle and stand, Ben immediately shucking off his shirt and pants. Hux takes a moment to stare at the masterpiece before him. Ben’s muscles are basically sculpted from marble. Of course, he already knew this. Ben spends a lot of time shirtless. But it’s different right now. Right now he’s allowed to stare and he doesn’t feel creepy or worry about Ben noticing. He almost doesn’t want to take his own clothes off because Ben is amazing and Herculean whereas his own physique is rather lacking. He’s skinny and soft around the edges, his skin is almost sickly, and he definitely isn’t as hung as Ben is. Hux almost chokes on air when Ben drops his briefs. “How big is that ungodly thing!?” “What? My dick?” “Yes, your dick. What the fuck else could I be talking about?” “I dunno. Last I checked it was 8 inches hard. 5 inches in circumference.” “So… so you’re telling me that… that thing... is 8 inches long, about… 1.5 inches in diameter, and… and I’m putting that inside my body!?” “I mean, we don’t have to do this right now. We can just like,” Ben makes a vague jerking off motion with his hand and sits back on the couch. “Why are your clothes still on?” “Because I’m feeling very self-conscious right now.” “Aww. Hey, don’t worry about it. I know you’re not ripped. And I don’t really expect your dick to be the same size as mine. That’s not a very fair standard. Not to brag or anything. Just… c’mere. I’ll help.” Hux obediently walks over to Ben and stands between his knees. Ben reverently traces a hand from his shoulder to his fingertips. And when he lifts Hux’s shirt off, he presses a dozen little kisses to his stomach, enraptured by the softness and prominent ribs. “You are so beautiful,” he breathes against Hux’s skin. His hands fumble with his belt and pants for a second before those too drop away. Ben doesn’t wait at all to grab Hux’s briefs and yank those down too. He grins at the neatly trimmed red hairs. “I love redheads.” “Yes, I noticed,” Hux sneers, threading his fingers through Ben’s hair. “Let me go so I can lock the door.” “What? Scared of getting caught?” “Yes, very much so. I have my dignity to keep intact. And there’s still time to lose scholarships and honor cords.” “Psh. I don’t have any of those.” “Well, I do. So let me go.” Ben sighs but relinquishes his grip on Hux’s hips. “Fine. Lock the door, smarty pants. You can have your smart people things.” “Trust me, you’re smart, too,” Hux tosses over his shoulder as he walks to the door. “You’re just lazy as shit.” “Yeah I know. Hey, nice butt.” Hux glares when Ben throws a pen at it. Ben cracks up and sits back, patting his lap. “Come sit on my dick, Gingerbread. I know you want to ride me. You’d take my cock all day long if you could, wouldn’t you?” Hux bites back a groan but fails to stop the blush that spreads all over his body. Ben smirks and crooks his finger in a come-hither motion. Hux curses himself for obeying. “Stop dirty talking me, and get to work,” he practically snarls. “And don’t call me any of your stupid pet names.” Ben just laughs and rolls a condom on. He opens a little packet of lube and places another few next to him. “Lay across my lap.” “No.” “Do you want to be fucked dry then?” “No.” “Well, the most practical way for me to prep you in this position is for you to lay across my lap.” “You could always have me on my hands and knees or bent over the back of the couch.” “Yeah, but it’s much more fun if you’re bent over my knee.” “I honestly hate you.” “I hate you, too. Now bend over.” “Brat.” Hux scowls and carefully lays himself over Ben’s legs, positioning himself so that his stomach and thighs are supported, and his dick lays heavy between Ben’s knees. A second after he hears Ben squirt some lube out, a large finger pushes at his entrance. Instinctively, he tenses at the intrusion but forces himself to relax when Ben soothes a hand over the back of his thighs. “You look so pretty,” Ben praises, dragging his free hand over Hux’s as s and rubbing circles at his lower back. “I bet you’ll just split in half when I fuck you.” “Honestly, shut up,” Hux gasps. “I don’t want to hear your disgusting words right now. Just prep me and get it over with.” “You’re the bitchiest bottom I’ve ever slept with.” “Yeah, well maybe I wouldn’t be so bitchy if you were a little nicer.” “I am being nice. I’m just talking dirty.” “Well, stop it and just get a move on. I’m not a fucking virgin. I’m not gonna break if you go a little faster.” “Yes, sir.” Hux groans in relief when Ben immediately presses a second finger in. It burns, toeing the line between pain and pleasure, and Hux relishes it. Ben gently scissors his fingers and pours more lube directly into Hux, causing him to cry out and buck his hips. The movement presses his dick against the inside of Ben’s thigh, sending sparks of pleasure through his body. Ben’s free hand dances up his spine and rests at his neck; he brushes his fingertips just below his hairline, causing Hux to whimper. Ben huffs out a laugh. “I always forget how sensitive the back of your neck is. You’re so easy.” “Yes, well. That’s not much of a secret. Now stop talking.” “Pushy.” “Ben.” “Sorry.” Ben smacks Hux’s ass and returns to his former task. He wriggles his two fingers around, searching and stretching, until he finally finds Hux’s prostate. When he does, his face splits into a grin and he rubs at it mercilessly to make Hux squirm and bite his lip to stifle his moans. It’s almost as if he wants to see Hux surrender before he fucks him. Which, knowing Ben, that’s exactly what he’s doing. He’s waiting for Hux to beg and fuck himself back on his fingers, but like hell that’s going to happen. Hux snarls and reaches back, batting Ben’s hand out of the way to work himself open. He can’t help feeling smug when Ben’s breath catches. “Holy shit, you’re amazing.” “Don’t patronize me while I’m fingering myself.” “What? No, I mean that. I love you.” “Isn’t it a little early to be dropping the L-word.” “No. It’s never too early for love. Plus I’ve been saying it for a long time. You just blew me off as joking.” “Yes, well. I thought you were making fun of me.” “Why would I do that?” “Because I’ve liked you ever since I saw you and I fell in love with you shortly after. I’m not usually this attached.” “I… oh. I didn’t even know. I’m attached too if that helps. We should get married.” “No, we absolutely shouldn’t get married because I’m going to college and we won’t be around each other as much.” “I didn’t mean right away. I just mean… I think you’re the one.” “And I think you’re delusional. Here, sit back. Let me ride you while I consider your proposal.” Ben scrambles to do as he’s told, allowing Hux to move until he’s straddling his lap and positioned over his dick. They both let out a groan as Hux slowly sinks down, adjusting to the burn of taking an 8-inch dick. “Jesus Christ, you’re huge,” Hux moans once he’s bottomed out. He rocks his hips back and forth, just testing the waters. Ben grunts appreciatively and moves in time with Hux. “I’m seriously thinking I should keep you tied up in my room and fuck myself on you whenever I can.” “You could have me forever if we got married.” “Ok, I get it, you want to marry me. Now stop ruining the mood and keep your big mouth shut.” Hux cuts off Ben’s response by beginning to bounce with fervor. Ben ends up letting out a strangled sound that may or may not have been Hux’s name and grabs onto Hux’s hips as if he’s a life preserver. Hux can’t stop the heat that shoots through him at the size and strength of those hands, and he just barely restrains himself from begging Ben to just fuck him like there’s no tomorrow. As if reading his mind, Ben easily flips them so that Hux is on his back and Ben is tilting his hips up and practically jackhammering into him. The new angle ensures that Hux’s prostate is stimulated with every thrust, and it’s not long before he’s crying out and spilling over his own stomach. Ben keens when Hux clenches down around him, and after a few more thrusts spills himself deep inside Hux. They collapse onto the couch, breathless and satisfied, Ben still nestled inside Hux’s body. “Get out of my ass, you oaf.” “Can’t. Too tired.” “You’re useless.” Ben just grunts in what could be protest or agreement, but he doesn’t stop Hux from pulling away and starting to clean up. He takes the condom off Ben and tosses it in the bin for an unlucky student to find later, then leans over the couch and grabs Ben’s shirt to wipe the mess of both of them. Ben mumbles a weak defense of his shirt into Hux’s shoulder which is ignored when Hux continues to clean up with it. When he’s finished, he lays back against Ben and threads their fingers together. “Hey, Ben?” “Yeah.” “I love you.” “Will you marry me?” “...Shut the fuck up.” Notes: so.... i'll let yall decide if this really happened or not ;)
