In another life I’d bring you flowers Orange lilies, for hatred first clung to And amaryllis for what I proudly thought true That you were weak Easily broken I would give a token Of daffodils For the sun that you are And iris for the stars You awoke in my dark heart Snow-dusted pine belies the hope I had buried in woe Hydrangea for my heartlessness And for all of my cruelty, marigold White heather for wishes untold Thousands of purple hyacinths for the sorrow I caused Flawless zinnias For your goodness And for your quiet, regal strength I’d give gladiolus Ah, but to describe your beauty No flower could accomplish that I’d give you fields of red poppies instead In the hope you’d understand Your presence is both an indulgence And endless happiness had In another life Perhaps flowers would have been enough I’d have planted a fir tree For time together spent And a sea of anemones When your absence my heart had rend Apple blossoms For promises I’d keep Forget-me-nots Woven in your hair while you sleep For you to remember me Even while you dream But only jonquil, for desire As my soul craved yours from the start And carnations the colour of fire For how I ache when you depart Yet I think, only a rose Could convey And make you believe These words I could never say That with every part of my darkness I love you Always In another life I’d have stayed forever Finally, at the centre And this I speak true A single primrose For in this life or another I cannot live without you
