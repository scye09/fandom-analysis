Finn wakes up each morning, greeted with the voice of his space bird singing in the shower. The former trooper stretches his limbs, getting all the aches from sleep settled out. The Rebellion's starships' beds are truly no different than the The First Order's. At least their status saves them from sharing quarters with other crew members. The space is cramped as is. He slides open the window cover next to the shared bed and watches the stars pass by. He reminds himself to check the coordinates later to see what galaxy they are in. The change in lyrics interrupt his thoughts. He smiles, remembering fondly the song played during his and Poe's first date. He feels at home in this ocean of stars and his cosmic siren. His cosmic siren who currently belts a key incredibly off tune. Everyone, including Finn, refuses to divulge to Poe on how he truly sounds. Finn leaves to make coffee.
