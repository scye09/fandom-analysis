Just because Finn had been able to break through the Stormtrooper brainwashing, didn’t mean that he had forgotten the training, the conditioning. Poe and Rey could touch him. They were allowed. But Rey was gone, so only Poe could touch him now – had earned the right when he gave Finn his name and his freedom, when he pulled Finn in close and said, “Everything’s okay, you did such a great job.” So when Snap Wexley comes up behind him and throws his arm around Finn’s shoulder – Finn becomes a blur of movement and the pilot is suddenly on the ground screaming, his arm dislocated and his wrist snapped. Finn may be part of Resistance now, but he had been a Stormtrooper first. Notes: I don't even go here, but this ship has taken hold of me.
