"Thank you very much for the use your kitchen, Mr. Organa," Ms. Garcia proclaimed cheerfully as they reentered the house, embracing him and brushing his cheeks with her lips in what he figured was a common greeting or affection in some circles. Notes: Gosh, sorry to anyone who tried to read this! The only partially typed draft was about to expire last night and I also tried to fix it earlier this morning but couldn't. The only thing that worked was the "Post Draft" button. I believe I was subject to a temporary problem with the editor where e.g. the tags never resolved into a field of tags vs a list in the entry box; non-selected options were still displaying all the associated entry boxes; and, most importantly, trying to submit changes took an inordinate time and when left alone to finish ultimately gave minor connection errors. Since things are looking right again here behind the scenes, I'm hoping this explanatory note will post and then I should be able to type up the rest of this properly within the day!
