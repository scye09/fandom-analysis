It’s been months of… of… flirting? Courting? Circling one another like two predators thinking the other is prey. Hux’s balls might not actually be blue, but they feel it. He knows Kylo wants this. He knows in a way he’s never been sure anyone wanted him before. And in a way he’s never wanted someone before. Knows . In his bones, and his boner. They progressed from fighting to… something sort of amicable, to… being close. To physical proximity to… tension. Hux is sure Kylo wants it, from the blown irises and plump lips. The red cheeks and ears, the way his eyes follow Hux’s mouth in return. Fingers that touch and pull back, and - he - does , doesn’t he? Or is he misreading it? He thought the electric jolts were… “ I shouldn’t ,” Kylo hisses. “It’s forbidden.” Hux pauses, his hand on Kylo’s knee. From ‘does he really want this or am I being a lecherous pervert’ to ‘what the ever-living-fuck?’ “What?” “I’m… it’s… I can’t.” Can’t is different to ‘do not want’, but it is still a negative. Hux wills his own boner down, crossing his legs. “Because… of the Force?” Kylo nods, and looks close to tears. “…why? You’re not a Jedi…” “I don’t… the Leader… he says affection is a distraction.” “So. Jedi can’t love because it’s a conflict of interest, and you can’t love because you’re busy ?” Kylo tries to pull back, and Hux lets him retreat to the other side of the couch. He doesn’t understand at all, and now he feels like a fucking shit. “I already do love you,” Kylo whispers, pulling his knees up to his face. “So I’m already…” He’s never said it before. Never admitted to… that . Months of eating together, sharing spaces, talking, relaxing. All their misadventures, and now Kylo’s saying… “Is it something… you want?” Hux asks, unable to engage with the other thing just yet. “Or is it something you’re not interested in?” “…is… is it wrong to say I don’t know?” Kylo asks. “I… haven’t, so I don’t… I don’t know if I…” Hux scoots just a tiny bit closer, and leans in. He pushes Kylo’s hair back neat, and kisses his temple. He feels the meeping sounds shake the couch, and he sits back down with a sliver of space between them. “No. I’m… sorry I pushed. I thought you were just shy.” “I… want to. I think. I just…” “Shouldn’t?” Hux turns his hand over, offering his palm. Kylo hesitates before taking it. He nods, then puts his head on his shoulder. “If I’m already against orders, does that mean you want… to stop?” A shake, and a nose under his jaw. “…then… if you want to, and I want to… at least try, I mean…” It’s not that he needs to have sex with him. It’s just that he wants to, and it would be nice if they could. “What if I’m terrible at it?” Kylo asks, his voice… weirdly innocent. Hux laughs. “Follow my lead and we’ll be fine, I’m sure. Half of sex is about letting your partner know what’s good, anyway.” Or, so he’s heard. “Not tonight,” Kylo begs. “But. Sometime?” Hux smiles into Kylo’s hair. “I’d like that a lot.” “You’ll be gentle?” “Always,” Hux promises. Because. Well. Kylo matters .
