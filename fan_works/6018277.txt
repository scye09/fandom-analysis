The damaged Tie fighter was quickly approaching the surface of Jakku, so Poe decided to take his shot. "Got a boyfriend, a cute boyfriend?" he hollered at the man he'd recently named Finn. "Boyfriend? What's a boyfriend?" Finn yelled back in a panic. That sand was getting really close, and sand is terrible. Especially when you approach it at the speed they were currently traveling. "It's like someone you like a lot and spend time with. Hold hands, you know?" Finn didn't. He pondered briefly. "Huh," he said seconds before he was automatically ejected and lost consciousness. Notes: I don't know if someone did this already, but I couldn't help myself. Kudos and comments are always appreciated :)
