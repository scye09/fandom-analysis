Kylo Ren was sitting on the chair staring the charred remains of Darth Vaders helmet he had begone wearing his own mask more often only taking it off to allow the slave girl he captured Jano he employed her as his personal maid only she was allowed to apply that awful stinging liquid to prevent infection, "Im sorry grandfather I'm failing you, failing your legacy I owe everything I am to you and yet I continue to disappoint I am sorry but I promise I will destroy a thousand worlds in your name if I must show me grandfather" he said dropping to his knees from the chair "Show Me ! Show ME ! The dark side !". The spirit of Anakin Skywalker appeared from the shadows a pale blue aura shown around the hooded distorted figure half his body was black metal and his face was torn and distorted with like skin had been torn off to reveal the black of Darth Vader beneath, "Grandfather" Kylo said with barley a whisper "why do you summon me" the spectre echoed "the girl grandfather, the girl" "Is often on your mind" Kylos face under the mask was twisted up in frustration "I failed the supreme leader he knows her power rivals mine" "Your power is unmatched" replied the spirit "your doubt is why you failed to defeat the girl, I was not the strongest because of my power it was because of my believe in what I was doing was for the greater good of the galaxy" Kylo shook his head "how grandfather, how do I believe tell me how" "The supreme leader will cast you aside if suspects the girl of being your better but she is emotional full loneliness and sorrow both paths to dark side prey on these weaknesses" Kylo looked up and his grandfathers spectre in aw "how ?" "A cunning attack is neither body nor mind my grandson but the heart" "Yes grandfather I understand I will make you proud she will bend or she will break" "FWOSH" was the sound that the sliding doors made aboard the imperial ships, Jano walked in she wore a First Order uniform even though she was just a made it was tight fitting and really showed off her incredible shaped bust, "WHAT !" Kylo roared "I'm sorry, I'm sorry master Ren" she squeaked jumping back dropping the tray of food and drink, she was shaking in terror with one of her hands holding her index finger she did that when she was nervous or scared her blond ponytail and baby face always calmed Kylo who couldn't bring himself to be to harsh with her. "Get rid of the mess" the girl dropped to her knees scraping up broken glass and ceramics "yes sorry Master Ren" Kylo looked back in the direction of his grandfathers helmet the spectre was gone he clenched his fists and rolled shoulders back he felt his anger rising to the surface "No, Aaaaaagh" he turned back seeing Jano beginning to shake again "get up" he said impatiently she rose to her feet "Come here" she walked forward rubbing her left arm head down staring at floor lip quivering Kylo grabbed her chin and brought his face so close to hers there must only have been a sliver of light between them "have I ever hit you" tearing up and shaking she squeaked "No" he liked the way it made him feel scaring or making her nervous, it excited him it felt erotic to have so eager to please him so desperate to keep him happy a little play thing for his distraction "you interrupted me, It's time for my scar to be cleaned you know what to do" Kylo sat in the chair and Jano grabbed the liquid and cream for the scar she was still shaking as she placed them on a tray next to higher chair she sat on to treat the scar more efficiently. She pressed the side of the helmet still shaking the mask made a "KWOF" sound as the mouth piece raised to allow the helmet to come off the red scar ran upwards from the his right cheek seared into his skin and only served to make him more terrifyingly handsome, he placed his hands up on her hips she paused and began to pant heavily "stop it just take your time, not to long though I have work to do" she composed herself but there were still tremors as she applied the stinging liquid he squeezed her hips in pain as the stinging began as he squeezed tight she'd hesitate just a little before applying more, "forget the cream" he said laying his face on her knees. He looked back up at her "take of your jacket and shirt" he said she began to shake and try to avoid his gaze as she did as he until she was wearing only a beast "now your boots" again shaking harder she did as he said avoiding his gaze now only wearing a vest, trousers and underarm beneath Kylie Ren stood up and placed his hand under her chin savouring every second of squirming "im not goin to hurt you I need to sleep to meditate and I don't want to be alone" he pulled her toward his be and both of them lay down on the bed he pulled her close "stop shaking or I'll get angry" he said Jano found it hard biting her lip to stop from shaking. PAST Kylo found himself staring at a Jedi temple it was an ancient temple he couldn't remember how he got here, but he knew it was a Jedi temple and he did not feel anger being there only anxiety he looked around it was quite dark you know that twilight dark were its black with shades of dark blur through the air. "HELLO !" he called out it echoed throughout the temple he walked forward "I know your here Jedi I know what this is, some sort of force vision to invade my mind no one your precious order was destroyed because you don't have the courage to face your enemy man to man" "Such anger" a voice in the darkness replied "who's said that" Kylo called out a Kylie child human shaped figure came out of the shadows "that's not possible" Kylo Ren said in shock powering up his lightsaber "that's has no use here young Ben" "That is not my name old man" he said pointing his cross guard saber at Obi Wan Kenobi "pretending you've forgotten your name doesn't mean the name is not your own" "I'd heard the stories about you, that you spoke in riddles and half truths but even so I didn't expect you to be such cliche old man, my mother spun me all these stories since the cradle when she was there anyway and not off with her precious new republic" "Your mother had many responsibilities but she was still there for you" "She abounded just like Han Solo trying to flood me with childhood memories will only serve to fuel my anger Kenobi" Obi Wan walked deeper into the temple "I've heard a similar rant when I was young man from a confused and corrupted young Anakin Skywalker" Kylo came running behind Obi Wan "How dare you say his name, how dare you insienuate he was sheep to be so easily corrupted" "He was" replied Obi Wan "he was taken apart and put back together by his master, he was lied to by the emperor twisted by guilt and loneliness, the sigh look inward for the power your grandfathers hatred for himself is what ultimately consumed him" Kylo felt his rage bubbling to the surface "your grandfather would not want you to go down his path this was the Jedi temple of corosant your grandfather was apart of our order before he fell into corruption" "My grandfather was tired of the you and your Jedi lies he was bringing piece to the galaxy while you war mongers wanted to hold back progression, he surpassed you all and you all feared his power so you held him back stopping his potential out of fear of losing your power" "There's so much anger in you Ben Solo anger at your mother, at your uncle, at your father anger is perfectly natural but learning to control it is immensely important anger destroyed your grandfather" Ben heard marching behind him he recognised the armour "Clones" said but there was hooded figure in front with glowing yellow eyes, "what's this" said Kylo Ren "its the birth of Darth Vader young Ben Solo" he seen the skirmish as the clones blasted away half trained Jedi some masters remained but they were outmanned and outgunned an nine were as powerful or skilful as his grandfather who wouldn't lower himself to duel any of the oncoming Jedi "TRAITOR" they shouted while others begged "Anakin no don't do this" Kylo Ren only felt pride "You forget Jedi I had a similar task once upon a time, I had destroyed Skywalker temple the supreme leader knew it was necessary to stop Skywalker from restoring the Jedi fascists your totalitarian order has been wiped out twice by me and my grandfather who will see order brought TO THE GALAXY !" "Master Skywalker" he heard from behind him it was a small boy in Jedi robes "you've killed as Kylo Ren, Ben Solo but never have you done something like this" he heard the sudden strike of energy from a powers up lightsaber the Lilac glow revealed his grandfather Anakin Skywalker but he was most certainly looking at Darth Vader "Stop this !" Kylo said anxiously "I cannot" replied "Obi Wan the past has already been written his grandfather moved forward from the shadows grasping his lightsaber he was more like a grey wraith now one slash cut the boy in half and then the children began to scream as he moved through cutting one down after the other, they begged and pleaded but not once did he even pause Kylo felt a tear run down his cheek underneath his helmet not one of the children even drew a lightsaber as they ran from wall to wall tripping and falling over one another until all the screams were silenced and there bloody bodies were strewn across the floor the grey wraith of Darth Vader depowerd his lightsaber walked silently to the door took one emotionless look back with his yellow eyes and disappeared. "Two more ghosts will visit you tonight Ben Solo maybe after you will reconsider your path remember we cannot change the past, we do what we can in the present and the future is not ours to see"
