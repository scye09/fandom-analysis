Jealousy is unnecessary. Entangled now our three hearts are, Desert scavenger, fighter pilot, Imperial child stormtrooper. Stolen childhood, stolen innocence, Together we’ll build something sweet. Our lives are our lives not theirs to own. Rebels have the freedom to choose. Marks and scars don’t make you an outcast. Pilots can have nightmares of fear. Innocence lost can leave you fearful. Love can bind us all in safety. Out in the world I’ll hold your hand, Together in a safe, free land. Chapter 2 : Haiku I thought one was all, Soul mates out with my control, Three caught by love’s call. Chapter 3 : You Can Be You can be cocksure if it makes you Confident. You can be self-sufficient if it makes you Strong. You can be hesitant if it makes you Brave. You can be you, so Long as you both are Mine. Chapter 4 : You Need a Pilot You’re lost scared, confused Out of control, out of safety. Until I find you. Not what I was thinking or Expecting but you. Enthralling, new, possibly Dangerous you. You find me. Adventure waits from here. Planets and galaxies stretch In front of us. Take my hand. Let’s go somewhere else, to the Outer Rim to hidden bases. Together, there, we’re found.
