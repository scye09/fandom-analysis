She wakes with a start, the shirt she's wearing clinging to her skin, cold with sweat. Without a conscious thought in her head, she stumbles out of the bed ( too cold, too big, too empty, wheareareyouwhereareyouwhenIneedyou) and slowly taps into the adjoining room. The baby in the crib is fast asleep. He doesn't seem to share his parents' insomniac tendencies, she thinks with a relieved smile and pulls up the blankets that cover her son. He's fine. "Leia?" She gives a start, then fights down a little shriek. " Han ," she whispers, trying to hide her relief. "When did you get back?" "Just landed," he replies, a little too loud. She throws him a look and glances at Ben. "Why are you up?" he asks, quieter now. She stares down at their son, his tiny hands clenched into fists, and shivers. "I... had a nightmare." Han doesn't reply, just wraps his arms around her. She immediately feels a little better. "Something had hapened to Ben," she murmurs. "Luke was gone, and... you'd left, too." "You think we'd let that happen?" He presses a kiss to her forehead and smiles. "You're not getting rid of me, princess. Come on, we'll wake him."
