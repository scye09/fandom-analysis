"Just breathe - he probably isn't lost." "Okay breathe...I'm probably not lost." "If Ren stuck to the plan, he'll arrive at the checkout shortly, with or without Millicent's cushion." "What did Hux say the plan was again?" "No...if he stuck to the plan, he would have been here half an hour ago." "Those are...a lot of sofas." "Theoretically, I should just stay here. Ren will eventually finish whatever he's doing and follow signs for the exit." "At least this is a good place to wait for Hux. The next section could be nothing but tiny barstools." "Or...he could be lost." "But what if Hux is lost?" "I'm...going to have to go back in there aren't I?" "If I were Hux, where would I be?" "Ren tends to fixate on readily apparent options without considering alternatives..." "Definitely this way - Hux would never weave through aisles just to hunch through that tiny door." "...large doorways, bright colors, bold shapes..." "Hey! I wonder what that weird orange thing is." "This...this section is nothing but large doorways, and bold, brightly colored shapes...same as the last, and the one before that." "Wait...have I been here before?" "He'll get overwhelmed!" "Breathe...I said breathe!" "How long before he gets frustrated and causes a disturbance I wonder?" "This...is...(lightsaber ignites) NOT WHERE I WANT TO BE RIGHT NOW!" "Aaand cue fleeing customers. Wonderful. At least I have a general sense of where to go now." "YEAH YOU'D BETTER RUN!" "And...there! Don't act relived don't act relieved don't act relieved don't act relieved don't act relieved..." "It's Hux! And he found Millicent's cushion!" "Lucky I found the cushion - should smack that dopey grin off his face quite nicely."
