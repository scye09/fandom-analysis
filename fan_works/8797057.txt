Rey moved with the quick, decisive motion of a woman that was accustomed to having to scrape by. She didn't go out of her way to avoid attention, but she also didn't draw eyes unless it was necessary. She also had a distressing tendency to take as much food as she could get away with in the refectory, and Leia knew she was stockpiling those foods that came sealed or would keep for a long time. When Leia observed the woman, she saw someone who had struggled to survive, a being that was used to being on the bottom of the social order but capable of defending what she did have. It made the elder woman struggle to find a way to curb the instinctive reactions, as Leia did respect them, even admire them, while wanting Rey to relax into her new role. She was safe here, or at least as safe as any member of the Resistance could be. Leia didn't want to dull any of Rey's survival skills, only help her see that this was a haven. Only, she'd never been able to guide Han away from his habits, so why did she think she could with Rey?
