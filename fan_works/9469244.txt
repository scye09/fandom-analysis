CHAPTER ONE It was a chance. The first chance in a long time. There had never been a solid link before, but the work of missing geologist Luke Skywalker could finally prove Order First’s involvement in the mass human rights violations in the region, perhaps even warrant further investigation into their other operations, like those in Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel/Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Nigeria, and the Sudan. And, if Order First could be convicted, then surely there was a way for Interpol to prove that Snoke Empire headquarters knew about, and perhaps even planned for the massacres in the Orientale Province of the Eastern DRC. Someone however, had tipped Order First off. The approach of the AW101 Merlin helicopter is unmistakable, as is the heavy machine gun fire that blows the rental 152 Cessna wide open on the tarmac. Choices, thus, become limited. Under-cover Interpol agent Poe Dameron hides behind a crate with a ten-year old Central African ex-child soldier called "BB" with all viable escape routes cut-off, except one warehouse window that is too impossibly small for Dameron himself to fit through. Dameron hoists a hesitant BB up to the window ledge, shoving a flash drive into the ten-year-old's bright orange shorts' pocket. "Take it," Poe whispers harshly in the child's native Lendu, when the child hints to shake his head, eyes wide. Not frightened, but unwilling. "It's safer with you than it is with me. They'll keep me alive longer, if they don't know where it is. Take it, and hide. I'll come back for you. It'll all be alright." BB is a good little soldier. In the end he does what he's told. With one little backwards glance as he lands on the pavement of the airstrip outside, the diminutive-but-deadly ex-child soldier is gone into the night. Used to disappearing into the surrounding jungle bush, the child has better chance of escape than most grown men. And no one is looking for BB. Their cover is blown and Capt. Dameron knows that no one is coming to rescue him. The tracking devices? Gone. The wires? Ren has them. Kyle O. Ren also has Lorr, the rather harmless old humanitarian who'd first tipped Interpol to Order First's dealings, and had fallen into procession of Luke Skywalker’s work. "So you've changed your name to Kyle?" the old man practically sneers. "That doesn't change where you come from. I knew you before you called yourself 'Kyle'." Amusement is not apparent on the figure's face. No emotions are. He wears a carved wooden African mask, instead of a baklava, instead of camouflage bush paint. The mask makes him seem removed from his humanity, like some dark animal spirit, or jungle monster. The white-baklavaed thugs holding the brave white-haired fool pinned down to floor seem shocked that anybody could have the audacity to speak to the figure in the mask that way. "What did you do with the map?" the tall dark figure overshadowing Lorr drolls, as if the shadow were a person acting patient with a small child. "I know you stole it. Order First wants it back." "I don't care what you call yourself now---but you don't have their excuses." The old fool attempts to gesture at the mercenary thugs that hold his head with force to the concrete floor. "They grew up in this mess, but you didn't. You don't have their excuses. You can't deny the truth. You can't deny your family!" "You're so right," the dark shadow of a man speaks, as if amused. Immediately there upon, he put a bullet through the old man’s head. Dameron doesn’t think. He acts. He rushes Kyle Ren, and raises the Glock 17 he usually keeps holstered under his jacket. Before he can get a proper shot off, though, two of the Order First mercs punch him in the side, and Poe feels himself being dragged to kneel before their boss in the mask. His knees are in the blood of Lorr Tekka, and he doesn’t know the appropriate response to the situation. Dameron, of course, finds himself laughing. “You talk first? Or I talk first?” He stares up at the totem mask. “Kind of hard to...understand you..." "Search him," Ren orders. "...with that mask...thing," Dameron finishes. “So the old man gave it to you? Don't worry...you’ll talk,” the masked figure assures him.Then Mr. Kyle O. Ren barks to the mercenaries wearing the white baklavas and white t-shirts, “Get him on board!” Dameron resists, but is struck down several times until his ears whistle, and his legs become jelly. Then, he is being dragged out the warehouse into the burning night. The Order First mercenary soldiers have the local villagers lined up by the side of the river. A couple of brave villagers resist, and shoot at the Order First mercs with the couple of AK-47s they have, taking down one or two Order First men, to the doom of their village, but are eventually overwhelmed by the superior firepower of the Order First men, who have a crew of twenty-four with M4s, and an armed assault helicopter for back-up. An anonymous Order First merc stares openly at Dameron being led past his burning C-152 stunt-bush plane, to the awaiting Merlin helicopter. The merc’s white baklava is stained with human blood, with the splay of a red hand print. From the armored chopper a tall leggy blonde woman emerges in an immaculate grey shift dress, ducking the propellers and moving expertly in quicksilver stilettos, brandishing a sat. phone. To the masked totem man the blonde executive-type woman inquires, “So what do you want us to do with the villagers, Mr. Ren?” “Kill them,” Mr. Ren tells her flatly. “Kill them all. But use machetes. Make it look like the locals did it.” The woman nods neatly, and instructs the Order First soldiers in their white baklavas to kill the locals, but to do it with machetes. Her words are crisp and well-formed, and in the feminine accent of the speaker, seem doubly monstrous. It’s too late for any of those working for Order First to quit, but in the following madness pursuant blood bath, no one quite notices how one merc stands aside, staring at the red blood all around him, and the village by the river, on fire in the jungle in the night. “Do we bury them, Mr. Ren?” the blonde asks pertly, after every man, woman, and child in the village lies lifeless. In disgust, the woman wipes off a bit of blood that has gotten onto her stilettos on a patch of wet grass near the riverbank, a ways away from the massacre. “Leave them.” And then Mr. Ren departs in the helicopter with the surely doomed Dameron, who knows he is going to be tortured, and then killed. Poe has no hope for himself. What hope he has left is invested into the escape of his little accidental side-kick. He is hoping that somehow BB will be able to get the flash to Interpol Secretary-General Leia Organa in time to use the information contained on the drive. It’s too late for him. Surely, BB will figure out a way. The kid was a survivor. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ For the merc with the blood-stained handprint on his mask, the final inhumanity is in not digging a grave. There’s blood on his hands, and he can’t even bury the night with their forms, and their screams. The merc, once he’s back on a boat, heading back down river, finds he can’t breathe. He tears off his mask in a hot sweaty panic. The blonde Executive from headquarters eyes him in reprehension. “Who said you could take off your mask? Fool. Put it back on.” “Sorry, ma’am,” the merc pulls the iron-tanged fabric back over his brow, and all the stars glittering peacefully in the wide African sky cannot silence the screams of the villagers that he will hear in his dreams for the rest of his life. “What is your employee number with us?” the blonde raises on perfectly sculpted eyebrow at him. Obliquely obedient the merc obliges her with the information: “FN-2187.” “Well, FN-287, I’m going to recommend you to undergo a review when we get back, is that understood, soldier? “Yes, ma’am,” the merc grates in response keenly, as they head back down river to the mining camp Order First is operating under. He knows now there's no quitting for the Order First employee. Employee FN-2187 is also aware that there's no way he can get out on foot, and he won't make it far by river. Borders are no good. The only way out of this god-forsaken country is by air. That's when he remembers the Interpol undercover they've got, probably back at camp. Their bosses wanted him alive for some reason. That guy, he had a pilot's license. "That guy, is probably my last ticket out of this hell-hole," employee FN-2187 realizes, and so he comes up with a plan.
