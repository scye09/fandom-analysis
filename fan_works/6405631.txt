Excerpt from ch2 of Home Out in the Wind: Finn had a disconcerting habit of staring at Poe instead of himself when shaving, Poe discovered that morning as they stood together at the counter with the pair of sinks and big mirror. Only after he’d gone through the whole routine of styling his hair did he finally speak up. “Is your mirror broken, or something?” he asked. Finn laughed. “No,” he said, “I’m used to shaving without a good one.” He gestured with the razor. “You spend forever on your hair. I thought you just woke up looking like that!” Poe gave him a look of genuine surprise. “Forever,” he said. “It takes me three to five minutes depending on how humid it is and when I last washed it.” More like five to seven, but nobody had to know that. He could shave pretty fast, and usually made up enough time that he had managed not to acquire more than the usual reputation of taking forever in the fresher. Finn smoothed his hand over his close-cropped head. “Three to five minutes,” he said, and rinsed the razor off. “And when you’re done it looks like you didn’t do anything to it.” Poe laughed. “Believe me,” he said, “if I didn’t do this, it’d look very different.” LJ | TUMBLR
