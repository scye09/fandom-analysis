He’s been lying in the dark for a few hours now. The digital display of his clock says that it’s 4:02 a.m. already. He turns around, closing his eyes again. Sometimes he curses his bad sleeping habbits. Maybe he should just get up and start working but he knew he’d be the only one in the department and he was scared to be alone in the dark. In his room are plenty of farylights to keep him calm. He wishes Matt was here to soothe him but he was far away on annother planet and there was no way he’d be back anytime soon. Techie has to face his fears alone and he knows it is so childish to rely on Matt like that. He feels so stupid and weak because he misses this man so much. Matt has probably no idea how Techie feels and he would never tell him. Matt deserved better than a scrawny, pale man with no self esteem.
