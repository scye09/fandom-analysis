“You’re being absolutely ridiculous!” To be honest, neither Rey nor Poe knew what they were fighting about. They didn’t even care anymore. Poe just really wanted to win this argument. Rey, on the other hand, was beyond done with it. She looked at him, the fire in his eyes were clear to see. He really wanted to win the stupid argument. Apparently in Poe’s mind, to win an argument you have to stand on a goddamn chair. “Get down, you idiot,” Rey muttered looking up at him. “No.” “Get down!” Rey shouted now, kicking one of the legs of the chair. What was meant to happen was Poe falling on his ass, like he usually did. A bit of quick humour for Rey. But it didn’t. Poe looked up at Rey, his hands on his hips, now smirking at Rey, who looked like she was just about to erupt. “You screwed the chair,” Rey started, “to the floor?” “Seeing as how many times you’ve kicked me off the damn chair, it only seemed rational to do so!” Poe shouted back gesturing to the floor where he had been on “Well maybe, if you weren’t so senseless, you wouldn’t be on your ass in the first place!” Rey said as she starting waving her arms above her head. “Guys. There’s this amazing things called pizza, the chef gave me a whole bo-“ “Not now!” Poe and Rey yelled in unison to a now startled Finn, who had burst into the room with a box of pizza, which he thought to be the best invention in the world. The next day, Rey unscrewed the chair from the floor. Notes: Comment, leave kudos, do anything you want! Hope you like it.
