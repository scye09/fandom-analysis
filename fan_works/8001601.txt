Droids in Love “Beep,” said R2. “Bleep-bloop,” BB-8 agreed. It had been love at first non-mission-based interaction, and they spoke a language all their own. They had to, because if they spoke in any of the regular android languages, C-3PO would interrupt and ruin the moment. But now that they’d created a modified method of communication that only they could understand, it was pure bliss. Together, BB-8 and R2-D2 put the world to rights, agreeing on most things, and sharing their past experiences. With all the major drama of war held off for a while, they had plenty of time to get to know each other. BB, it turned out, like Jazz music, while R2 liked the Blues. Both enjoyed tap dancing, and Doctor Who. Occasionally, they’d catch Leia looking at them, with a wistful expression. They understood. It was nice to not be alone.
