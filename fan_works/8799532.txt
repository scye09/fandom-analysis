Day 9 - Mittens and Scarves Hux was bored of driving in the snow, it was an absolute pain in the ass. The only reason he did it without too much complaint, was sat next to him in a bright red jumper and pyjama bottoms, window open despite the freezing temperature, long hair billowing in the wind.

His scarf is uncoiling from his neck and getting caught in his jacket. If only Ben didn’t need to have the window open. And then the icing on top of the proverbial cake happens. The radio betrays him, and the first chords of Ironic play out. Ben’s gasp is pure joy, and the man is singing along almost immediately. Hux looks warily as Ben unclips his seatbelt and leans out the window, fucking singing to this stupid song and he can’t help it and suddenly he’s singing too.
