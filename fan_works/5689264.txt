Finn reached out, pulling Poe into his arms just before the pilot burst into tears. He said nothing, he didn’t need to. He just hummed, rubbing his back in slow circles before guiding him towards the bed, sitting him down before settling down beside him, keeping his arms around him. “It…my head hurts and then I just…” Poe stopped, shaking his head as he pressed the heels of his hands against his temples. He chewed on his bottom lip, limbs shaking before he could force himself to speak again. “I just…see myself back there…” “I’m sorry.” “This is stupid. Other people have suffered worse… I don’t have any right to be like this,” he muttered. “That’s not true,” Finn pressed, shaking his head. “Your pain is your pain. It’s not any less or more than anyone else’s.” “I need to get over this…” “You need to deal with it at your own pace.” Poe lowered his hands, looking over at Finn. He offered him a sad smile, shaking his head. “When did you get so good at this?” he asked. “When you helped me become human again.”
