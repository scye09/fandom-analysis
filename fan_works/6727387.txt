He was to die for the cause. They all were, when the time came. The thought hit him suddenly, as he carried out routine orders that had become mind numbing in their familiarity already. Death’s presence was a constant, with a different person becoming only a memory day after day, but this was the first time he considered that presence in regards to his own fate. Would someone notice? Would someone mourn him? He doubted it. Who mourned all the others that died every day? Even he couldn’t claim to have properly mourned for all the ones that didn’t make it from day to day, though there was always a tinge of sadness in his chest he tried to keep quiet about when another dead was mentioned. There was little time to mourn when orders were to be carried out. He couldn’t devote much time to contemplation for the same reason he couldn’t mourn them, there was always work to be done, but the thought stuck with him. The idea that they all would die and everyone would probably want someone to mourn them, even briefly, crept into his mind whenever he had a moment to think. If he wanted someone to mourn him, one day, maybe he ought to do what he could right now for those that died. When he heard mention of another death, he tried his best to remember any interaction he had with the deceased. Anything positive would do, maybe a time when they had held the door open for him or something, and he would focus on that moment. He would try to miss the person he would never get to interact with again. They deserved to be remembered. They deserved to be mourned. Maybe his mourning was silly. Perhaps no one else would be comforted by knowing there was someone that mourned every person he could. FN-2187 would never know. All he knew was it made him feel better, in a sad kind of way, and that made it matter.
