Caleb (DeeDee can’t tell Caleb and Hux apart, because her facial recognition software isn’t sophisticated enough) The droid seemed to look at him with a blank faceplate, and extended a metallic hand, the long fingers stretching over his own. He almost jumped at the coolness of the touch. “Don’t cry. He doesn’t like it when you cry.” Her voice was barely more comforting than her appearance, yet he sensed… something behind the droid’s words. “It’s fine, DeeDee,” Caleb reassured her, wiping his eyes with his other hand. “Nobody’s going to see. It’ll be our secret.” “Secret?” The droid tilted her head, thoughtful. “Yes. Like the holovids you showed me just now, the ones Mother made just for me.” DeeDee considered this for a moment before giving a gesture that he hoped indicated acceptance, even if he did doubt Brendol had little interest in his emotions. “Would you like to play a game?” she asked suddenly, seemingly eager to change the subject. “Mmm…like sabacc?” “I am not familiar with that game.” “Would you like to pick the game, DeeDee?” “You used to enjoy strategy games,” she said, her head turning as she scanned the room, expression as blank as always. “I require more information about the layout of the Finalizer to locate them.” “That’s okay, I’m a little tired anyway. We’ll play another time. I could teach you how to play sabacc.” “I would like that.” DeeDee began to release the grip on his hand, but paused at the sound of a particularly nasty cough. “Are you unwell?” Something about her tone was different this time. “It’s just a cold. A good night’s sleep ought to help.”
