It was an unspoken rule amongst the crew; you did not mess with the General's child. Not unless you were suicidal, and even then it wasn't worth the risk. When he'd come back one day holding a child with dark hair and wide brown eyes, a fierce look challenging any of his subordinates to protest against allowing it onboard, Ren tense at his side with a hand over his lightsaber hilt, the rule established itself. It was often kept away from everyone else, staying with Ren as the force bloomed inside of it. He'd vowed to himself to never let them suffer as he had, never let anyone take them away. He would protect them and love them with all his being, show them the care force users were so widely denied when they needed it most. Anyone and anything who dare threatened them would meet his blade, find themselves unable to breathe as the force tightened around their throats. As soon as it learned to talk, it would tell Hux everything. Every detail of their day was encouraged and listened to, offered feedback and suggestions. Hux gave them all the attention and support they could ask for, gave the affection he'd been denied as a boy. The General was protective, would never let anyone harm his child under his watch. If they were upset they'd go to him, recieve comfort and reassurance, gentleness reserved for only them, and then he'd rip to shreds the poor soul that made them cry.
