Finn, having lived in temperature controlled spaceships his entire life, has a set temperature he likes to have his room set to. Stray from this tempertaure at your own peril. If you mess with his thermostat, he will find you. Rey, on the other hand, cannot stand cold temperatures. Her room is always amongst the warmest on the resistance base, hot as an oven and just as dry. She'll also defend the temperature as fiercely as Finn - her friends have learned to fear any mission that takes place on a colder planet, due to the complaining that Rey will do on their way back. And for the fear that she'll use one of them as her own personal space heater and put her ice-block hands inside their shirts in an attempt to warm them up. Poe, on the other hand, doesn't care what temperature it is - Yavin 4 had a reasonably consistent temperature that is simialr to Finn's one true temperature, but the rest of his squad are convinced he's half cat, so he is insanely comfortable in Rey's room. He just melts into whatever piece of furniture he's sitting on, leaving Rey disgusted that he's incapable of operating. "It's not that hot!" "Uurghghhhmmmm" he says as he slides down the chair he's sitting on, face of comfortable relaxation.
