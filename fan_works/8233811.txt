“Hux! You didn’t even try to save me!” “Kylo, I did everything I could, the planet was collapsing!” “You watched me die!” Hux sighed. Dating Kylo Ren was already a challenge, now trying to continue said relationship while Kylo was dead was nearly disastrous. It’d be one thing if Kylo was dead, but he wasn’t just dead, he followed Hux around all day complaining and- well. Not too much has changed since he died, Hux guessed. He still stomped around The Finalizer like he was in control. He still trained with Snoke, although his training focused on all that he could do with his new capabilities. He still managed to be a pain in Hux’s ass. And they continued on to have sex, the sex was even better now that Kylo was dead to be quite honest. There wasn’t that much to clean up. “Oh my god! You basically killed me, and now you think it’s better that I’m dead!” “Stay out of my head Ren! I merely suggested that it’s been more efficient since your death. And I didn’t kill you!” Hux and Kylo continued arguing, and even though Hux missed the warmth of Kylo’s body, and even though their relationship could never be the same, he was happy that Kylo was in his life one way or another. Even if the bastard still broke his equipment. Notes: Hahah, you can't convince me otherwise, that Kylo wouldn't still break things even after death!
