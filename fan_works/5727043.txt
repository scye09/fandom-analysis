1 "Hux, what are you doing?" Kylo whispered, looking around to make sure that the teacher wasn't looking. "I'm making a paper airplane!" Hux said excitedly, but he said it a little too loud. "Hux! Give me whatever you're playing with!" the teacher said out loud, and Hux got up from his desk. "Please don't throw it away, I worked hard on it!" Hux pleaded, but the teacher shook her head. "I'm sorry, these things are not allowed in my classroom." she explained as Hux handed it over. Throwing it in the trash, the teacher soon went back to typing on her computer. That's when Hux got the perfect idea.
