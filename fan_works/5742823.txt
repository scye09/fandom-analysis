“Millennium Falcon, you are clear to land. Rogue Squadron, please take two passes before attempting to land,” Aura said into her microphone. A blast of roaring reply came into the mic. With a smirk on her lips she pulled the headset away from her ear and spun around in her chair, “General Organa?” The old war hero and legend turned towards her dark circles beneath her eyes, “They’re back, ma’am.” Several whoops of joy rung out and papers flew down as the control room filled with celebration. Aura stood up from her chair and wiped her forehead. A hand clapped down on her shoulder and she turned around to find Leia Organa smiling at her. Confused and shocked at the sudden tap she stared at the woman with wide, green eyes. The general gave a half-smile then walked away, as Aura was pulled into a hug by one of the other analysts. Warily she watched her superior retreat from the room. “Hey, Aura!” a voice called to her from behind. Turning around, she was greeted by strong arms, blonde hair and a happy-go-lucky smile. Warm lips crashed into hers and she let out a gasp as she pushed the young man away. “Kyle!” she said looking around at the officers and other servicemen around them. Warm hands slipped around her waist and she looked up at him. “They’re busy,” he said, pulling her from the room. Glancing behind her, she saw that the room was indeed engaged in more celebratory affairs. Without a word she closed the door behind her as they snuck out. ***************************************************************************** Bending down she pulled her leggings on one leg at a time as the man in her bed watched her with eyes as blue as the Manaan seas. Kyle sat up on his elbows and quirked an eyebrow, “They don’t even know we’re gone. Come back to bed,” he murmured. Aura laughed, “Why Lieutenant Mas, how unprofessional of you,” pulling on her shirt, and leaving it completely unbuttoned, she sauntered over to him, her hips swaying back and forth provocatively. She sat down next to him, and pressed her lips against his, as his fingers followed the center line of her body, grazing over her skin, down between her alabaster breasts before coming to rest on her waist. The two of them broke apart as Kyle looked up at her. “I love you,” he said. Aura froze. Her eyes stared down at him in shock. “Um…” she looked away. Kyle sat up. “Ummmm?” he asked raising an eyebrow. She looked back at him sheepishly, unsure of what to say. “I---.” She cut herself off and stood up, ready to flee. Her hands rose up and started buttoning up her shirt, in a frenzy. A warm, slightly rough hand caught her wrist. She stopped. She let her head tilt back, so she could look up at the ceiling. Closing her eyes she turned around, “Kyle, I’m sorry, I just… I don’t know yet.” Her eyes opened and she stared up at him. “Okay,” he said. She leaned back in surprise, and pressed her palms against his naked chest, muscles rippling beneath his skin. “Okay?” she asked, raising an eyebrow. He nodded and looked over her head like he was peering into the future, “Okay,” he shrugged, “You’re not there yet.” He looked back at her face and wrapped his arms around her, “I can wait. I’m a very patient man, lieutenant.” He pressed his forehead against hers and she closed her eyes. An excited whoop came from the hall outside their door. Aura looked over her shoulder, then back up at Kyle. Clearing her throat she pushed herself away from them, “I need to get back,” she said. Picking up her boots she pulled one on, as she balanced on the other foot, “I’ll see you later?” “Sure.” She looked back at her fellow officer and blushed as she finished getting dressed. She backed away and stopped by the door, “Maybe you should,” she said looking back at him with a playful smirk, “Find some clothes, before Skal walks in?” **************************************************************************** Aura sat down at her desk with a sigh. Come on! A guy says he loves you and all you can come up with is “Um?” A pile of paperwork fell on her desk as the control room sergeant walked by. The old man looked down at her with a scowl, knowing full well where she had been, but did not say anything. Instead he just continued his rounds. Understanding that this was a one-time only chance to make up for her disappearance she started working through the pile. Even though they were only a few hours into celebrating their victory over Star Killer base and the First Order, someone still had to make sure the Resistance’s flight command system was watched over. With grim determination Aura took on that responsibility. “Hey, where were you?” Skal, Aura’s roommate, who also worked two desks down, asked. She was a little older than Aura, with blonde hair she kept cropped short. She was also the only other person in the room besides the desk sergeant and Aura. The lieutenant glanced at her, and shook her head, Don’t ask. Aura turned back to her computer screen and began to document the flight logs of Rogue squadron. Footsteps sounded behind her and she bit back on a groan as Skal sat down next to her. “So,” the blonde began, “I couldn’t help but notice that Lieutenant Mas went missing around the same time you did.” Aura shrugged, “You act like you know something.” Skal pouted and crossed her arms, “Oh, come on, girl! I need some details!” “We went down on each other so hard we broke the bed,” Aura said, as she typed Rogue II’s flight log into the computer, “Is that what you’re looking for?” she asked without losing her focus. The other analyst pushed away from the table, “You’re no fun, you know that?” “That’s not what Kyle said,” Aura yelled in retort. “Ahem.” The young woman spun around in her seat, then jumped, “General!” she exclaimed, as she saluted her superior. Leia Organa waved her off, “At ease,” she said. She looked at the computer screen behind Aura, “Why aren’t you at the celebration?” she asked. “I---,” the lieutenant began before the sergeant walked over. “Lieutenant Keys is documenting the flight logs and deaths of out fighter squadrons, ma’am.” General Organa frowned, “Don’t you think that can wait until tomorrow?” “But, General,” the old man began. The Resistance leader held her hand out to him and cut him off. She turned to Aura and Skal, “Go on, both of you. It’s been a long day.” Aura hesitated, but Skal nodded her head to the door as thought to say, “Get out before she changes her mind!” With a nod to the General she followed behind the other girl and they both left the room. Aura glanced behind her, to find the woman staring at her. It was like General Organa was looking at a long lost child or a loved one. A chill settled over Aura as she walked out the door. **************************************************************************** “I can’t believe the old woman let us go,” Skal hissed as they walked down the corridor. Aura frowned, “She’s not that old.” She shook her head and stopped unable to shake the feeling that there was more to the General than what met the eye. Skal stopped in front of her and waved a hand in her face, “Hey, what’s wrong?” “Nothing,” Aura said pushing past the girl. “Girl, you’ve been acting like you’ve got a bantha stick shoved up your ass, ever since you came back from your little party with Kyle.” “I’m fine, Skal. It’s just---,” she turned and looked at the other girl. “What?” Aura shook her head, and looked back down the hallway. Silently she moved her hand behind her back. “I think I left my ring on my desk.” She started back down the corridor without the other woman. “Oh,” Skal said looking back in the opposite direction, “Do you want me to come with you?” she called, the hope that Aura would refuse, evident in her voice. “It’s fine. I’ll see you later!” the girl called disappearing around the corner. Once she was out of sight she leaned against the wall and sighed as she looked down at her hand a silver ring glistening on her right ring finger. Skal’s footsteps disappeared and Aura peeked out from around the corner. Tilting her head to the side she stretched up towards the ceiling and walked slowly back down the way she had come. Silently she fidgeted with the ring on her finger. Brown eyes, glimmering in starlight, stared down at her, “Don’t lose this. It’s all I have to give right now, but maybe---.” Aura froze and blinked her eyes as pain shot through her head. Her right hand pressed against the wall as she steadied herself. Just as the pain disappeared, and she took a step forward, it came roaring back with a vengeance. “Hah-augh ---, “ she gasped as she bent over pressing a hand to her forehead. “Not again.” “Ben, stop, this isn’t you---.” A voice screamed tearing through her mind and soul. “Aura? Aura can you hear me?” Dim lights flickered and a hand caught her by the elbow as she stumbled. She looked up, “Kyle?” Grey eyes stared down at her, “Shhhhh, here sit down.” Aura did as she was told, and blinked her eyes as a wave of nausea, dizziness, and blurry vision washed over her. She swallowed and grimaced as the pain began to subside, “General?” The woman came back with a cup of water, “I think you can afford to call me Leia, lieutenant.” Aura took a sip of water and closed her eyes with a sigh. Slowly she tried to stand, but the other woman pushed her down, “You’re not going anywhere for a while.” “I saw---,”Aura shook her head. Leia crouched down and looked up at her in concern, “What did you see?” The young woman stared down at her, “I don’t know.” She looked down at her hand, and at the ring on her finger. Leia stared down at the ring and frowned. When she noticed Aura’s gaze she cleared her throat and looked back up at her face. “You’re exhausted. It’s been a long day for all of us.” The general stood up, “Which way to your quarters?” Aura pointed down the hall in front of them, “Next to the cafeteria.” “All right then, let’s get you to bed.” Leia bent down and helped the girl to her feet. Slowly they made their way down the hall. Aura tried to stand on her own but stumbled, and grabbed onto the wall as her legs gave out. “Watch out there,” General Organa said pulling her back up. “Here hold on to my arm.” Weak, yet grateful, Aura did as she was told. The closer they got to her quarters, the louder the sounds of the celebrations going on in the cafeteria got. With a sigh of relief, they finally made it to Aura’s room. “I think I can handle it from here,” she said. “Are you sure?” Leia asked. Aura nodded her head and started inside. Then she stopped, “General?” she glanced over her shoulder, leaning against the doorway. “Hmmm?” the war hero asked turning back around. “I heard about General Solo. I’m sorry.” Leia sighed and looked down, “Me too, lieutenant, me too.” With that she turned on her heel and made her way silently down the corridor, the lieutenant watching until she disappeared. ************************************************************** In an Unknown System Kylo Ren knelt before a dark figure, sitting on a throne above him. “Your failure has proven that you are still in need of training.” The man looked up, his face covered in bandages. Long dark hair framed his face, “By the grace of your training, I will not make such a mistake again, my master.” Supreme Leader Snoke leaned forward, his marred and disfigured face glowing in the star light surrounding them, “See that you do not, Lord Ren. My mercy is not infinite. You will not receive a third chance.” ****************************************************************************** Skal rolled over in the top bunk and groaned at the light, “It’s too bright, turn it off!” “We have to get up at some point,” Aura said as she pulled her red curls back from her face. Pulling a pillow over her head, Skal mumbled, “Where were you last night? You just disappeared.” Straightening her collar, Aura looked down “I had a headache so I came back to the room early.” With a huff, the other girl turned away, “Lightweight.” Rolling her eyes, Aura turned off the lights and left the room, “Don’t sleep too late!” she yelled at the top of her voice. The sound of a pillow hitting the door as she closed it made her chuckle. “You’re up early,” a voice said behind her. She glanced over her shoulder, “Kyle.” The man nodded to the cafeteria, “Hungry?” he asked. Aura shook her head, “I’ve got a pile of log work to go through---,” she started down the hall quickly. Kyle called after her “Aura…” She waved him off, “I’ll see you at lunch, okay?” The flight lieutenant sighed, “You can’t avoid me forever.” ****************************************************************************** “Good morning, Lieutenant,” General Organa called to her as she sat down. Aura fidgeted under the gaze of her fellow officers. “General,” she said with a nod, as she hunched down in her seat. The woman walked over to her desk, “Walk with me?” Aura looked up at the ceiling and bit back a sigh, “Yes, ma’am.” Pushing her chair back she stood up and followed the general out of the control room, avoiding the desk sergeant’s glare. As they walked down the hall Aura cleared her throat, “Is there something you needed ma’am?” “Where are you from, lieutenant?” “Coruscant.” Leia Organa stopped and looked at her, “Any family there, what with the attack---.” “My parents died when I was young, everyone else I knew---ahem, they didn’t make it.” “I’m sorry to hear that.” They came to a stop in front of a door, opened by the general’s key card. Leia motioned for the girl to follow her, “Make yourself at home,” she said as she closed the door behind them. The room was small with a medium size window overlooking the forest surrounding them. It was plain and simple, like most military dwellings, with a bed, desk, and two chairs as its only furniture. “How’s your head?” she asked. “Much better. Thank you for helping me last night.” Leia gave a half-smile, “Your welcome… Does that happen often?” Aura looked away, “Sometimes.” “You were talking to someone when I found you. A… Ben?” “Sometimes I have… visions,” she grit her teeth together, “I’m not compromised.” “No one said you were,” Leia said holding her palm out to the girl, “I just wanted to make sure you were alright.” Quietly Aura sat down in one of the chairs as Leia went to the window, a data pad in hand. She slipped on a pair of glasses and peered down at the data pad. “Our records show you enlisted two years ago.” “I figured my best chance was with the Resistance.” Leia nodded her head, “Most of our people join up for similar reasons, but this says you climbed the ranks exceptionally quickly until your current rank.” She turned around and sat in one of the chairs, “That was one year ago. Since then you’ve stayed on as an analyst, despite clear and top marks in combat training, flight, and leadership. What I find curious is that you stopped excelling and ceased to gain promotions.” She leaned forward and glanced at the girl, “Do these visions have anything to do with that?” The girl looked away, and nodded, “About a year ago, they started,” she looked back up, “I’m not crazy.” “I don’t think you are either. We all have our demons.” She looked down at the data pad and began to write notes on it. Aura looked around uncomfortably beginning to fidget, “I like my position,” Aura said rubbing her palms up and down the tops of her thighs. “Well, I don’t,” the general said, looking over the rims of her glasses, “I’m moving you to my detail.” Aura cocked her head, “W-why?” She instantly wanted to retract that question when she met the general’s stern gaze and hunched back in her seat. “Someone of your talents is wasted on logging the amount of fuel used on each flight, Aura. You will report to my council meeting this afternoon,” she said dismissing the girl. Aura stood up silently and went to the door, “Oh, and consider this a promotion to the rank of Captain,” Leia called. Aura looked back at her in shock but the woman waved her off, “I’ll see you in two hours Captain Keys.” **************************************************************************** Aura stood by the door to the meeting room waiting for the rest of the General’s detail to show up. “Captain Keys?” a voice asked behind her. She turned around and tried not to show just how shocked she was “A-admiral Ackbar,” she said raising her hand in salute. “At ease,” he said. He walked past her as General Organa walked behind him. She nodded for Aura to follow her inside with her chin. They entered the room together and took a seat around a large table. “This is a debriefing of rogue squadron and the new crew of the Millennium Falcon. Take notes, but don’t be afraid to ask questions. I want your insight.” Aura nodded, “Yes, ma’am.” Quickly she pulled up a notepad on the tabletop.” The door opened and a young man with dark hair walked in. His was a face Aura was all too familiar with. The best pilot in the Resistance. He saluted before taking his seat. “Thank you for joining us, Dameron,” Ackbar said. The young pilot gave a nod and sat straight in his chair. General Organa started the questioning, “Please walk us through the event of the attack on Star Killer Base…” ***************************************************************************** They interviewed pilot after pilot, the Wookie Chewbacca, and even the droid BB-8, before they reached their last subject. Everyone seemed interested to hear from this one, as they all began to whisper as she entered the room. Aura watched silently as a girl, a few years younger than herself entered the room. She had never seen her before, but her brown hair, and stark eyes seemed so familiar. But why? Aura just couldn’t put a finger on it. Another captain cleared his throat as the young woman took a seat in front of them, “Please state your name for the record.” The girl spoke softly, clearly unused to having so much attention thrust upon her, “Rey.” “Last name?” the captain pressed. Rey looked down at her hands that were balled up into fists in her lap, “I don’t have one.” The room was silent. Then, General Organa leaned forward, “Do you know why we have asked you here, Rey?” “You want to know what happened.” “Can you tell us?” someone asked. Rey spoke quietly, “I woke up in an interrogation cell. I didn’t know where I was or what had happened to me. Then he spoke to me.” “Who?” Admiral Ackbar asked. “Kylo Ren,” Rey said looking every single person in the eye around the room. Her gaze fell on Aura who instantly looked away. “He wanted to know about the map to Luke Skywalker.” “Did you give it to him?” Leia asked. “No.” “Then what happened?” “He left, and I escaped from the room. I hid for a while, even stole a blaster off a storm trooper. Then Han, Finn, and Chewbacca found me.” Rey pushed back a wisp of hair that flitted across her forehead, “We tried to escape, but Han thought we needed to stay, and help the resistance. So, we split up.” She explained the plan: plant charges in the oscillator chamber to give rogue squadron a way inside. “But Han…” she looked up at the ceiling, “He was talking with Kylo Ren when we got there. Han said that he was his son. He tried to talk him into turning against the Resistance, but Ren turned on him. He killed Han Solo.” Tears of pain ran down the girls face. All eyes turned to the general, who simply leveled her gaze on the girl. “What about your friend, Finn? Our records indicate he was injured by a lightsaber and is in a coma. Can you give us an account of what happened to him.” Rey swallowed back her grief and looked up, “We were running, once the oscillator exploded we tried to make it back to the Falcon . Ren stopped us. I hit my head and blacked out. When I came to, they were grappling. Then Finn let out this awful scream and fell to the ground.” Aura frowned, “Then how did you escape?” she asked. All eyes turned to her, since she had been silent the entire meeting. Rey stared at her, “I fought him.” She took a deep breath, “Things happened, things I can’t explain very well. People did as I told them, even when they should have turned me in. I could read people’s thoughts---,” several scoffs echoed throughout the room. Leia nodded to the girl to continue. “I made the lightsaber come to me, and I fought him off. I can’t explain it, but he told me “He could show me the ways of the Force.”” Rey stopped talking as Leia Organa and Ackbar spoke to one another quietly. The Admiral gave a stiff nod, “Thank you for your time.” Rey stood up from her seat and started to go. “Wait.” Everyone froze and looked at the newly appointed captain. Aura cleared her throat, “What happened to Kylo Ren? Did he survive?” Rey frowned and shook her head, “I don’t know.” With that she left the room. ************************************************************************** Aura walked down the hall quietly, reflecting on the debriefing. There was something so familiar about that girl, Rey. “Hey, stranger.” She looked behind her and sighed. “Crap. I’m sorry I forgot about lunch, Kyle, I---.” He walked up next to her, “It’s fine. I heard about what happened. Congratulations on the promotion, Captain Keys.” She groaned, “Not you too.” “What?” Aura shook her head, and started to walk slowly back down the hall towards her quarters, “Nothing, I’m just tired.” Warm fingers entangled with hers, “It’s been a long day,” he said. She shook him off, “I’m sorry, I just- you’re right it’s been a long day, and I think I need some rest.” He held his hands up in surrender, “Okay, okay. I’ll see you later then,” he said as he turned on his heel and stalked off. Aura sighed as he disappeared down the hall, Great. Good going, Keys. She opened the door to her room and headed inside. Before the door was closed she was already kicking off her boots and unbuttoning her blouse. She groaned as her head ached. Slipping on an oversized shirt she climbed into bed and went to sleep. ************************************************************************** Dark shadows walk in the night, “It’s the only way, you have to trust me.” “I do, but Ben---.” “I’m doing this for us. It’s the only way we can be together. I love you… So much.” “I love you too.” The taller of the two shuffles and holds out a tiny ring of silver sparkling in the moonlight, “Don’t lose this. It’s all I have to give right now, but maybe---.” A soft sigh travels through the air, “Ben, I don’t need a ring.” “I know you don’t need it, but I want you to have it.” He slips the ring on her finger, “It’s a promise. No matter how far they drive us apart, I will always find you. You're the one, and you always will be, Aura." Chapter 2 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “Damnit girl, wake up!” Aura groaned as a voice yelled in her ear, and a pillow slammed into her face. With a yell she sat up, “Alright, alright, I’m up!” Beads of sweat ran down her face as Skal sat down on the bed next to her, “What’s wrong?” she asked. “You’re what’s wrong. I walked in and you were screaming and biting your arm.” Aura looked down at the arm in question, red teeth marks glaring up at her. She closed her eyes, trying to remember her dream. A man? She shook her head coming up with nothing. “I’m sorry,” she said. Skal whacked her on the arm, “Just don’t start going crazy on me. We get enough of that every day.” The petite blonde stood up from the bed and started to undress. Aura leaned over the side of her bed trying to find the clock, “What time is it?” she asked, as she searched. Rolling onto her stomach she looked underneath the bed and found it. She must have kicked it off the table as she was sleeping. With a sigh she set it on the table, Just past midnight . Silently she laid back down. Skal pushed her bangs back with a pin and took off her earrings. “I saw Kyle on my way to the control room,” she said quietly. “Oh?” Aura asked, as she laid an arm over her face. “He’s worried about you.” Aura bit back a groan, “It’s just been a long week.” “Yeah. Is that why you didn’t tell him you love him?” The red head sat up, banging her head on the bunk above, “Ow!” she pressed a hand against her head and scowled, “He told you?” Skal glanced at her and rolled her eyes, “Of course, he told me. What were you thinking? He’s a wonderful guy!” she said turning back to the mirror. Aura sighed, “He is, but…” “Uh-uh, no buts. You’re going to chase that man away.” The girl pulled on a night shirt and turned off the light and climbed into the top bunk. Anna laid back down and stared into the darkness. “Don’t tell me you don’t care?” Skal asked. “No, it’s not that---,” Aura broke off and sighed. “Then what? You’re scared?”’ “Maybe.” ************************************************************************** Thankfully Skal did not ask any more questions after that. Silencing the alarm, Aura quickly and quietly tiptoed to her locker and got dressed. A snore came from the top bunk and she shook her head as she pulled a pair of socks on. Pulling her hair back Aura slipped into the hall and closed the door with a soft click. “Good morning,” a voice called behind her. With a gasp she whirled around and pressed herself against the door, “General!” “That’s what my file says,” the woman replied with a sly smile, “Aren’t you up early, Captain?” “I---.” “Are you doing anything right now?” Aura shook her head quickly, “No ma’am.” “Good. Come with me.” Motioning for her to follow the general started walking down the corridor. Aura pushed herself away from the door, and fell into step behind her. “I need you to do me a favor,” Leia said as they entered the med bay. She slid a card over a readout and a door that read, “Authorized Personnel Only” opened with a hiss. Quietly Aura followed the woman inside. They stood outside a window looking inside a clean room. The girl from the previous day’s meeting stood next to a bed, looking down at a young man with dark skin. He lay motionless, except for the subtle rise and fall of his chest. The girl leaned down and kissed the man on the forehead before coming out to meet with Leia and Aura, “I’m ready,” she said. Leia nodded and motioned to Aura, “This is Captain Keys. You might remember her from the debriefing yesterday. She’ll help you with anything you might need.” The oldest of the three started for the door, “I’ll see you before you leave, Rey.” With that she closed the door behind her. Aura turned and looked at the younger woman and cocked her head. “You’re leaving?” The girl crossed her arms and looked back into the room, “Someone needs to find Luke Skywalker. General Organa suggested that I take the responsibility. She thinks he might train me.” Aura nodded in understanding, “Because you’re Force-sensitive.” “Pretty much,” Rey rubbed her neck, “Look, I don’t want to be rude, but I need to pick some stuff up from my quarters, and we’ll need some supplies.” “Tell me what you need.” ***************************************************************************** “Make sure the rations are secured, I don’t want them shifting during flight. Oh, and get someone to look at the Falcon’s motivator. The ship’s log says it’s finicky.” The ensign she spoke to gave a nod, “Yes, ma’am.” “Captain,” a voice called out to her. She turned around as Kyle made his way over to her from across the hanger. “Lieutenant Mas,” she said with a nod. She turned back around and checked several items off of her list. “I’m a little busy at the moment---.” The young man cut her off, “General Organa asked me to see if you needed any assistance.” Aura turned and looked at him in surprise. She forced her eyebrows down and shook her head, “No, I---everything is fine,” she motioned to a stack of supplied being pushed up the ship’s ramp, “In fact, we’re almost done.” Kyle looked away from her, “Alright,” he said as he started to walk away. Aura shook her head and hissed after him, “Kyle!” He kept walking. She started to follow him when someone shouted after her. “Captain!” She turned around and instantly saluted, “General.” “At ease. I thought I’d come check on your progress.” Aura frowned, “Lieutenant Mas was just here---.” Leia looked at her in confusion, “Who?” Aura looked back the way Kyle had disappeared, “No one,” she said with a grim smile, “My mistake.” The general gave a nod, “So how’s it going? Did you have someone check out the---?” “Motivator? Yes, the mechanic is looking at it now.” “Good, that thing’s been a pain in the ass since before you were born.” ****************************************************************************** Aura stood off to the side as the General and Rey had a semi-private word. She looked around the landing pad. Everyone on the base had turned out to see the Millennium Falcon off. Rey started to walk to the ship, when Leia called after her, “Rey.” The young woman turned around slowly, “May the Force be with you,” Leia finished. With a nod Rey walked up the ramp without another word. Slowly the ramp pulled up and the engines fired. Hot wind blew over them as the ship took off, flying through fog and clouds until it disappeared. Leia walked over to Aura and stood next to her, “What now?” the Captain asked. The older woman sighed and shrugged her shoulders, “Now we wait.” ************************************************************************** Three Months Later… “Control, this is Rogue One. We’re coming home.” Aura keys slumped in her chair as the control room burst into celebration. Leia walked over and patted her on her shoulder, “Nice work, Keys.” The girl blinked the exhaustion from her eyes. The mission she had been working on for two months had finally paid off. Rogue squadron had successfully pulled off an attack on a First Order Star Destroyer and mining station. That should keep the bastards busy , she thought as she stared at the computer screen. She pinched the bridge between her eyes and winced as a dull ache rumbled through her brain. Leia called over to her, “Why don’t you get out of here?” Aura glanced at her, “Are you sure?” Leia waved her off as she moved through the crowd and disappeared. Picking up a stack of data pads, Aura left the room behind. She kept to herself as she passed several people by. “Congrats, captain,” someone called as she turned around the corner. “Thanks---,” she said as she looked behind her. Crash! With a gasp she ran into a tall muscular body, and the data pads she had been holding scattered all over the floor. She shook her head and started picking them up. Two black boots stopped in front of her as she crouched down. “Sorry about that Captain.” She looked up as she recognized the voice. “Lieutenant…” she said quietly as he knelt down and helped her pick up the mess. They were silent until they both stood up, “I can take those,” she said motioning with her chin to the pads in his hands. “I’ll walk with you,” he said with a smirk. “Kyle---.” He leveled his blue gaze at her, “Come on. Would it kill you to be around me for a few minutes?” She shook her head and walked past him silently. He quickly fell into step beside her. “So, I heard the mission was a success.” Aura winced as another wave of pain stung her brain, “Yeah, they’re on their way back now.” Kyle nodded, “That’s good.” “Mmhmmm.” They walked down the corridor in silence after that. When they reached her room she put her stack of data pads in one arm and opened the door. She set them inside and turned back to take Kyle’s but he was already right next to her, the door sliding closed behind him. She cleared her throat, “Thanks,” she said as he set them down next to her pile. “Don’t mention it,” he said straightening up. She could feel his eyes looking her up and down. “Look, Kyle…” “I just want to talk, Aura. I mean you’ve been avoiding me ever since we…” he trailed off. Aura moved away from him, “I’m sorry,” she said. She meant it. He shook his head, “Don’t. I don’t want you to be sorry. I want you to--- just tell me, why do you keep shutting me out?” “I don’t know.” She sat down on the bed and avoided his gaze, “You don’t know?” he scoffed. Slowly he crouched down in front of her. “I told you, I love you. I still do.” He took her hand in his and she looked at him, her green eyes swimming with sadness, “Please Aura, don’t shut me out again.” Tears rolled down her cheeks as she looked down at him. Reaching up he wiped them away with the pad of his thumb. One hand cupped her cheek, pulling her down to meet him. Sweetly, tenderly, his warm lips pressed against hers. Closing her eyes she reached for him, fisting the fabric of his blue uniform in her hands. He moved up and against her, his hands slipping beneath her shirt, stroking her sides. Leaning back she laid on the bed as he moved over her. Heatedly he began to unbutton her shirt, slowly, teasingly. Once it was open he looked down at her staring at her lustfully, as though he was fighting to keep control of himself. His hands trailed up her stomach before he palmed her breast through her bra. Bending down he licked and kissed his way from her mouth, down her neck, and to her collarbone. She let out a groan as he sucked on her skin, and her hands carded through his hair. Reaching down he pulled down the cup of her bra, and moved slowly, his eyes never leaving hers until his heated mouth closed around her nipple. Letting out a groan she arched her back. “Ben…” The man on top of her froze. Aura’s breath caught in her throat as she came back down from what pleasure she was experiencing. Kyle rolled off of her. “Who’s Ben?” he whispered. Aura sat up pressing her arms against her chest trying to cover herself up, “I don’t know,” she whispered back, her eyes wide-open in shock and mortification. Her heart was racing, What the fuck? Kyle looked at her, “You don’t know? Then why are you calling out his name when I’m ---,” anger shone in his eyes and his hands balled up into fists, “Is this why you been---?” “Kyle, no, I didn’t mean to say that, I don’t even know why I would,” she placed a hand on his arm but he shook her off. “Kyle,” she said as he stood up. She followed him, “I’m sorry, I didn’t meant to do that. It just came out.” The young man pushed past her, “This was a mistake,” he said, as he opened the door. Without another word he stepped outside. Skal’s voice came in through the open door, “Hey, Kyle---.” A blonde head of hair poked in through the door way a few seconds later. “What’s got his knickers tied in a--- Hey, what’s wrong?” she asked as she closed the door behind her. Aura let her hands fall away from her chest, baring her open shirt and all that lay beneath it as tears poured down her cheeks, “Skal…” **************************************************************************** Aura stared up at the ceiling as Skal snored next to her. The girl had fallen asleep on her bed as they talked about the Kyle incident. She pressed a hand to her forehead, Where did that come from? Who was this Ben, and why did she have to say his name just as… Aura looked at Skal as the girl rolled over and let out a snort. I’m going crazy, Aura thought, That has to be it. I’m finally losing it. A beeping sound came from the communication system linked to their room. With a silent groan, Aura climbed over Skal and hit the button. “Captain Keys, please go to General Organa’s quarters ASAP.” Aura pulled on her clothes, and as fast as she could as she punched the button on the wall telling them the message had been received. Skal groaned as she peeked out from beneath a pillow on the top bunk. “It’s four in the morning,” the girl whined. Aura shushed her, “Just go back to sleep,” she murmured as she ran out of the room. The halls were empty so she took off in a jog. When she reached the door to the general’s quarters she pressed the buzzer. No answer. She pressed it again. With a hiss the doors opened and she went inside. Leia was hunched over her desk, “Sorry to wake you.” “It’s fine, ma’am. Is something wrong?” “We need to head to the control room. I just received word that the First Order was seen on the outskirts of this system.” The woman secured her belt and walked to the door. “Shouldn’t we be sounding an alert?” Aura asked. Leia pointed up at the ceiling just as lights and horns began to blare. “Attention all personnel, this is not a drill. Please proceed to your positions. All civilians proceed to the evacuation transports.” The two women looked at each other as people began to poor out of their rooms. With a nod the captain and general ran down the hall. Aura opened the door as Leia walked inside, “What do you have?” she asked. A young analyst, one Aura did not know very well spoke up, “Two Star Destroyers inbound. Several fighter squadrons are beginning to break through the atmosphere.” Aura grabbed a headset and began issuing orders, “Rogue squadron, you are clear for take-off. Intercept at bearing N57°E.” Poe’s reply came over the radio. She turned back to the General, “They’re outnumbered.” Leia nodded. “Fire the Ion Cannon as soon as the first star destroyer is in range. That’ll buy us some time.” Not much , Aura thought as she looked up at the map. The ships were getting closer by the second. Everyone stilled as a pilot’s voice came over the radio, “They’re behind me I can’t shake them---.” Rogue 4’s stat light went out. Leia met Aura’s eyes, “Bring them back,” she ordered, “Have them escort the transports.” Still staring at the screen, Aura relayed the woman’s orders. “They’ll be here in twenty seconds,” someone murmured. Everyone stopped breathing. A muffled explosion echoed off in the distance. Aura looked around the room. Boom! The room shook as tie-fighters began their bombardment. Aura kept her balance by grabbing onto her desk as everyone else stumbled. Sparks rained down on them and the lights flickered overhead. Gasps and screams came from the control room personnel. Boom! Boom! Boom! Aura covered her face as metal fell down from the ceiling and smoke filled the air. Her ears rung as she laid prone on the floor. “Captain Keys!” she looked up. Coughing from the smoke and dust, Leia helped her stand up. A tall figure stood behind the woman, covered from head to toe in grime and dirt, that she almost did not recognize him. “Kyle,” she coughed. He looked to the General, “Ma’am we need to get you out of here.” They all looked around the room. Half of it was covered in rubble. There was no sign of movement. No sign of life. Leia shook her head a blood ran down the side of her face, “Someone has to fire the cannon. The transports won’t stand a chance without it.” “I’ll do it.” Leia and Kyle looked at her. Aura stared up at the man, “Lieutenant, you will escort the General to her transport.” He tried to say something back, but she cut him off, “That’s an order.” Leia shook her head, “Aura---.” “I can set it to fire on the predicted path of the Destroyer. Once the ship enters firing range the computer will take over.” She ran to the nearest computer console that was still viable, “I’ll catch up with you later.” She looked over at them, “Go.” Leia grit her teeth, “Good luck.” Together the two disappeared leaving Aura behind. “Alright, baby, work with me.” ****************************************************************************** Hooded and cloaked a dark figure stood at the helm of the Finalizer. “I feel you,” he murmured as he observed the fighting, “Mother…” A pale faced man with red hair walked up behind him, “Lord Ren, the Tiaze is almost within firing range of the Resistance’s Ion Cannon. What are your orders?” The dark Jedi spun around his robes billowing out behind him, “Have my shuttle readied.” “Sir, there’s no reason for you to go down to the planet, my men---.” The man stopped his hands clenching into fists down at his sides, “It is a family matter. You will do as I command, General.” He stalked off. Hux shook his head and narrowed his eyes like a snake watching its prey, “As you wish, milord.” Notes: Comments and Kudos have been known to make me write faster... If you're looking for that next chapter. Chapter 3 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “No, no, no, come on you stupid---,” Aura pulled her hand back ready to smack the side of the computer, when a green light glowed on the screen. She threw her hands up in the air, “Yes!” She looked at the map, or what was still visible on it. The first Star Destroyer, would be within firing range in ten minutes. Dusting off her hands she punched in the firing codes, then ran to the door. An alert sounded throughout the halls, “Intruder alert, intruder alert. Enemy personnel have entered the base. Hanger B-12 is occupied” Aura looked down the hall. The First Order had arrived, and they were right where the General’s emergency transport was. ******************************************************************* Leia crouched down as Stormtroopers ran by their position. She glanced at the young man kneeling next to her and nodded. She held up three fingers drawing them down one-by-one. “ 3, 2, 1…” she mouthed. The way was clear and they both rose from their positions. Quietly they both ran, passing bodies and scorched droids on their way. Bending over they each took blaster rifles from the fallen. They would need them. “They’ll have the hanger blocked off by now,” the lieutenant said as they jogged up the hall. Leia shook her head, “It’s our only way out of here.” “Yes, ma’am.” Swiping her card she opened the side entrance door to the hanger, and bent over as she walked inside. Leia and Kyle hid behind a damaged x-wing and looked as a group of storm troopers surrounded the ship. The pilots were knelt on the ground, with their hands held behind their heads. A commando stood in front of them. He turned to his men and pointed down at the pilots with two fingers. As the sound of blaster fire echoed off of the metal walls, Leia turned away. Several screams followed, with more blaster fire. Kyle started to rise up, but she grabbed ahold of his shirt pulling him back down. She stared into his eyes and shook her head, “ Don’t,” she mouthed. It was two against a whole unit. They would not stand a chance. He looked away with a silent snarl, as the Stormtroopers massacred the civilians. The hanger doors opened and another battalion marched inside. Leia peered around the side of the ship and let out a gasp. As the soldiers dispersed a tall black cloaked figure walked through the smoke. “Ben…” ****************************************************************************** Aura stared at the rubble blocking the hall. “Great,” she murmured. She kicked at the metal and debris, but it would not budge. Footsteps pitter pattered behind her and a familiar voice yelled at her. “Put your hands where I can see them!” She put her hands up and spoke over her shoulder, “Skal put the gun down.” Slowly she turned around the young woman staring at her wide-eyed. Her uniform was torn, and covered in dirt and grime. Red blood was smudged on her face as it coagulated in her hair. Skal’s hands shook as she stared at her. “Aura?” “Here, give me the gun. I’d really like to not get shot today.” Slowly she reached out towards Skal and took the pistol away from her. Skal slumped against a wall. Aura looked down at the gun, and chuckled, “How were you going to shoot me? The safety’s still on.” Skal cried, “I don’t know… I got separated from the Evac group. Then the bastards started bombing, and---.” Aura put a hand on her shoulder, “Listen to me,” she said staring into the girl’s eyes, “I need you to focus, alright?” Skal bit her lip and gave a small nod. Aura pulled her up off the wall and pushed the woman behind her back, “Just stay behind me, okay?” With a sigh they started down the hall. “Where were you?” Skal asked. “Priming the Ion cannon,” she looked down at her watch, “We have about five minutes before the transport leaves without us.” She looked glanced over her shoulder, and Skal stared back at her. “Then what the hell are we standing around talking for?” ***************************************************************************** A familiar voice cut through her heart, “Find the rest of them now.” Footsteps began to march by. Leia held her hand out to Kyle, “Wait, here,” she whispered. He frowned as she stood. She glanced at him once more and he stilled. The contingency of storm troopers and their leader passed by their hiding spot. Silently she walked out behind them and watched. The man in black stopped as a sea of white armored troops continued to pass him by. Slowly he turned around. Taking a deep breath, her face hardened as they stared one another down. “Ben,” she said quietly. With one hand he pulled back his hood. A jagged scar ran from the center of his brow, down his left cheek beneath his eye, until it tapered off at his jaw. Red eyes burned as he stared at her, “That is not my name.” Leia narrowed her eyes, and held up her hands, “It’s the only thing you will never be able to destroy. You will always be Ben Solo, Kylo Ren is just a fiction.” “Your son is gone,” he said taking a step forward, as two commandos moved to assist him, “He died the day his father did.” She held her ground, “Not from where I’m looking. My son is still alive. I feel it, just as I know, you still feel the light---.” Leia grabbed at her throat as he advanced. The tips of her boots dragged across the floor as she hung in the air. Her son’s face moved in front of hers mere inches away, “There is no light. Only death. I trusted you. My own family left me to die.” He took a step back and watched her, “But I survived. Only to find that you took her from me.” Leia choked, “B—en.” “Let her go!” Kylo Ren looked to the side. Leia felt the force lessen on her throat. She glanced over as Kyle came out pointing his gun at them. She cried out as an invisible hand cut off her airway once more. VNNNNNNNN. His red lightsaber ignited in his hand, sparking as he pointed it, “Kill him,” he ordered his men. The two commandos took aim. ************************************************************************** Skal worked on closing the blast doors as Aura covered her, “Work faster!” she yelled. A voice cried out as she hit a trooper in the center of his chest. “I’m trying!” Skal barked. Aura ran to the other side of the door as blaster fire shot towards her. She crouched down and let off several more shots, “Try faster---!” “There!” Skal said as the door slammed closed. The two women looked at one another panting heavily. Aura shook her head and grabbed Skal by the arm, and they took off down the hall. “This way,” she said as they took a left, then a right. She slowed down and hefted the vibrosword she had stolen from one of the armories they had passed. Skal hissed behind her, “I thought you were an analyst.” They came to a fork in the corridor, and Aura peered to the left and then the right, “I am.” “Then where did you learn to shoot like that?” Skal said as Aura chose the left hallway. Aura stopped, and frowned. She’d always been handy with a blaster, ever since she could remember. She looked at the sword at her side, “I don’t---.” Boom! The ground shook and they each leaned against a wall for support as the ground beneath them shook. They looked at one another. “Why are they bombing with their troops inside?” Aura looked at her watch, “That wasn’t a bomb.” Skal looked at her in disbelief, “Then they left without us.” She slumped, but Aura grabbed her arm, “There still might be another ship in dock. Come on.” Aura pushed Skal in front of her as they ran down the hall. When they reached the service door Skal hunched over the console and hacked in, since neither of them had the code. With a hiss the door opened. Skal walked inside and almost started to speak when Aura pushed her down, “Shhh.” Quietly she peeked over the mechanic station they were hidden behind. A group of storm troopers marched further into the base, leaving behind two commandos, a cloaked figure, and a familiar face. Aura glanced back at Skal, “It’s the general.” Both women peeked over the desk and watched. They were too far to hear anything, but Aura let out a gasp as the cloaked man pulled back his hood. Pain flashed through her head and she hunched down and bit into her arm to stop her groans. Skal put a hand on her shoulder, “Aura?” she whispered. The Captain waved her off as she rocked back and forth on the ground in silent pain. Red light flashed in front of her eyes and a scream echoed in her ears. She looked at Skal, who was mouthing something at her, but no sound came out. Breathing heavily, Aura leaned against the desk as visions of people she had never seen before flitted through her mind. The only face she recognized though, was standing just a hundred feet or so away. Then the pain was gone. Aura looked up and shook her head as Skal stared at her. Wiping her face she got on her knees and looked back at the general. A name moved past her lips as she stared at the man, “Ben?” It felt familiar on her tongue. Skal tensed as the man advanced forward holding his hand up as the general began to claw at her throat and float off of the ground. Aura stood up and took aim. “Let her go!” a voice yelled. Kyle walked out from behind an old x-wing and pointed his gun at the man. Red light erupted from the hand of Leia’s attacker, a lightsaber with a fiery hilt. Red sparks flew from it. The man pointed the tip of the weapon at Kyle and the two commandos moved to take aim. Aura knew what they were doing and began to run towards them. She let off two quick shots, hitting the commandos straight in the back. With screams of pain they fell to the ground, “Kyle, run!” Leia fell to the ground as the man turned on her, and pure terror flew through her belly. ************************************************************************** His men fell to the ground, dead. “Kyle, run!” The voice echoed in his mind and his breath caught in his throat. It can’t be. He let the old woman loose, and turned just in time to block the shot of a pistol. Bright green eyes stared at him from beneath a mess of red curls. He stepped towards her and she pointed her gun at him again, fear glowing in her eyes. She looked past him as the man from before moved behind him helping the old woman off the floor. He looked back at the red head. A blonde woman moved out from underneath a desk behind the girl. Slowly, he lowered his weapon. “Aura,” he said quietly. Her face turned pale, “How do you know my name?” she asked, as she shifted her body. Understanding washed over him. Anger built up and he tightened his grasp on the hilt of his saber as he looked down. A shuddering breath left him. Closing his eyes he tried to sense her in the Force, but she wasn’t there. There was nothing, but a changed mutated connection. Opening his eyes he started towards the girl. A choked and hoarse voice spoke behind him, “Ben, don’t do this. She doesn’t know.” “Why is that?” he yelled at the general, “Because you stole her from me.” His anger focused on Leia and he changed his course. “She trusted you, and you broke her.” Leia closed her eyes as he lifted his lightsaber and swung down. “No!” a voice yelled. Quicker than light, she was there between him and his mother. She lifted her sword and met his attack. Her knees buckled under his power. He stared down at her, in shock. Taking the opportunity, she pushed him with all her might, sending him stumbling back. Finding his balance he stared at her, as the blonde woman from before moved to join Leia. “Get out of here,” Aura ordered the group, her eyes never leaving his, “I’ll buy you some time.” The man she had called Kyle stepped forward and reached for her, “Aura.” She stepped out of his reach, “Go,” she said in a low voice. Leia and the blonde pulled him back and ran. Burning red eyes watched them escape. He didn’t care. Not anymore. She paced in front of him, ready to defend them as they retreated into the transport. She stopped and glared at him, “What are you waiting for?” She raised her sword as he stared at her. “You don’t know who I am. Do you?” he said over the sound of engines firing. Her brow furrowed, “Why should I? I don’t know you.” The words hit him like a shot from an ion blaster. Looking down he flicked his wrist, deactivating his lightsaber. Lifting his head he began to walk towards her, his hand stretched out. Aura stepped away, “Stay back.” He tilted his head, “I’m not going to hurt you Aura.” The tip of her sword pressed against the center of his chest. He looked down at it then back at her. She spoke through clenched teeth, “How--- do you know my name?” she asked again. His right hand slowly lifted and he pushed the sword to the side. Green eyes watched him fearfully. A low hum filled the air, and she began to sway, like grass in the wind. With groan, her eyes rolled in the back of her head, and she fell forward. Her sword clattered to the ground as he caught her. Bending down he placed an arm beneath her knees, and picked her up. Wind from the ship’s engines washed over them, as the Resistance leader escaped. When the roaring wind and blinding light faded, he looked down and peered into her face. She hadn’t aged a day. Her hair was longer, but it was her. He stretched down and whispered in her ear, as she slept. “I know more than just your name. I know who you really are.” Notes: Yay!!! Now we can figure out just who the crap Aura is!!!! I'm so stinkin' excited to write Kylo/Ben scenes, I could just die!!! Comments and Kudos are my jam! Chapter 4 “You let them escape?!” yelled the Sith lord. The supreme leader slammed his fist down on the arm of his throne. “You had them in your GRASP!” Knelt at the foot of the hologram, his apprentice flinched. “You weak, piteous ---.” The entrance to the holo room opened with a hiss, and the dark Jedi glanced over his shoulder. General Hux strode down the walkway, and bowed before the hologram, “Supreme Leader, we have secured Lord Ren’s prisoner.” The Sith Lord looked down at his apprentice who was glaring daggers at the officer, “What prisoner?” **************************************************************************** Why was she so cold? Green eyes opened to stare at the dimmed lights above, their yellow glow resembling a Tatooine sunset. With a groan Aura sat up, and pressed her fingers to her temples, a dull ache in reverberating through her skull, Where? She stood up and grabbed hold of the wall as her legs wobbled. She was in a cell, with black walls and a large reflective mirror. Then bench she had been laying on jutted out a few feet from the wall. In the center of the room was a table and two chairs. Slowly she made her way to the window, noticing her pristine white clothes. She looked down at herself and ran the tips of her fingers down her torso. The fabric was smooth and hugged her body, bare shouldered it was a stark contrast against the red curls that fell down her shoulders. Hugging herself she felt self-conscious, like several pairs of eyes were watching her from behind the window. Her hand instinctively went to her ring finger, only to find the skin bare. She looked down. A white patch of skin ran across her finger. You’ve got to be kidding. Gritting her teeth, she leaned on one of the chairs, gripping the metal tightly in her hands. Aura stepped back as the door opened and a man dressed in a black officer’s uniform came into the cell. He studied her for a moment before the door closed behind him. Silently he took a seat, and laid out a series of data files. She spoke softly, “Where am I?” Without looking at her he motioned to the other seat across from him, “Please, sit.” “Why am I here?” The man sighed and looked up at her, “Either sit down, or I’ll call the guards and have them tie you to the chair.” They stared at each other for a moment, as Aura refused to move. The officer looked at the mirror behind her and motioned with his hand. Dragging the chair with her, aura backed away from the door. ***************************************************************************** Kylo Ren marched down the hall of the Finalizer , forcing his way past a group of Storm Troopers that were patrolling in the opposite direction. Silently he came to a stop in front of the lift. Leaning forward he punched the button and waited. As he stood there another man stood beside him and waited for the lift. With a smirk the man turned and bowed his head, “I must apologize, Lord Ren, I thought you would share all with his Eminence.” The younger man took a step forward as the door opened. Stepping inside, he turned around and pushed the general from the lift, “I suggest you wait for the next one.” He ignored the satisfied smirk on Hux’s face as the doors closed. An automated voice spoke in the elevator as he descended further into the ship, “Level 4.” “She knows Skywalker as well as I do. She can be an asset.” His master stared down at him, “Or a hindrance. Why are you so concerned that she lives?” “Level 10.” Ren shifted and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Let me train her. I can show her the dark side.” “She may be useful, but you are still my apprentice. A novice does not instruct a novice. Break her. Extract every ounce of information and will. Then, bring her to me. Let me see this broken Jedi.” “Level 17.” The lift came to a stop and the doors opened. With heavy footsteps he marched down the empty hall. Turning left he came to the interrogation cells. Two guards stood outside the door. As he neared them they visibly straightened. Ignoring them he entered the observation room. A young female officer turned around at the sound of the door, and almost dropped her tablet. “Lord Ren, I---.” “Out,” he said his voice low. She walked past him as he peered through the mirror into the next room. Just as she opened the door, he called after her, “Wait,” he said his eyes never leaving their target. The woman walked back into the room and stood behind him with her hands behind her back. “Why is she tied to the chair?” “She did not comply with Lieutenant Lox’s instructions. She fought with the guards, so they stunned her. The chair is a precaution, milord.” “When was this?” “The guards were called in about an hour ago. She regained consciousness within the past ten minutes. She’s groggy and not very coherent.” “Leave,” was his only reply. Once the woman was gone he braced his hands against the wall and turned on the audio system so he could listen. Lieutenant Lox’s voice came through, “What is your name?” The girl’s head tilted to the side, and her voice was slurred, “Aura Keys, Captain, ID: 218579.” Kylo narrowed his eyes at her response. Lox shifted in his chair, “What is your home planet?” “Aura Keys, Captain, ID: 218579.” The man’s hands balled up on top of the table as he grew more and more aggravated, “Where is the Resistance rendezvous in case of an emergency.” Aura’s head tilted back and she spoke to the ceiling, her voice turning gravelly and slow, “Aura Keys, Captain, ID: 218579.” Lox stared at her and she let her head fall forward so she could meet his gaze. They stared at each other, then she began to laugh. Lox looked confused as she shook her head, laughing like a maniac, “I’m sorry, I’m ---ugh, I can’t feel my lips,” she shook her head and chuckled, “I’m sorry.” “Why are you sorry?” “Because I lied. Eheha,” she shifted in her chair pulling against the restraints as she let out a giggle. “About what?” Lox said leaning forward. She leaned forward like she was about to tell him a secret. She spoke very slowly, letting every syllable rest on her tongue an extra second, “Aura Keys… Captain…hehe ID: 579218 .” Lox pushed himself away from the table and waved his key pass in front of the door. As he was walking out, Aura, called after him, “Hey,” she said as she pulled against her restraints, “You can’t just leave me like this!” Once the door was closed she fidgeted with the handcuffs but couldn’t get free. Ren turned off the microphone as Lox came in the room, “Cal, I---.” His face went white, when he saw the dark Jedi staring at him. His data files fell from his hands and he spluttered, “L-Lord Ren, I didn’t realize---.” His hands clawed at his own neck as he was pulled forward. “Who gave you permission to question her?” Lox wheezed and Kylo loosened his powers grip. With a cough the man stuttered out, “Gen-general Hux.” With a yell he flew back as Ren turned back to the observation window. What? He looked around the room, no sign of the girl anywhere. Stepping over Lox, who was struggling to catch his breath, Kylo Ren stepped out into the hallway. The guards from before saluted him as he spoke hurriedly, “Where is she?” “Milord?” one of them asked. With an animal like growl, he pushed past them, “Open this door.” With a swipe of one of the Storm Trooper’s card, he ran into the room. *********************************************************************** Why is everything so… swirly? Aura wondered as he looked around the room after the weird little man left. She tried to move, but something sharp cut into her wrists, “Ow,” she let slip past her teeth. Looking down she tried to peer behind her. Nothing. Setting her feet flat on the floor she tried to stand up, but the chair only went with her. Aura’s vision blurred and she stumbled to the side. With a yelp she tipped over, and fell to the cold ground. With her hands tied to the chair behind her, she tried to use her shoulders to sit up. Nope. Letting out a groan she pressed her cheek against the concrete floor. Maybe the funny little guy will come back, she thought to herself. Her heart leapt as the door opened. A tall man walked into the room, his brown eyes falling on her. Closing her eyes she groaned, “Not you again.” Chapter 5 She watched him as he stalked over to her. Reaching behind her he undid her restraints and she instantly relaxed, as her arms were freed. “Get up,” he ordered. With a glare she pushed herself up on her hands and stood up, rubbing her wrists. The scarred man walked to where her interrogator had been sitting moments before and sat down. “Who are you?” she asked him with jerk of her chin. “My name is Kylo. Sit down.” Aura hesitated and Kylo narrowed his eyes. She cried out as the chair behind her flipped itself over and an unseen force closed around her body. Before she could say or do anything she was sitting across from him. An invisible pressure grabbed her by the wrists and slammed her hands down on the metal table. Terrified she looked down at her hands splayed out over the cool surface, “How are you---?” Kylo cut her off, “I have abilities no normal human being possesses.” “And you use them to force your will on others?” she asked glowering. He raised an eyebrow and looked her up and down, “Don’t tempt me.” Aura shook her head and tried to move her arms, but they wouldn’t budge, “Let me go.” “Answer my questions first.” She stared at him trying to figure out his game. “What do you want to know?” “What’s your name?” “Aura Vel Keys.” Kylo cocked his head, “Place of birth?” “Coruscant.” “Age?” “23.” The man opened his mouth to ask another question, but she quickly cut him off with one of her own, “You need to work on your interrogation techniques. After listening to Rey, I was expecting torture, and mind tricks, not a list of match making questions.” Kylo narrowed his eyes and clasped his hands as he leaned forward. Aura groaned as his power pushed on the back of her neck bending her over the table. “You really believe all of that, don’t you?” A leather gloved hand gripped her by the chin forcing her to look him in the eyes. She stared straight at him and narrowed her eyes, “I don’t follow.” Kylo stood up, and the pressure on her body released. Panting she sat up and watched as he walked over to the mirror. The man stared at his reflection as he reached into the front pocket of his trousers. A small ring of silver emerged and she stood up, “That’s mine.” He turned back to her, “I’ll give it to you, if you tell me where you got it from.” Aura held out her hand, “It was my mother’s. It’s all I have left.” She reached out for it, but his fingers closed around it. “Wrong answer.” Aura cried out as he flicked his wrist and threw her back, her body crashing into the wall. A strong hand closed around her throat, not enough to cut off her air flow, but enough to keep her in place. His face was right beside her, his full, firm lips just inches from her ear, “So unsuspecting, so weak. Everything you know is a lie, Aura.” “You’re lying,” she hissed. Kylo slammed a palm against the wall over her head, “You don’t even know your own name. Keys is just a farce. You were born on Tatooine, a slave, until the Order found you,” He pressed his body against hers, “You have to remember.” She struggled against him, “Let go of me.” “Look at me.” She froze and stared up at him. He shook his head, and pushed back the red curls that were covering her eyes. She closed her eyes when his hand grazed over her skin. “They lied to you, about everything .” Her green eyes flitted open and she stared at his lips, “Who did? I don’t know what you’re talking about---.” “Yet,” he said, stroking her plump, rosy, lips. “You don’t understand yet. But you will.” Aura slumped as he released her and stepped back. He looked down and grabbed her by the hand, “I told you before I left,” he held up her ring before sliding it onto her finger, “I will always find you.” Aura gasped as he stroked the top of her hand. Then he let her go. "You have so much potential, so much underlying power. I only hope the Supreme Leader can see it." Without another word he walked to the door and slammed his fist against the metal twice. It slid open with a hiss, and he glance back at her, one last time, before he disappeared. Chapter 6 “You can’t keep me here forever!” Aura yelled as she slammed her fingers against the two-way mirror. Huffing and seething, she turned around and kicked over a chair. “Bastards,” she mumbled as she plopped down on the bench in the corner of the room. She didn’t know how long she been there, or how long it had been since Kylo had disappeared. All she knew was that patience was not one of her virtues. With a sigh, she pushed back the mess of hair that was hanging over her face, and pulled her feet up off the floor. Closing her eyes leaned her head against the top of her knees. A hiss filled the room and she peeked over her knees to see the door opening. Two storm troopers walked in with unholstered blasters. “Get up,” they ordered. Aura sat up but didn’t move to stand, “Or what?” The troopers glanced at each other. Together they each aimed their guns at her, “Or we stun your ass.” ************************************************************************* “Are you eager to waste my time, Kylo Ren? Where is the girl?” The young man looked up from the pedestal he was knelt upon. A dark figure sat enthroned at the top of a dark marble stairway. “My men are bringing her now---.” He caught himself as the entrance to the room opened. He stood. Two white armored storm troopers dragged the girl in, her feet trailing behind her. “What is this?” he hissed as they stopped next to him. “She refused to follow orders. We had to stun her.” Kylo Ren’s fists balled up at his sides, as he felt a wave of anger coming from the throne behind him, “Leave her,” his master commanded. Ren waved his hand and the two troopers set the woman on the ground then exited the throne room. Red curls fell over her face like a curtain. He looked down at her as he walked past, “She is too defiant,” Snoke murmured as his apprentice stood before him. “She will learn,” the knight answered as he returned to the pedestal, “A strong will can be broken.” “You said her connection to the Force was severed,” Snoke curled his lips back over his teeth as he stared down at them, “I can feel it. She is an abomination.” “What they did to her is the true crime,” Kylo said pointing behind him. A dark laugh filled with mirth echoed throughout the chamber. Gripping the arms of his seat, Snoke leaned forward, “You care for her,” he laughed. Settling back he shook his head, “There is no room for love in your destiny, Kylo Ren.” He waved a hand at the girl, “Destroy her.” “I can train her, she can be of benefit to you.” Snoke narrowed his eyes, “Why would I allow you to train her?” The dark Jedi stared up at the throne with burning eyes, “Because she will trust me, once we show her the truth. Then I can ensure her loyalty to you.” Snoke shook his head, “She would be loyal to you, not me.” “But I am loyal to you,” Kylo said as he and the mysterious figure stared at one another, until a small moan drew their attention away from one another. Tearing away from the Dark Lord’s gaze, Ren looked down at the floor as a hand closed around his ankle weakly. Green eyes stared up at him and he crouched down next to her. Without a work he picked her up by the elbow and forced her to stand, “Hey,” she hissed swatting at his hand. Without a sound he focused on her hand, and locked it into place in mid-air. “What is your name?” Snoke’s voice slithered down to them. Aura looked around and squinted into the darkness. “Tell him your name,” Kylo hissed. “No—guh.” Her eyes filled with terror as her windpipe was constricted by an unseen force. Ren stepped away from her as Snoke cut off her oxygen supply. Her cheeks turned red, as she strained to breath. With a gasp she fell to the ground, when Snoke released his hold on her. She sat on her knees, wheezing for breath. Kylo grit his teeth as he looked down at her. “You would do well to answer my master,” he said. She glared up at him, “Go fuck---.” Blue lightening cut her off and she let out a scream. It tore through her body, and her head tilted back sharply, baring her throat. Veins pulsed beneath her skin as she let out bloodcurdling scream of pain. Ren forced himself to watch, staring at her with an impassive face. His clenched hands told a different story though. After several spurts of electricity, Snoke let his hand fall, and Aura fell to the floor panting and crying. Her body paralyzed, she could only move her eyes, and she looked up at Ren, with murderous hate. He turned away and looked up the stairs, “Please, master, show her the truth.” “There is a barrier in her mind, holding back the tide,” Snoke said as he strolled down the steps slowly, “To bring it down all at once would shatter her consciousness, or kill her.” Silently he came to a stop and stood over the girl, “It must be brought down in pieces.” He waved a hand over her and pushed into her mind. Kylo stood behind him, and grimaced, as the girl began to scream once more. Crossing his arms he watched over them, “Now you will understand, the power of the dark side.” ****************************************************************************** A black and cavernous feeling hangs overhead as Aura opens her eyes. She is knelt on a plateau covered in black sand, a racing cliff inches away from her. Wobbling on her feet, she stands, and hold her arms out as she tries to step away from the cliff. Light shines down from the sky like a spot light, blinding her. Lifting a hand she turns around, twisting away from the light, only to be met by an abyss of black smoke. With a gasp she takes a step back, the heel of her foot hanging off the edge of the cliff. “Shit!” she yells as she swings her arms behind her. Gaining her balance she freezes. “Where am I?” “At the precipice of who you should be,” a voice breathes behind her, “And who you are now.” Aura spins around and winces as the light blinds her once more, as though she is staring into a burning sun. She looks up. A small dark blip moves through the sharp rays of light, coming closer and closer to her, until the figure hangs in the air in front of her, shielding her from the radiating light behind it. A small child, a girl stares down at her, with emerald eyes and hair that glows as though it is on fire. “Who are you?” Aura breathes. The girl comes closer and stares at her blankly. A small hand reaches out towards her, and the woman flinches, before they graze her forehead. “I’m you.” Cool fingers move against her skin and Aura stumbles back, the light leaving her as darkness swallows her whole. It’s hot, and bright, and loud. “Chik, nan wata,” a gruff voice yells. Aura’s mind instantly translates, “ Girl, get in here!” It’s Huttese, a dialect often used by merchants. The woman frowns, How do I know that? With a groan Aura sits up and looks around the space she is in. Concrete walls, with low hanging ceilings, and scrap parts hung and thrown everywhere. A small hand appears in front of her face and she looks up. “Get up,” the little girl commands. Hesitantly, Aura stands on her own, and dusts off her pants. Rolling her eyes her small companion leaves the room, and she follows right behind her. “What is this? How did I get here?” “Just watch.” Aura frowns and looks around the room they are standing in. It is a repair and scrap parts shop, and by the lack of customers, it is also low on business. “Panbocn da brat!” The little girl winks at Aura, and steps forward, “Jee doth ciheu bu kakouwobana,” she yells as she walks over to the counter. A tan Twi’lek male steps into the room, the tips of his orange lekku trembling in annoyance. He raises his hand and the girl flinches. “You come when I call, eh?” he yells as he slaps her. “Yes, Jebbu,” the girl whimpers. He hits her again. Aura yells and steps in front of the girl as he brings his hand down, “Leave her alone---!” The blood orange hand passes through her as though she is made of air and the girl behind her cries out in pain. Aura stumbles back passing through the counter as the Twi’lek grabs the girl by her hair and raises his hand again. She looks down at her hands, and swipes at a bottle of grease on the counter, only to have it travel through the object again. Another cry of pain steals her attention and she looks up as the man beats the little girl. Jebbu’s eyes are filled with rage and he swears in Huttese with every strike. “Hey!” a voice yells catching him by the hand. The alien looks up as a leather gloved fist slams into his face. The girl takes advantage of the chaos and scrambles to hide beneath the counter. Aura crouches down and tried to pull her back, but her fingers slip through the girl’s body. She follows the child’s line of sight and looks to see a young man standing over the shop owner’s body. “Who do you think you are dotkohu?” Jebbu spits. “Shut. Up.” The man hisses as he crouches down to the Twi’lek’s eye level. Gripping the alien’s tunic he pulls him up so they are staring at one another, “Someone brought you an artifact two months ago, and you haven’t been able to open it or sell it. I want it. Now.” The beaten male, slaps at the man’s hands, “Alright, alright, I know what you want. Just let me go.” He falls back as the hand lets him go. His head tails curl in fear as he pushes himself off the sandy floor and he runs into another room. Dusting his hands off on his pants the young man stands, and turns towards the counter. The small body beneath it recoils as he walks over to it and crouches down, “Hey there.” He looks down at her, sandy blonde hair falling over his brow. She is silent. Clearing his throat he holds out a gloveless hand, “I’m Luke. What’s your name?” She stares at him, terrified to answer. Luke frowns, but stands up as Jebbu reenters the room with a bundle in his hands. He holds it out to the man, “You take this. Free of charge.” The man takes the bundle and sticks it into the satchel at his waist. “I want the girl too.” Jebbu narrows his already small eyes, “Girl, is not for sale---.” Luke raises his hand and waves his fingers in the air, “You will sell me the girl.” Aura frowns as the Twi’Lek freezes and his voice goes flat. “I will sell you the girl.” Luke reached into his satchel and handed Jebbu a packet of credits. Crouching down he murmurs to the girl, takes her by the hand and pulls her out from beneath the table. After Jebbu removes the tracking and slave chip from her arm, Luke picks her up can carries her out of the shop, “You’re coming with me kiddo.” Aura passes through the counter and watches them leave. The little girl has her face buried in Luke’s shoulder. She looks up one last time before they disappear, her eyes locking with Aura’s. ***************************************************************************** Kylo held his breath as her back arched off of the floor, and she moaned, “What’s happening to her?” he asked. Snoke stared down at the girl, holding his hand over her body, “She’s remembering. Everything they sealed away, will come back. Eventually.” Aura’s body relaxed again and Snoke let his gnarled hand fall. “Her body is weak.” He turned, “You will accompany her through her training, for a time.” Ren nodded his head, “Do not assume that you are her master. That role will fall to me.” Slowly the Dark Lord made his way back up the steps to his throne. Kylo crouched down at the looking at her sleeping face. Slowly he slid a hand beneath her head, and the other behind her knees. Without a word, he carried her from the chamber. Chapter 7 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “Alright, here we go!” Luke says as he leans down on the ladder and picks up the little girl up and puts her in the copilot seat of the modified x-wing. Standing behind them, Aura watches silently, after having been dragged from the shop, through walls, carts, and one too many Gamorreans to find them readying to leave. She chuckles when Luke fishes out a helmet, three sizes too large and sets it on the girl’s head. They both laugh, as she struggles to see out from underneath it. With one hand he pushes the blast shield back, letting her see. “So, what’s your name?” he asks. “Jebbu.” He cocks his head to the side, “That was the shop owner’s name. Don’t you have one for yourself?” She shakes her head, and he strikes a thoughtful pose, with his hand on his chin, “Well, we’ll have to fix that.” He starts to get into the ship, then turns towards her, “How old are you?” She hold up eight tiny fingers. “You’re eight?” he asks, like it is really big news. She grins and nods her head really quickly. “I have a nephew that age. I think you’ll like him.” With a laugh he hops into the pilot seat, and buckles in. As the cockpit closes he turns around, “Now, for a name. How about Pip?” The girl makes a face and he laughs as he switches on the engines, “Alright, alright, we’ll work on it.” Aura watched as the ship hovered for a moment before taking off and disappearing in the sky. “You still don’t remember,” a voice said behind her. Slowly she turned around, and it was like staring into a mirror. She was facing herself, and she took a step back in surprise, “Why are you showing me this? This isn’t real!” “You need to remember. You need to know what they did to you, how they betrayed you, what they took from you,” her reflection murmured, following after her, eyes turning red, hair blowing wildly in the hot wind. Aura fell backwards, scrambling away from herself in terror. “Just leave me alone!” *********************************************** Strong arms held her up, and she could hear the steady footsteps as she was carried down the hall. Her eyes were heavy with exhaustion and she tried to move, but her body refused. With a tired sigh, she opened her eyes a bit and stared at the ceiling. “Aura.” She looked to the side, brown eyes with flecks of green stared down at her. She blinked slowly, unable to form any words as he studied her with an expression akin to… hope? Biting her lip, she squeezed right hand, hanging limply at her side as he stopped. SMACK! The arms holding her lurched, as he turned his face away, but a second later his grip around her seemed even tighter. She closed her eyes as her hand fell, catching a glimpse of his glare before she turned her head. “Open the door,” he ordered gruffly, and she could hear another set of footsteps moving out of the way quickly. A hiss echoed off the walls, and her world grew darker as he carried her through the door. It slammed closed behind him. Then she was falling, and her heart began to beat rapidly. “Oomph.” She sat up of the bed slowly, and glared through the darkness. It was a small room, immaculate, with only a small table and an uncomfortable looking chair in the corner. A small white footlocker sat at the end of the bed. “You’re more trouble than you’re worth,” the still mysterious Kylo Ren hissed as he went to a large window across from her and typed a code in to a console opening the outer metal shutters. A red glow began to fill the room, from whatever planet or star they were orbiting. “I’m sorry I’m not more entertaining,” she hissed back, as she swung her legs over the edge of the bed, “ Ass.” He narrowed his eyes then stared out the window, “What did you see?” She glanced at him, “Nothing.” A silent, invisible force closed around her throat, and pulled her up and across the room. “You will find that I am not a patient man,” he seethed as he gripped her by the chin. The choking force around her neck dissipated and she gasped for air. Reaching up she gripped his hand and glared up at him. “You always were horrible at hiding your emotions.” “Let go of me,” she said trying to push herself away from him. But he was so much stronger than her, and he gripped her by the shoulders, so tightly that she cried out in pain. “Do you know who I am?” he asked. She looked up at him and spat in his face. He let her go. As he wiped his face, she moved away from him, “I don’t know you, but I know what you are. You’re the same kind of evil son of a bitch, I’ve been fighting against my entire life.” She balled her hands into fists, “I do not know you, and for all you have mystically asserted, you know nothing about me. I don’t know what you put in my head but that is not me .” Blood pounded in her ears as they stared at one another in silence. Then he laughed. He uncrossed his arms, “You’re so angry!” He laughed at her, and she shifted uncomfortably as he stopped suddenly and cocked his head, “We can use that.” Aura took a step back as he started for her, “What are you going to do with me?” she asked raising her head. He looked up and down her body, as her back pressed against the wall. One hand pressed against the metal next to her head, and the other grabbed her hand as she tried to swipe at his face again. He pressed her wrist to the wall and leaned in closely, enough to make her turn her face away before he could touch her. Soft yet terrifying words were whispered in her ear, “I’m going to make you just like me.” Notes: Short chapter but it seemed like an awesome place to stop and make ya’ll wrestle with loving this emo boy. Chapter 8 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) She had been alone for days, locked away in that tiny room, with nothing to do but stare at the fiery surface of some unknown planet. The first day, she had been fine, and the second day wasn’t too rough. Ren had told her to make use of the room as she saw fit, and she had… just probably not the way he meant. She had scoured the room for anything that she could use to get the jump on whoever came to get her first. After a few minutes of knocking over the table and chairs and even trying to heave the footlocker at the door, she realized she was at a terrible disadvantage. But it was the third night when weird shit started to happen. Voices, and shadows haunted her as she curled up in the corner of the bed. Some she recognized as her own, but the others sent a chill down her spine. “ You’ve made your choice.” “Take it away, now, make me forget.” Wrapping a blanket around her she tried to get as much sleep as she could, but it was nearly fruitless. By the time her eyes had just decided that they would like to close and allow her to sleep, two Stormtroopers came into the room. They hurled a set of black robes, including a tight shirt and pants at her, “You’ve got five minutes,” one said, as they left the room. ************************************************************************************* “Where are you taking me?” she asked as they marched her down the dark hallway. “Shut up.” The taller of the two gripped her arm hard enough to leave bruises and hurried her along. Digging in her heels she tried her best to stop. “Let me go---!” The hard butt of a gun buried itself in her back and she let out a strangled scream as she fell forward. She gasped for breath, but they wouldn’t let her rest. No sooner had her hands met the cold floor, they were pulling her up and pushing her forward. Her back and legs screamed in agony as they rushed down the hall. Hot tears of pain ran down her face, and unable to help herself she leaned against the trooper to her right. Eventually, and thankfully, they finally stopped. Aura’s shoulders slumped as the trooper punched a code into a console next to a set of large black doors. With a beep the doors slid open, to reveal nothing but a black, dark room. With a shove from the trooper behind her, she stumbled into the room, and fell to the ground, the shackles around her wrists biting into her skin. With a groan she looked back at the entrance which closed with a hiss, trapping her in darkness. Weak, and in pain she turned back around and laid on her side, her hands pulled up against her chest. The cool tiles beneath her froze to her skin, and with a shudder, she pulled her knees up. “Get up.” A bright light shone down from above blinding her and she sat up, holding her hands over her face as a shield. A voiced boomed and echoed through the room, coming from all directions, “Get. Up.” It sounded muffled as though it was being distorted by a machine. Slowly she stood, still shielding her eyes against the bright lights. A small beep pinged through the room, and her cuffs fell to the floor. Looking down she rubbed her wrists and turned studying the room. The walls were bare, black, and smooth. It was a large room with high ceilings and enough length to run from one end to the other. Letting her arms fall to her sides, she moved towards the far wall, and looked up. A camera with a red dot in its center peered down at her, studying her. She took a step to the left and it followed her. Aura narrowed her eyes. “What do you want from me?!” she yelled. The camera zoomed in on her and she turned her back on it, “Why am I here you bastard?!” Shaking her head she looked down at the floor. What the---? Great streaks ran across the floor randomly, almost like… Claw marks? Aura looked up and turned around, moving slowly to the center of the room as the voice from before turned. “You are afraid. Good. Use it.” The voice cut off as a small cylinder rolled across the floor from a small opening next to the door. Kneeling down she picked it up and opened it. Long and curved, she picked up the black leather hilt. It felt light and fit almost perfectly in her hand as she closed her fingers around it, but what was even more curious was that it felt familiar. With a click she pressed the button. Vnmmmmmmm. A bright purple beam erupted before her, filling the air with a soft electrical hum. That’s when the howling began. Dropping the cylinder and gripping the lightsaber tightly she whirled around. The far wall slid open and three beasts slinked into the room. They were furless and walked on four legs, with great thin tails whipping back and forth behind them. Their paws dragged along the floor as they moved towards her, moving into the light. With red eyes they stared at her, their faces hidden behind mask like bone and cartilage, resembling a human skull. Their great fangs dripped with slobber. Shaking their heads like dogs they tilted their heads back and let horrific, scream like howls. Aura panted as the howls washed over her. “Your left!” a voice screamed in her mind and she turned and swung her sword just as a beast lunged for her throat. The lightsaber cut through the animal searing its flesh and cutting it in half. A howl echoed behind her and she turned around just as another sprung for her. Her sword cut through its shoulder and it turned its body with a yelp. It muscle heavy torso collided with her, and she stumbled back. Limping, the injured beast joined its pack mate and they turned towards her stalking closer and closer. Standing up, she held out a hand and twirled the saber in her right hand. With a yell she ran towards them, and they lunged for her again. Dropping to her knees she bent back, as the injured animal leapt over her, and she swung her sword up, eviscerating the beast. Jumping up, she turned around, but not before the other monster swiped at her with its razor sharp claws, ripping the back of her shirt open, and leaving deep gashes over the small of her back. Turning around, she lifted her arms and brought the saber down on the wolf-like creature’s head. As its shrieks died down, Aura slumped and fell to her knees, deactivating the saber. Her lungs burned and her body screamed in pain. Leaning forward she pressed her palms to the floor and cried in anger, and pain. A small hiss came from the doors across the room, and heavy footsteps echoed. Looking up she saw a tall dark figure moving towards her. “Very good, for your first try,” Kylo said clapping his hands together slowly, a smug smile on his face. Gripping the blood soaked saber, she pushed herself up and ran towards him screaming. He looked at her in amusement but she didn’t care. Jumping forward, she raised her arms and swung, clicking the activation button on the lightsaber. But no light, no blade of light ever came. She stared at the hilt as the man in front of her began to laugh, “Did you really think I would give you a weapon without taking precautions?” Without a word she stared at him, her mind and soul overcome with rage. Too angry and with nothing else to do, she reared back and threw the useless weapon at him. With a flick of his hand he swatted the hilt away before it could even touch him, sending it clattering across the floor. She stared at it in shock. Before she could do anything, he was right next to her, gripping her chin and forcing her to look in him, “Your anger will serve you well, but you need direction.” “And let me guess, you want me to point it towards something, other than you?” she hissed. Kylo shrugged and glanced over her head, “Preferably, yes.” “You can’t control me,” she said pushing herself away from him. He narrowed his eyes, “At this moment you still have that will of yours. But let’s give it another hour of fighting like this, another day, perhaps a few weeks? In the end, you’ll be exactly like me.” Aura shook her head, “I’d rather---.” “Die?” he asked, crossing his arms, “That can be arranged.” “Why are you doing this?” she asked stepping further away from him. He clenched his jaw, “It’s what I am now, Aura. You can’t change it, and neither can I.” He shifted and looked at her pointedly, “You once told me you would do anything for me--- well, now is your chance to prove it.” “I never said that!” she said crossing her arms. The dark Jedi looked at her blankly and she looked down, pushing her hair behind her ear, “And if I did, I don’t even remember---.” “You will remember, though, eventually,” he said turning on his heel and going back to the door. Aura turned around as more howls echoed from across the room. Kylo Ren turned around and looked at her coldly as the doors slid closed, “Even if I have to pry it from your mind until it breaks.” Notes: Well... Kylo is much darker and creepier in this fic than my others at least, so there's a difference in plot!!! Chapter 9 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) The last Howl-Runner fell to the ground with a scream, as Aura cut it in half. With a groan she fell to the ground gripping her leg where a stray swipe from one of the creatures had caught her thigh. “Shit,” she breathed as she pressed her hand to it, panting for breath. Corpses littered the floor, and blood covered her feet and drenched her clothes. How long? she wondered. The beasts came in packs of three, and once they were dead her captors would let her rest for how long she didn’t know. She had soon learned that the faster she cut the animals down the more time she had to rest. The lights above flickered and she looked up, “AURA!” a voice yelled and she buckled forward, as a sharp pain cut through her head. The lights flashed and she closed her eyes, but the next time she opened them the room was gone and in its place was a dark forest being torn apart by roaring wind. Rain poured down and lightening flashed above. “Watch out!” that same voice yelled again. Spinning around Aura stood, a Howl-runner larger than any other she had seen was stalking towards her, with its teeth bared. With a gasp she looked down for her lightsaber, but it was gone. Shit! She thought as she looked back up, the beast growing closer and closer. Vnmmmmmmmm. Blue light and a dark figure jumped in front of her and a low thrum filled the air. Screams and the sound of a lightsaber cutting the animal down filled her ears. Soon, all that was left was the sound of the wind and the rain. The figure in front of her turned around and she gasped. You? With long black hair he looked at her with those same green-brown eyes, the only difference was that he bore no scar. Clipping his lightsaber to his belt, he moved towards her, “Get up,” his lips continued to move as his voice ended, and it sounded so far away, like he was yelling from a great distance. But his eyes stared at her kindly, so different from the hard gaze she had begun to grow accustomed to. This man… He was different from the one she knew. This wasn’t Kylo Ren. He mouthed something again but she heard nothing. Aura moved away from, him and he stared at her wordlessly. His voice filled her ears but it was not coming from the man in front of her, “I said, get up!” A howl broke through the air and she fell to the floor as a Howl-Runner’s head rolled across the floor to her. The forest was gone and she was back in the black room. “Aura,” his voice drifted to her and she looked up as Kylo crouched down in front of her. Her body swayed and he set a hand on her shoulder. She studied his face, his scar back where it belonged and those same eyes staring into hers. Tears fell down her face and his eyes widened. “Just kill me, or let me go,” she whimpered as her body began to shake. Kylo’s hand dropped and he narrowed his eyes. *********************************************************************************** She’s been fighting for the past two days, how much longer can she stand it? He wondered as he stared at the computer screens. Aura cut through the last howler, her grip on her saber loosening until it slipped from her grasp. Even from a distance he could tell she was exhausted, from the way her entire body seemed to tremble. Slumping forward, she fell to her knees, pressing her palms to the floor to keep her from fully collapsing. Running his hand through his long hair, Ren glance at the clock, Five minutes until the next wave. He looked back at Aura, she didn’t have much longer to rest. Get up! He grit his teeth and looked the control technician. Soon the countdown was in its last digits. Ren looked back at the screen. She was still on the floor the release door for the beasts opening slowly. Her eyes were rolled back in her head and she was staring up at the ceiling, with her mouth gaping open, her back arched in the thrall of what he assumed was some kind of a seizure. “Shut it down,” he hissed. The technician stared at him in terror, “Sir, I can’t, the command is locked in.” The man flinched as Ren through his hand up, sending the officer sprawling backwards out of his chair as the dark Jedi ran to the door. The door opened a couple door down from the training grounds. Two guards stood in front of the doors, “Open it,” he yelled. One of the men punched in his code and the door opened. Not stopping for a moment, he ran inside. Vnmmmmmm. Red light crackled from his saber, as his eyes adjusted to the dark. Three creatures glanced at him with red eyes, before continuing to surround their prey: Aura who sat on her knees staring into oblivion. Running forward, he brought the blade down on cutting through the animal from shoulder to hip, with a sizzling cut. The animal fell to the floor, with a guttural scream. “Get up!” he yelled to Aura. She turned her head and looked at him--- no, through him, as though she was somewhere else. The other two beasts turned towards him, jumping through the air. Dropping down he swung up, eviscerating the alpha male, and spun on his knees, just as the bone covered face of the last creature snapped its jaws right in front of his face. With a thud the head flew from the shoulders and rolled until it was just a few feet away from the woman. “Aura,” he murmured as he stood. Deactivating his weapon he clipped it to his belt. Aura shook her head, and closed her eyes as he drew closer. Quietly he crouched down in front of her. Tears fell down her cheeks and his brow furrowed. “Just kill me, or let me go,” she whispered looking back up at him. “I can’t,” he whispered. Aura wiped her face, “You can’t what? Kill me? Or let me go?” She stared at him, as he refused to answer. “ Who are you?” She looked up at the ceiling, letting her shoulders slump forward, “I can’t know you, but I feel like---.” “You’re starting to remember,” he said smoothly. She frowned, “It’s not… me though, in these memories, and it’s not you. You’re different. Changed.” He narrowed his eyes, “I told you, I’m not that man anymore.” “Then why do you keep insisting that I remember?” she spat, “What’s the point?” Kylo looked down, “I---.” “Lord Ren, it was brought to my attention that there was a situation,” A voice said. They looked to the door, and Kylo stood. A group of guards, armed to the teeth, stood behind the man. “You aren’t needed here, General.” The man glanced at Aura, still on the floor, “As you wish. I assume that the Supreme Leader will hear about this in your report?” Kylo was silent. With a dark chuckled, Hux turned on his heel, “Hmmm. Good to see where your interests truly lie.” The group of troopers disappeared behind him, leaving Aura and Kylo alone. “Ren?” she whispered behind him. His chest seized and he turned around. She was staring at her blood covered hands, the silver ring on her finger glinting in the light from the open doorway. He looked down and held his hand out. She stared at it for a second, before standing on her own. His hand fell to his side as she snubbed him. It was a small act of defiance. Her body swayed from side to side, and he shook his head. “No one knows you are here, Aura. I can do whatever I want with you. Wouldn’t it be easier to just give in?” Aura looked him straight in the eye and shook her head, “I don’t give in no matter how easy it might be. If you really know me, then you would understand that.” Ren turned his head, still looking at her. With a flick of his wrist, he willed her lightsaber to his open hand, pulling it up from the floor behind her. He stared down at the weapon, “Then you’re leaving me no choice,” he replied, his voice going cold. Stretching out he held the butt of the hilt out to her. With a tired snort she took it from his hand, her fingers grazing over the back of his gloved knuckles, “We all have a choice, you’re just too scared.” Kylo said nothing, “Fight well,” he said, turning on his heel. Pulling up his hood he strode towards the door, his black robes billowing out behind him as he stepped over the Howl-runner carcasses, “And try to survive. I won’t save you a second time.” Notes: The song Memories keeps playing in my head lol. Comment, kudos, yadda, yadda, yadda... Chapter 10 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Kylo watched though the observation window as Aura collapsed against the far wall as the guards exited the room. A month gone in seconds. Did she know how much time had passed? He crossed his arms and wondered if time blurred together for her like it had for him when he---. Setting his jaw he watched her as she leaned her head against the metal wall and closed her eyes. Her clothing was filthy from days of simulations, and sleepless nights of fighting off beasts from Kashyyk, mercenaries from the outer rim, and Hssiss from Vijjun. He ordered the simulations stopped every two days, giving her a short time in the bacta tank. They had not spoken a word since the last time she had seen him, and he ordered the guards and medical staff to be completely silent in her presence. Physically, she was at the breaking point. He only had a vague idea of where she was at mentally. The door to his left opened with a soft hiss, and the sound of heels clicking on the grated floors drew his attention from the window. A young officer stood with her back straight, and her hands balled up into fists at her sides, “I’m sorry to disturb you Lord Ren, but the Tijjan Ren will be arriving soon. General Hux requests that you be the first to greet her.” “What hanger?” he murmured turning back to the window. Aura had completely collapsed and was laying on her side in the fetal position. “54-B,” the officer replied. Narrowing his eyes, Kylo turned away from the cell and moved towards the door, the lieutenant moving out of his way, “Clean her up, dress her, and bring her to the observation deck.” He looked the woman up and down, “Bring as many guards with you need.” ************************************************************************************* Ren walked between the rows of soldiers leading to the end of the landing platform, when a small ship awaited. As he started up the stairs the ramp opened with hissing steam and a short, darkly cloaked figure strode down to meet him. Leather bound fingers, with black painted claws lifted up to pull back the hood, and he stared into the yellow, red rimmed, eyes of Tiijan Ren. Her black tinted lips were pulled tight, and she inclined her head, showing the sharp horns jutting out from beneath her long black hair. “Lord Ren, what an honor it is to see you again.” His eyes followed her as she bowed down. “Tiijian,” he growled as she straightened her back. “We were not expecting you, Lady Ren,” Hux’s nasal voice cut through the air behind them. They turned and Tiijian narrowed her eyes. “I am merely a Knight of Ren, not the master of the order,” she said throwing a sneer at Kylo, “Such a title is above me.” Hux came to a stop, his face impassive as he stared at the two of them. He bowed his head, “My apologies.” Tiijian bared her teeth and sauntered down the steps without them, “You are forgiven General, and do not trouble yourself with deciding how to address me, if Lord Ren has followed his orders, I shouldn’t be here too long.” The two men stood and watched as two officers led the Zabrak from the hanger. Huffing, the General stepped closer to Kylo and hissed, “What the hell was that?” With his mouth in a hard line, the dark Jedi stomped down the steps, “It is none of your concern.” *********************************************************************************** She felt barely human. Like a sack of parts, mainly reflexes and adrenaline. Cool water poured down on her as the female guard shoved her into the shower, and she swayed from left to right in a dazed state. Everything was slow: the water, the sound of her breathing, the bat of her eyelids opening and closing. “Hurry up,” the guard ordered. Aura stared at the white wall in front of her, a small smile playing on her lips for the first time in however long she had been held prisoner by the First Order. How long had it been since she had heard a voice other than her own? “Alright,” she answered back compliantly, taking the soap and washing away the filth she was covered in. Three words was all their conversation had been, but as she stood there, she knew that there was a chance that she was still sane. When the water shut off she was dragged from the shower and thrown into a large room, with two women waiting for her. It was some kind of eclectic lounge. It had elegant furniture, from different cultures. She looked around as they started for her, catching a glimpse of a large observation window in the back of the room. Without a word the two women grabbed her and set her on a black pedestal in front of a mirror. Silently she stared at herself, in her nakedness. Was this her? Her face seemed thinner, her cheek bones sharper, her eyes duller. The rest of her body was covered in scars and bruises. Muscles moved beneath her skin that hadn’t been there before. It was all a result of fighting for her life. Reaching down as they draped meshes material over her shoulders, her fingers ran over the claw marks across her stomach from the dragon like beasts she had fought for days. She pressed against the scar on the left side of her torso beneath her arm, where the Noghri assassin had tried to stab her through the heart only to end up grazing her when she lurched to the side. Every day ended the same way. She lived, they didn’t. Swallowing, Aura shook her head, and tried to focus on the women, as they dressed her. They were older, lanky and wrinkled, and they adamantly avoided her gaze. Ne dressed her in dark blue robes while the other pulled her hair back into a tight braid. When they were done they tried to paint her lips with a black liquid but she pushed them away. They looked at one another then left her alone in the room. *********************************************************************************** Kylo stalked past the black amored gaurds and entered Tiijian’s room. She sat with her back to him, staring at space through the observation window. “Why have you come here?” he asked as he moved behind her. “Snoke has lost faith in you. You’ve stopped reporting your progress, you’ve ceased your mission to find Skywalker. He would have sent me sooner if not for my counsel.” The man scoffed, “So you bend the Supreme Leader’s ear now?” Twisting around, she bared her fangs at him, “You might be his favorite Kylo, but I’m the one he trusts.” “You’re here for Aura,” he said flatly. Tiijian cackled, “I’m here to help you, like any good comrade would do.” Standing up she set a hand on her hip and twirled her hair out her finger with the other hand, “I will observe you both, and if you’ve made adequate progress, I’ll be on my way.” Narrowing her eyes, she stepped towards him, her tall heels clicking as she walked. Her hips sway with each step and she came to a stop in front of him. Her sharp nails walked across his chest and she licked her bottom lip as she stared up at him, “But if you’re struggling, like all beginners do, then I will assist you in her training.” Notes: Finally figured out how I was going to get Aura out of that fighting room lol. Here's a pic of what I think Tiijian looks like: Chapter 11 : Not a real new chapter... Sorry but still read! SOOOOO, I'm rewriting this fic. I know most of ya'll have read alot of this already, but I am in the process of rewriting and it needs a lot of work. I'm posting it as a new story, because it's basically going to be a new one by the time I'm finished. It will use some of these scenes but the overall plot is different. We're talking completely different. If you want to subscribe to the other fic you can find it on my page as Descent into Darkness (rewrite). Thanks so much! I'll delete this fic once I'm through editing.
