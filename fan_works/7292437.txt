Phasma glanced up when Gil returned. The stormtrooper looked disappointed. “Oh, you took off your armour yourself. Huh.” “Yes,” Phasma accepted a synthsust pouch and opened it. “Thanks for this. Unamo has gone to think things over.” Gil nodded. “Remember how nervous I was first time, when you explained what your special mission was? I swear I thought you were going to have me reconditioned afterwards.” “Why would I do that?” Phasma frowned then grinned. “I wanted you to remember and ask for more. Or had you done something insubordinate that I didn’t know about?” “No!” Gil laughed. “I’d’ve told you by now. You ask so very nicely.” Phasma sat back with her feet up. “Do you want to play interrogate the captured rebel scum tonight?” “Sure,” Gil nudged Phasma to move over and sat beside her. “Can I be the rebel scum this time?” Notes: With thanks to Jathis for the name of the game, although in a slightly different context!
