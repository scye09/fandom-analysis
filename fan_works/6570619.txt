I got into mechanics because that’s how you survive out here—plus, I’ve always had the rather useful habit of absorbing data. I know stories of Jedi, wrote them down, especially the ones with strong women in them. They never took no for an answer, even when the men around them—because the world is, whether I like it or not, dominated by them—pushed them to the emotional breaking point. Darth Revan, a legend and a woman with an iron will, usurped Malak, her apprentice. “No,” one of the traders on Jakku will say, “Revan was a man.” “That was four thousand years ago! Is Darth Revan going to appear and put food in our starving bellies? I don’t think so! Rey, my child—” “I’m not your child,” I interrupt the elderly woman and quietly head for home. I carry the staff because it’s the only weapon that will do me any good out here. There’s my intellect and these long, epic stories I act out with my (handmade) pilot doll, but no one cares about any of that, not really. Connecting with anyone other than myself, really, is terrifying; hence, the staff. They see the staff and no one would dare lay a hand on me. No one gets close to me without my consent. No one. Once people get inside you they break you and I sure as hell don’t want to be a broken, bloody victim. Sometimes the nights are so bad that I curl up by myself, in my loneliness, and cry…but in the heat of the day I am a scavenger with a staff and no one can hurt me.
