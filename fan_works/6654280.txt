The sky is dark, two blood moons hanging in the sky overhead. Smoke wafts through the air, stifling his senses. Bodies, young and old litter the ground, surrounding him in a giant circle as rain pours down on them, muddying the plain. The others, all seven of them, heft their weapons and take in their handy work, congratulating one another with silent nods of approval. Lights cut through the smoke and rain and he marches forward his red lightsaber hissing as rain meets the plasma. His eyes are focused on the x-wing as it touches down on the Academy’s landing platform. The other knights begin to follow him, but he holds his hand out to the side, closing it into a fist, “Skywalker is mine.” The group halts and watches as he disappears into the smoke. Water and blood soaked mud sloshes around his boots as he moves closer and closer to the landing pad. He tilts his head to the side as shots of pain burst in the Force, coming from one person, one man. Slowly he begins to see the old man, crouched down inside the hanger, his hand resting on the chest of a lifeless padawan. He flourishes his sword and the sound attracts the man’s attention. Slowly Skywalker stands and turns around, his grey hood falling back. His face is marred with pain. “Ben…” Reaching up he presses the latch on the side of his helmet and it opens with a hiss. Lifting it off his face he sneers and throws it to the side, “My name,” he enunciates, “Is Kylo Ren.” Luke shakes his head, “Why? Why did you kill them?” “They were weak, just like their teacher.” “You didn’t need to murder them! They were younglings, many were your friends!” Luke shouts, “If you blame anyone it should have been me--- you should have killed me--- you should have punished me for my mistakes, not them!” he threw his hand to the side and stared at the little girl laying at his feet. Ren begins to pace, the red glow of his sword reflecting like fire in his eyes, “I am going to kill you, this was only the beginning of your pain.” Luke drops his hands, letting his robe slide to the ground. Reaching down he unclips his lightsaber, and activates it, “You will try.” Gritting his teeth, Ren lets out a yell and lunges forward. Silently, Luke does the same. They’re both blurs of red and green light, that seem to explode out when they meet, clashing in the center of the plain. Sparks fly as they strike at one another, repelling each other with the force of their blows. Ren jumps back and shifts on the balls of his feet, before, flourishing his sword. He rears back as Luke moves towards him. Wrapping both hands around the hilt he leaps forward and aims for the center of Luke’s chest, his body poised to stab. Sidestepping, Luke flicks his wrist, their sabers colliding again, pushing Ren’s away from its mark. They stare at one another, panting as they lock together. Luke presses forward, using his weight against the younger man, who bends back, but gives up no ground. “Ben, stop this. The Dark side will not give you what you want.” “You have no idea what I want!” Ren yells and uses a surge of strength to kick Luke back. Stumbling back, the Jedi held up his sword and blocked Ren’s next strike. That was barely enough though, because before he could rise to his feet and face him, five more come down on him, as Ren yells with each blow, “You. Are. Not. My. Master!” Luke grunts under the force of the boy’s barrage and falls with a shout. Spinning around, Ren kicks out knocking the sword from Luke’s hand. With a small hiss it deactivates and flies to the side, clattering across the stone floor of the hanger until it slides to a stop beside a pile of crates. Gasping, Ren points the tip of his sword down at him, stabbing it in the air in front of the fallen man’s face, “I hate you.” Luke stares into the sparking red blade then looks back up at the boy above him, “I know,” Snarling, Ren steps back and holds out his hand, curving his hand as though he is holding and invisible cup and a low hum fills the air. The Force tightens around Luke, and soon an invisible hand it gripping him by the throat, cutting off his airway. Against his will it picks him up and he hangs in the air, choking, as Ren watches him suffocate. Luke looks to the side. Gasping, he holds out his hand, and focuses on his saber. In a burst of light he pulls up, aiming it at Ren’s chest, as a new voice screams to the side. “NO!” The force constricting around his throat releases, and Luke collapses face first onto the floor. Gasping for air he looks up, as Ben runs to the side, and a hooded figure falls to the ground. Slowly, Luke rises to his feet. Blood rushes through his ears and all he can hear are Ben’s cries as he holds a familiar woman in his arms, a gaping, burning hole in the center of her chest. He can’t see her face, but he watches silently as her hand caresses the boy’s cheek, before falling lifelessly onto the floor. “Hannah, look at me, don’t go! No, no, no!” Ben holds her to his chest, rocking her back and forth. The older man crouches down and stares at the two of them sadly, his pain colliding with Ben’s in the Force. Tears streak down the boy’s face and he looks up at Luke, “You killed her!” Luke grits his teeth as he stares at his two fallen students, one dead, the other lost, “You truly are lost if you think I would ever hurt her---.” “NO!” A deep, throbbing hum fills the air and Luke flinches as metal creaks around them, “Ben,” he says looking around them as the hanger shakes. He focuses on the boy again feeling his anger and sorrow. Quickly he stands, and begins to run towards them, “Don’t---!” A crashing sound echoes all around him as the hanger collapses, and soon everything turns to darkness. ******************************************************************************“ Ben!” The sounds of his footsteps resound through the chamber before going silent as he comes to a stop. Slowly he turns around, his hands hanging tensely at his sides. “Han Solo, I’ve been waiting for this day a long time.” He can hear the dissonant echo of his voice outside his helmet. The cameras in the eye sockets of his helm zoom in on the older man’s face, as he takes a few steps out onto the walkway. Solo’s face is pained, as though the sheer sight of the man before him, is stabbing him through the heart. Holding out his hand he points to Ren’s face, “Take off that mask. You don’t need it.” Standing stock still, Ren chuckles softly, “What do you think you’ll see if I do?” Solo grimaces and yells through gritting teeth, “The face of my son.” They stare one another down, and Ren almost refuses to give in, then he sees movement behind the other man, white armored troopers falling into position to take aim. He looks back at Han. The exit a few levels above them opened and two figures ran inside. The draining sunlight acts as a spotlight, shining on Han’s silver hair, and reflecting in the dark Jedi’s eyes. Slowly, and deliberately he lifts his hands letting his fingers press against the bottom of his helm. His hair blows in the wind as he holds it in his right hand. With determined steps the smuggler draws closer. “Your son is gone,” he says, through clenched teeth, “He was weak and foolish, like his father, so I destroyed him.” His words echo through the cavern and he juts out his chin. “That’s what Snoke wants you to believe, but it’s not true. My son is alive.” Ren narrows his eyes, “No,” he murmurs quietly, “The Supreme Leader is wise.” Deep down, there’s a sliver of him that truly wants to believe that. “Snoke is using you for your power. When he has what he wants he’ll crush you--- you know it’s true.” Kylo hesitates. He looks down at his hands, and realizes what he’s about to do, “It’s too late.” Han takes a few more steps closing the space between them, “No it’s not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you.” Kylo Ren looks up and stares at him, as his hands begin to shake. Tears prick at the corners of his dark brown eyes. “I’m being torn apart,” he whispers. His bottom lips trembles and his face looks almost deathly pale against his long dark hair and his voice breaks despite himself, “I want to be free of this pain… I know what I have to do, but I don’t have the strength to do it.” He sniffs and clears his throat, as he looks his father in the eye, “Will you help me?” Han steps closer and nods, his face full of love and concern, “Anything.” Slowly he lowers his eyes and takes a deep breath. The thud of Ren’s helm falling to the ground echoes throughout the room. Looking down he reaches back and unclips the lightsaber from his belt and brings it forward, holding it in his hands. Together they stare down at it as the room goes dark. Ben looks up at the door, the last rays of light being pulled away from the planet’s sun. As the light from above fades, so does the light within his soul. With a screeching hiss and clenched teeth, he jerks forward, aiming the end of the hilt towards the center of the man’s chest, and red light explodes between them. Pain, shock, and sorrow flash in Han’s eyes, Ren pushes the blade in deeper, “Thank you.” Jerking back he pulls the saber from his father’s chest and deactivates it, glancing down for a second before looking back up to watch the life drain from the man’s eyes. He doesn’t expect Han to cup his cheek, and for a second, every moment of his old life runs through his mind. Then in almost utter silence, Han falls, and Ren breathes quickly as everything begins to change. ****************************************************************************** The cantina was disgusting. Seedy music for seedy people filled the air, as the masked stranger walked through the crowds. He was dressed in long tan over garments, his mask protruding outwards from the center of his face, like a breather mask. A black belt cinched itself around his waist, his side holster empty. He showed no skin, even his hands were covered in black gloves. Slowly he scanned the room taking in the bar’s regulars as they watched him. The way he walked, straight backed and almost delicately, betrayed the clothing meant to keep him unnoticed as he walked over the dance floor. Aliens of various species mingled together bobbing and grinding against one another in a pulsing rhythmic dance. He passed them by. His eyes, hidden behind black optical filters were focused on the bar at the back of the room, settling on his mark. The man watching him had seen him long before he had even made it down the entrances steps. Stepping around a group of strippers waiting their turn to get drinks from the bar. Standing off to the side, he watched as a bald, scar covered man motioned him over with a flick of his wrist. He was mottled and marred with what looked like burn scars. Really, he looked like he’d been chewed up by a Sarlacc and spat out again a few months later. The man watched him as he drew closer, one dead gray eye staring into space. The stranger stopped and leaned against the bar, “Fett,” he murmured, the voice box within his helmet distorting his voice, making it graveled and deep. “You got two minutes,” the bounty hunter said, a distinct accent lilting the end of each syllable. “I want you to find someone for me.” The Mandalorian glared at him, “Everyone wants me to find someone. What makes you such a special case, Di’Kut ?” The masked man shrugged, “I’ll pay more than they will.” Fett shook his head, and took a sip of his blood red drink. “What’s the catch?” “Take me with you.” Boba Fett reached down and picked up his helmet, “Find someone else. I work alone,” Turning around he put on the helmet and started to leave, when a black gloved hand caught him. Turning around he grabbed the man’s arm and hefted him around, intending to throw him to the ground. Like lightning, the man twisted and dropped down, tugging down. Countering, the bounty hunter rolled over the stranger’s back and moved away, pointing his blaster at the man’s head. The crowd around them moved back, but went about their business, as though this was a normal occurrence. Slowly, the man rose to his feet and held up his hands, “I’ll pay double.” Fett stared at him for a moment before holstering his gun, “You must want this person badly. Who is it?” “Agree to the terms and I’ll tell you.” “You came to me---.” Crossing his arms the stranger shook his head, “It’ll be worth your time. I pay double, you bring me along. Take it or leave it.” They were silent for a moment before Fett leaned against the bar behind him, “Who are you?” “People call me Katona.” Straightening up, he shrugged, “Do we have deal?” The bounty hunter’s shoulders shook slightly, and Katona shifted on the balls of his feet impatiently. Taking a step forward, the Mandalorian held out his hand, “Deal.” Quickly they shook hands then stepped away from one another. Fett crossed his arms and nodded his head, “Who are we going after?” Katona glanced to the side then turned back around, “Kylo Ren.” Boba answers immediately, “No.” “You said we had a deal.” “That was before you told me your kriffin’ target,” Fett spat, “I don’t hunt Jedi, not anymore.” Katona looked down and shook his head, “Triple,” he croaked, “I’ll pay triple.” Fett shook his head, “No one short of royalty has that kind of money---.” “I do,” the other man says tossing him a data pad, “That’s all I have,” Katona says nodding to the holo screen. Looking down, Fett stares at it silently. Switching it off he sets it on the bar, “You want him that bad?” “Yes.” “Why?” Fett cocked his head as Katona’s hands molded themselves into fists, “That’s irrelevant. Will you help me?” "Fine." The old hunter sighed, and stepped past Katona motioning for the man to follow him out of the cantina, “So we’re hunting Jedi? Not like that’s ever gone wrong before.” Chapter 2 Boba Fett watched as Katona sat down in the copilot’s chair of the bounty hunter’s ship and shook his head, “One whole month and I still don’t know what you look like under there.” Katona shrugged and switched on the engines and they moved to an upright position, “I’m not much to look at.” “Same here,” Fett said with a dark laugh. “Yeah, but at least I’m not burnt butt ugly,” Katona jibed back. The Mandalorian laughed as they took off. They weren’t close, but they had definitely moved past the awkward stage of working together. Katona stayed out of his way, and Fett, though reluctantly took him to meet with informants. Resting his head against the back of the chair, Katona watched Fett for a moment before asking, “So? What did your contact have to say?” Fett stared at the viewer screens in front of him, “We’re not the only ones looking for the Jedi---.” “Not a Jedi,” Katona reminded him. Fett rolled his eyes. The man always seemed to take offense whenever he referred to Ren as a Jedi. “ Fine . We’re not the only ones looking for the dark Force-adept.” Katona gave a stiff nod as though he already knew that, “The Resistance wants him too. Leia Organa is his mother. The Jedi Master Skywalker is his uncle, and Han Solo was his father,” the man murmured at the end. “I hear the Jedi returned from exile though a few months ago. If anyone is searching Ren out, it will be him.” Fett shook his head, “That family has all the problems.” “Yeah…” Impatiently, Katona adjusted his gloves, “I don’t suppose the snitch told you where we can find him?” “And if I tell you?” Boba muttered, “Who’s to say you won’t just run off without paying me?” “That really is all you care about, isn’t it?” Katona hissed in disbelief. He threw his hands towards the console, “You’ve drug me around this system chasing one lead after the other, you really think I’m going to leave now?” Fett stared at him impassively. For a moment Katona was silent, before reaching to the side and pulling out a data pad, giving in to Fett’s silent treatment, “Half now, the other half on delivery?” he asked, opening up his account. Fett nodded, and watched as the masked man, typed something in a beep echoed in the cockpit, “Done,” Katona murmured, putting the data pad away and turning to face Fett, “Where is he?” “You aren’t going to believe me.” “Try me.” “An old Empire base in the Outer Rim. Used to belong to Darth Vader.” Shaking his head, Katona crossed his arms, “I actually believe you.” “That’s a first,” Fett replied. Turning to the side, Katona typed something into the transmitter, “Coordinates?” The bounty hunter narrowed his eyes, “Q-Six.” A few seconds later a beep pinged through the cockpit, and Katona took the controls. “You’re just giving it away?” Staring straight ahead, Katona answered quietly, “You said it yourself. Hunting Jedi is nothing but indigestion and getting your ass handed to you.” Slowly the man turned and stared at Boba, “So let’s let the Jedi do the work for us.” Boba frowned and leaned back in his chair seeing where this was going, “Skywalker---.” “Will leap at the chance to get Ben back. I’d much rather catch them both unawares then have to deal with them one-on-one.” He turned back and stared at the screens in front of him, ignoring the bounty hunter’s curious stare. “Who’s Ben?” Katona flinched beneath his helmet, his shoulders jerking as he turned to the side, “Ren. I said Ren.” Unable to see the man’s face Boba shrugged and shifted in his chair. “You seem to have this planned out pretty well.” “I’ve had a while,” Katona muttered as they made the jump to hyperspace, “Stewing is my specialty.” ****************************************************************************** An ugly green haze enveloped the planet as they waited on one of its moons. In the cargo hold of Slave II, Katona glanced around before pulling out a rations packet. With a hiss, he unfastened his helmet and lifted it just enough to reveal his mouth, perfect plump lips and smooth alabaster skin. Quickly he devoured the packet and fastened his helmet again, hearing Boba marching down the steps to find him. “You’re Jedi is late.” Throwing the empty packet of food aside Katona leaned against the wall, “He’s not my Jedi. I sent the coordinates, now all we have to do is see if he takes the bait.” Fett grit his teeth, “This is why I work alone. What if he doesn’t take the bait?” “Then we do it your way. Blast them to bits with that pretty blaster of yours. If we do it my way though, we each stand a better chance of making it out alive.” Walking over to the holo table, Katona waved his hand and a green holographic image of a large fortress hovered in the air, “We’ll enter through here,” he says pointing to the base of the castle, “The garbage shoot is the only way in without going through the guards. We’ll have to be fast too, the rain will eat away at our shields and armor before we even reach the main shaft if we’re not careful.” Katona held up his hand and rotated the view of the fortress, “When we passed by in orbit, I scanned the area. Here,” he said pointing to the back of the castle, “Is where the guard’s presence is weakest. Ren will be somewhere here.” “Why do you think that?” Katona’s shoulders heaved as he sighed, the sound muffled by his helmet, “Gut feeling.” Boba walked around the table staring at the castle, “How do you plan to get him out? He won’t go quietly, and his powers will make it difficult to transport him.” Looking down, Katona reached into a pouch on his belt, pulling out a shining metal dart with a small vial attached to the end, light blue liquid sloshing within it. Holding his hand out, he slid it across the table. Boba caught it and held it up to the light, “This is Mandalorian… old Mandalorian. Where the phwoar did you get this?” The other man shrugged and crossed his arms, “I have my own contacts. Can you use it?” Fett set the dart aside and nodded his head, “Yes. It’ll knock him out for days.” “Good,” Katona murmured, deactivating the table, “Then while Skywalker distracts him, shoot him with that. It should take care of any problems he might give us.” “And Skywalker?” “I’ll handle him,” Katona seethed, turning and staring out the cargo observation window. *************************************************************************** Phasma marched through the halls of Bast Castle, refusing to stop as Stormtroopers stepped aside and saluted her as she went. A set of great black doors slid open ahead of her and she walked into the meditation room. It was dark and bare except for black mats that were laid out of the floor. A black robed figure knelt in the center of the room. “Sir. Our censors show an unidentified ship inbound. Our scans show it to be a YT-1300 light freighter.” The dark Jedi stood slowly, “Allow them to land. I want the ship seized and its passengers captured….” His voice was dark and hoarse, “ Alive ,” he added. With a silent salute the Captain marched out of the room. Kylo Ren held up his hand and waved it to the side. The shutters on the walls hissed and opened revealing the dead, rocky expanse of Vijjun. A ship soared on the horizon and Ren crossed his arms, “I’ve been waiting a long time for this, Skywalker.” *************************************************************************** Blaster fire sounded over their heads as Katona ran along the rock face. Fett used his jetpack to fly ahead of him, staying out of the acid rain as much as he could. Hefting his blaster Katona met up with him by the doors to the garbage shoot. “Whoo! And I thought you smelled bad,” the smaller man coughed, his words were ragged and distorted through his voice box. Fett ignored him and moved inside. The further within they ventured the worse the stench became. Stopping in the center of the cavern they looked up, the trash shoot above them slimy and full of bits of rotting refuse. Fett glanced at Katona, “This is where I leave you,” he said bending his knees preparing to take off. Katona shook his head, and clipped something to the end of his gun. “You Mandalorians and your jetpacks,” he said derisively. Aiming up the shoot he fired, a hook and Verpine cord flying up to latch itself to the top of the shaft. “Some of us don’t need rockets on our back to get around. The bounty hunter grunted and bent his knees, his jetpack firing. He hovered off the ground for a few minutes, “Have fun with that.” Looking up he disappeared inside the shaft. Shaking his head, Katona clipped the end of the cord to his belt and strapped his blaster over his shoulder. With a sigh he followed after the bounty hunter. ****************************************************************************** Ren stood in the center of room, as Skywalker made his way down the steps, throwing troopers against the wall as they tried to stop him. He refused to give it. The Jedi master came to a stop at the bottom of the stairs. Above them on the catwalks, several snipers took aim, waiting for their leader’s signal. Reaching up, the young man pushed back his hood revealing a long ragged scar that traveled from his hairline, across his nose and right cheek, before disappearing beneath the high collar of the tunic beneath his robes. Ren sneered as Luke gripped his green lightsaber, “You should not have come here.” Luke, greyer and much more haggard shook his head, “I turned my back on you once and let you go. I will not do it again, Ben.” “I am stronger than the last time we met.” “So I hear. Tell me, how does someone so powerful manage to be defeated by a young force adept with no training?” Ren narrowed his eyes, “The girl found you.” “She is strong,” Luke admitted, “But if the dark side is as powerful as you claim it to be, you should have destroyed her with little effort. Ten years wandering the galaxy, being crushed beneath Snoke’s feet has taught you nothing.” ****************************************************************************** Katona stepped behind his target as Fett broke the neck of his own across the catwalk. Silently, the masked man lifted his hand, a sharp vibro-dagger in his hand and stabbed the troop, between the plates of his armor. The sound of lightsabers clashing below drew his attention once the catwalk was cleared. Crouching down he looked across the room as Fett took aim. ****************************************************************************** Going down to one knee, Ren spun, kicking out at Luke’s feet, sweeping the man’s legs out from beneath them. Panting, the young man wiped his face and stood, as Luke scrambled back, “It’s--!” A small pop sounded above him and something sharp pricked his neck. Gasping, he reached up, pulling a silver dart from his neck. Turning around he looked up, the snipers gone, the barrel of a gun pointing at him. Then the dizziness began. Gulping for air he fell to his knees, as his vision blurred, and sounds melded together in a roaring wave that threatened to deafen him forever. Luke stood behind him, as he collapsed onto the floor and moved towards him, the room going silent, “Ben?” A small thud sounded behind him and he turned around a masked figure staring at him, “You?” A soft pitch hum exploded as Katona threw up his hand, using the force to throw the Jedi into the air. Closing his hand into a fist, he brought it down, slamming Luke into the floor, picking him up again, and sending him flying across the room. Unconcsious, the man slid to the floor. Slowly, Katona approached Ren’s unconscious body as Fett flew down to meet him, “I knew there was more to you than that mask,” the Mandalorian spat, “You paid triple when you could have done this yourself?” Katona shrugged, as he nudged Ren with his foot. Slowly he reached up, and unlocked his helmet. Long brown hair fell out from underneath it and Fett straightened up in surprise. A woman, no older than thirty raised a dark eyebrow and ran her fingers through her hair. Her skin was pale and smooth. “I thought you’d be more useful,” the woman said with a devilish smirk. Her voice was higher and smoother without the voice box to mask her words. She tossed her helmet aside. Quietly she looked down at Ren, her blue eyes darkening in the light. Voices swirled around her in the Force, and she did her best to not get lost in them. She needed to focus. Fett moved around her impatiently, “So we’re done now?” “Not yet,” she said snapping her gaze to stare up at the bounty hunter, “There’s one more thing I need from you. Then you’ll get your money.” “Who’re you really?” Standing up she lifted her hands, Ren’s body rising into the air, “I’m no one.” Chapter 3 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) He could not move. Waking with a start he tried to move his arms, only to find that they were subdued in metal shackles. His legs were in the same predicament, and metal bars wrapped around his torso, keeping him from moving at all. Then the pain started. It was sharp like a blunt needle was burying itself in his temple, racing across his skull and coming out the other side. His vision was split, and he gasped as he tried to breathe. The room was dark and bare, with low ceilings and yellow lights hanging overhead. A voice hissed across the room and he turned towards it as best he could, two mirror images sat with their backs to him. Shaking his head, his split vision disappeared and the two figures melded into one. It was hard to see in the light, but he made out the silhouette of a woman. She was wrapping something around her torso slowly, obviously in pain. “Damn bounty hunters,” she hissed. Turning her head to the side she shook her head, and spoke to the air, “It’s not my fault your son is the last Jedi in the galaxy.” Ren stared at her as she talked to herself, sure that she was insane. “My money wasn’t enough. No ! Fett had to go and try to sell Luke to the First Order.” He tilted his head. Her voice sounded familiar, but her presence in the Force was… distorted. It was as though she was broken into a million shards of glass, the pieces barely holding themselves together. With a groan she stood up and pulled on a tunic. “Who are you?” Ren hissed, trying to get out of his restraints. She spun around, “You’re awake.” Slowly she came into the light, blue eyes staring at him sadly, “It’s been a long time.” He let out a stuttering breath, “You-you’re not real.” The woman stepped closer and reached up pulling the collar of her shirt down revealing her chest and a large circular scar at its center. His gaze snapped up as she readjusted her shirt, “You’re supposed to be dead. Hannah---.” “Do I look dead to you?” she asked, stepping back and leaning against a column. Ren lurched in his restraints and hissed as pain shot through his left forearm. He looked down to find a white bandage wrapped around his arm. Hannah watched him quietly, “I took out the tracker. They won’t find you.” Ren shook his head, “Why?” he stared at her, “How?” “The how is easy to answer, the why will take… some time.” With a sigh she slid to the floor and clasped her hands, “I’ve spent the past ten years waiting, biding my time---.” “For revenge?” he asked. Hannah waved her hand dismissively, “That’s what you’d like me to say wouldn’t you? It’s easier to say everyone is against you, makes you feel stronger, makes it easier to kill innocent people when they call you a monster.” With a sigh she wrapped her hand around her side with a wince, “You remember my family? You met my uncle when we went on that diplomacy mission to Hosnian Prime.” “I remember,” he growled. “They’re dead now. They died when you destroyed the Republic.” “I gave no orders---.” “But you supported them! You are just as responsible for those deaths as you would be if you had held a blaster to their heads,” she breathed her eyed brimming with sorrow. “I tried to save you and you killed them,” she whispered, “So maybe, in a way, I’m the one who’s really responsible.” “If you feel so guilty about it--- why did you save me? You could have let me die, then none of this would have happened,” he pressed. “Hindsight is twenty-twenty, isn’t it?” she murmured grimly. Ren glared down at her, “Is this why you brought me here?” he spat, “To cry about your pathetic family? They were nothing. You were nothing.” She stared up at him impassively. He panted as he fought to break free but nothing happened. He focused on Hannah’s eyes and how they seemed to almost look through him. “I told you this was a bad idea.” Ren scowled, “What are you---?” Hannah held her hand up in annoyance as though he was a child, “Shhhh.” She looked to the side as though someone was talking to her, “Well it’s fine when you say it. He won’t listen to me.” She shook her head as she listened to invisible, silent people that Kylo couldn’t see. “You’re insane,” he murmured. Hannah looked back at him and chuckled. “If only it were that easy.” Rubbing her temples she closed her eyes and sighed, “I would give anything to just be insane, but I’m not. As C-3PO would say, my cognitive faculties are functioning perfectly.” “Then who are you talking to? There’s no one there.” Hannah’s mouth pulled down into a frown, “That’s a story for later.” With a groan she stood up and held her hand towards him, her long, thin fingers outstretched. A small click echoed through the room, and the shackles on his arms and feet gave way. With a grunt he fell forward. “Like it or not, Kylo Ren, you aren’t leaving this planet until you see the truth.” She spat his moniker like it was a foul taste in her mouth. Brown eyes glared up at her, and with a yell he lunged for her throat. Leaping back, Hannah threw her hands in front of her, pushing him back with an incredible might, one he had not faced since his fight with Skywalker. The air was knocked from his lungs as he crashed into the wall behind him, and she used the Force to keep him pinned. No matter how hard he tried he could not move so he focused on her. She was like a bright flame in the Force, exploding before him, but still calm. Shaking her head, Hannah released him and he fell to his knees gasping for breath. “You aren’t the only one who’s been training all these years.” He leaned on his hands and choked, “Why didn’t you let him kill me? What do you want from me?!” Red faced and out of breath he stared up at her as he sat back on his knees, “I don’t want anything from you.” “I’ll pay you,” he said, “I’ll give you anything you want.” “I spent a fortune just trying to catch you. You really think I care about credits?” Hannah turned her back on him, “I’ll bring some rations later.” She waved her hand in front of the opposite wall and a bed slid out. Silently she walked to the door opening it with another wave of her fingers. Before stepping over the threshold she stopped and looked over her shoulder at him, “I don’t want to do this, Ben. I woke up buried alive, beneath steel and dirt with this scar on my chest. I was alone on that planet for weeks , scavenging food and spare parts to rebuild one of the x-wings.” She shook her head, and set her teeth, “I wish I had died, Ben, I wish I didn’t have to see you like this. I’d rather be dead than be here right now.” He stared at her until she looked away and disappeared through the doors, leaving him in complete isolation. ****************************************************************************** “ You should have told him ,” Anakin said disapprovingly as Hannah set her pile of rations on the counter with a fed up sigh. She turned around and shook her head, “Yes, telling him I can commune with the spirit of our grandparents would really instill his faith in me.” Obi-wan, white haired and aged, stood next to the other apparition, “ Well, when you say it like that.” The Force ghosts disappeared in cloud of blue mist as she waved her hand through his body.
