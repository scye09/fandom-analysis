TAKE ME BACK TO YESTERDAY. Han, so much has happened to us in our lives together. You took me so many places…you took me out of the holding cell, took me to safety..to the place where I could continue to help The Rebellion…Took me away from Hoth, took me to Endor where our love bloomed and took us both on a new adventure of mind, body and spirit. You took me for your bride and took pride in the conception, birth and raising of our son. You took a chance in my world…and gave it all you had, but, it took something from you..the essence of you were …So… that life took you back, but I understood. Those places you took me were a time of joy, sorrow, strife, trial, ecstasy and hope. But, I wish you could take me to one more place, Han…back to yesterday…when you were still alive.
