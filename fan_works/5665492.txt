I mprove your quality of life by reading Life Sentence, No Cellmate by hollycomb . I may have gone a bit overboard with this but I couldn't help myself. Also, I don't usually draw this "realistic", but it'll have to do until I get familiar enough with the characters to make them stylized. Anatomy all over the place etc. :C
