Hux wakes with a start, his neck hurting from sleeping in the chair. Did something wake him? Ren? He looks over and finds him in what seems to be some sort of nightmare. He sounds distressed and keeps thrashing around in his bed. Hux hurries over, like its completely natural for him to rush to Ren’s side when he’s distressed. Fool . He carefully climbs into the bed, but getting a hold of Ren is not easy. When he finally does he holds on tight until he stops moving, whispering in his ear “sshh, calm down, it’s not real, Ren”. He wakes up slightly, enough to turn around and face Hux, and presses into the embrace, face against Hux’s chest, where he can probably feel how fast and hard Hux’s heart is beating. Ridiculous . Ren smiles against his chest. “What are you doing?” he says, Hux can hear the mocking tone of his voice. Great . “Hell if I know, but since you’re awake I think I should probably go”. Please don’t make me go . “No!” Kylo says a little too fast, not meaning to sound desperate. “Please stay, don’t move.” Please . Not a word he tends to use, not a word he likes to use. And yet he doesn’t mind right now, as long and Hux doesn’t move away from him. It’s been a long time since he woke up already calm after the nightmare, and apparently Hux did that. Damn it . They stay like this, neither moving, neither wanting to, not saying anything. Kylo keeps his face against Hux’s chest, listening to his heartbeat, the heat of Hux’s body transferring to Kylo’s, no space at all between them. He feels Hux’s hand going into his hair, sending chills down his spine. It’s almost enough to make him hard, but he restrains himself, not wanting this moment to change, not now. Kylo falls asleep again like this, pressed close to Hux's body and touch. He can’t remember the last time he slept so peacefully.
