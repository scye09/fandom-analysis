"We aren't letting you leave until you tell us happened Y/N." Ben says, staring Y/N deep into their E/C eyes. Y/N sighs. "I guess I got a little too cocky in my training today. Some stormtrooper thought it would be okay to throw me around a bit. I'm okay though, I promise." They reach over a hand and place it on top of Ben's. Kylo stands up and paces. "They should know that they can't hurt you like that and live." Y/N stiffens. "Kylo, I promise I'm fine. It hurts but I-" "No! You're ribs are bruised, and your face is bruised. That's not fine at all! No one can lay a hand on you, Y/N. No one." Kylo interrupts. He then storms out. Y/N lets out a pained sigh and runs their hands down their face. Ben looks at Y/N with kind eyes. "He'll come around. He always does. We love you Y/N, and I hate seeing you hurt as well." Y/N looks up and smiles gently. "Thanks Ben. I'm sorry." He shakes his head. "Don't apologize. But can you promise me-promise us-that you'll be more careful?" Y/N nods. "I can do that." Notes: the-imagines-awaken.tumblr.com (requests are open) theaidenellis.tumblr.com
