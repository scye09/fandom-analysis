Trip "I thought you were dead." Hux's voice was a whisper, his eyes wide as he stared at Kylo. He half believed that maybe this was not the Knight but a hallucination, a dream. It had to be, right? He'd seen Kylo die, in the battle, shot to the ground, his body unmoving. As far as he knew, the Resistance had claimed the body, as they had had to make a retreat, and Phasma dragged him away before he could try and retrieve the knight's limp corpse. They'd left the planet and had been unable to return. That was months ago. So how was the man standing in front of him? Kylo looked nervous. "I'm real, not- I'm not a hallucination. You still think really loudly." "You were shot ." He wasn't convinced. That sounded exactly like what a hallucination would say. "I've taken worse. Starkiller, remember? This wasn't as bad." "You fell to the ground!" The Knight suddenly looked embarrassed. "The...the force of the impact made me lose my footing, there were sticks everywhere, you know? And...I fell and hit my head on the ground, which knocked me out." Okay, this definitely wasn't a hallucination. Hux knew his subconscious couldn't come up with such a ridiculous explanation. "You...that's so stupid." "Hey!" "I have been grieving over you for months , all because you tripped and hit your head! Kriff, Ren, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!" Hux felt a little hysterical. "Stars, Ren, you-" He laughed. "What an idiot!" Kylo's face went red. Hux's laughing gradually became hysteric and Kylo reluctantly wrapped his arms around the ginger and patted his back to try and calm him down a tad.
