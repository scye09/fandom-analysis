Title: Satisfied Fandom: Star Wars Characters: Maz Kanata/Chewbacca Word Count: 100 Rating: PG-13 A/N: AU after the events of Star Wars: The Force Awakens Warnings: n/a Summary: She's finally done what she promised ages ago. Maz's fingers comb through the thick hair on Chewbacca's chest. The Wookie is snoring with a look of complete bliss on his face. For now, he is at peace. The things he's seen, the things he's done, have faded away. With a content sigh, Maz shifts until her head rests on Chewbacca's shoulder. She's sore in all the right places (the mark on her neck will take days to fade) and has finally done what she'd promised ages ago- she climbed him like a wroshyr tree. As she starts to drift off, her last thought is, 'Chewbacca, what a Wookie'.
