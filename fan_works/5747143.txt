He lost the battle however when Finn started to laugh, snickering as he shook his head. “Imperial…scum…” “Hey!” Finn pointed a finger in Poe’s face and the pair burst into a fit of giggles. “Don’t you…laugh at me!” Poe threw his head back, unable to help himself as he easily slipped free from his bonds, shaking his head. “Finn! You are the worst interrogator in the whole collection of galaxies!” “Well you’re the worst prisoner!” Finn countered. Poe snorted, grabbing Finn by the middle and pulling him into his lap. “I think I can live with that.”
