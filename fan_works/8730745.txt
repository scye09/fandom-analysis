Okay, there’s seriously some regs Poe can invoke about this. Kylo has new pants, and Poe is sure everyone in the room has to notice, right? So Poe might be a bit closer to level with said ass, but there’s other people who aren’t Kylo’s ridiculous height. And who must notice the Buns of Perfection wandering past them. Or - you know - when he bends. Like to point at things. Or. Uhm. Poe forces his eyes anywhere else, and accidentally ends up staring at Kylo’s mother’s stomach. Which is an odd disconnect, and his attention drifts guiltily upwards. Normally he’s the model of dignified, but right now he just– The pants are so tight . They leave nothing to the imagination. Not that Poe needs to imagine, as he knows precisely which side Kylo dresses to, and what his cock and balls and ass and everything look like. It’s just that Kylo is - is - he’s really flaunting his assets (no pun intended), and when he fusses his thumbs into his belt, it does everything to accentuate his - uh - the seam between his thighs and the flare of his… “Commander?” Shit fuck crap kriff balls dick ass– what? “Did you have an opinion?” Poe stares at Kylo, loudly thinking now is the time to remind me what I think, Butt-Boy . Kylo does not. “I think… I need to consider the dossier some more,” he blags. Leia Organa chooses not to ridicule him further, but she’s clearly half-wry, half-disappointed. Poe hates to let her down like this, but her son is to blame. Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 72 of the The Pilot and his Knight series Next Work →
