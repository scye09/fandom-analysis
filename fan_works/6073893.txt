Finn and Poe keep making eyes at each other. Shoulders bumping. Pinky fingers lacing together. "You're awesome." "No, you're awesome." "You're perfect." "No, you are." Their exchange goes on for a while and to this day Rey doesn't understand how they even get something done, if they spend most of their time praising each other and waiting for the other one to come back safe and sound. "Really you are the best." "And you're amazing." Rey rolls her eyes, looking down at BB-8. They should be on a mission already. "Uh, guys? Do you think you can leave that for another moment? There's a galaxy to save." Series this work belongs to: Part 1 of the Space Dorks In Love series Next Work â†’
