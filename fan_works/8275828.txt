Poe has always admired Ben's unusual talent with plasmas. When they were younger, Ben would amaze Poe by making shapes in campfires. Little things, like plants and starfighters. As the boys grew up, they went their separate ways. Poe trained to become a pilot, Ben a Jedi. They still managed to find time for each other, however. Ben would tease Poe, freezing his blaster bolts and rearranging them to make simple phrases. "Hey, Poe." "Miss me?" "I love you." One day, Ben just disappeared. But when Poe's shot hung in mid-air on Jakku, Poe knew exactly whose hand controlled it.
