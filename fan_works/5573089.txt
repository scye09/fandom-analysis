“Is that what you want?” Hux asks, his voice low and thoughtful as his thumbs dig fingerprint bruises into the sides of Kylo Ren’s hips, his breathing hard in his own ears. “You want that?” He can’t find words to answer the other man, who leans closer, lips brushing Ren’s ear, a semblance of the gentle lover’s touch they have never once shared. “You just want love, don’t you, Ben ,” The name makes something inside him crack, into almost a thousand pieces, and the muffled, choked noise he makes high in this throat causes Hux to laugh, his hips to shift higher and push into Kylo just where it hurts, where it burns, where it sings , and he chokes out, the words bile on his lips, “Daddy, Daddy please ,” and Hux fucks him through it, fucks him until he’s pressing his face into the bedsheets to muffle the incoherent sobbing that balls up in his throat.
