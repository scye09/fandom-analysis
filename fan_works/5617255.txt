Han comes back six days later, looking none the better. Even from the distance, Luke can see he's drunk and he wonders how he's even still alive flying in this state. Again. "Han, this is not the way-" His friend cuts him off in a hoarse voice, a voice designed to hurt. "You wanna tell me how to grieve for my son? You wanna tell me how to live with what he did? Do you?" "Han, don't, he's right," Leia tries feebly and Han's eyes seem to go even darker. "Why do you keep taking his side, Leia? Ben murdered children, under his care! You were supposed to help him, Skywalker!" "Like you'd never let anyone down," she whispers and Han flinches as if she'd slapped him. "He should've had his father to guide him, but he didn't - you weren't - you missed half his birthdays-" "One, I missed one , because I was held captive, I almost died !" "And whose fault was that?!" Luke feels number with every second he watches them. He was counting on their love for each other to get them through it. But Han's helpless rage and Leia's bottomless sadness are already beginning to tear them apart. Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 6 of the Reflections of our Lives series Next Work →
