Meeting the sith lord I infiltrated the sith base where Kylo was present. I searched the entire base until I stumbled upon a hallway that had at least 10 doors on each side. I think I found the barracks. I walked past all of them until I got to the very last door on the right. It had a plaque that said Kylo Ren. It was locked and secured with a keypad. I used my telekinesis to open the door. I entered and closed the door behind me. His room is not what I expected. It had a blue walls with a black trim. His closet was huge and filled with different cloaks and coats. He had a large collection of boots. He had a master bath with a white tub and candles around it. Granite counter tops, tile floors. His decor is almost that of a normal person. The only thing that wasn't normal was his massive king size bed in the middle of the room with black silk sheets. His pillows were a deep navy blue to match his walls. As I stood admiring the bed I heard a booming voice say looking for me darling. I jumped and turned around at the voice. It was the dark lord himself. Kylo ren.
