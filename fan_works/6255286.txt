While watching a Carl’s Jr commercial its basicly the one where the cheif is eating the steak house burger and im like wow he looks like a cool punk version of Hux and I’m like what if kylo Ren was a food critic , and hux was the chief at the resturant called the finallizer and hux is the best there and everyone calls him the genereal because he runs a tight kitchen/restaurant .
