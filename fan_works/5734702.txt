Apartment Hunting PRESENT DAY Dear Diary, R2 and I are going apartment hunting today! I'm quite excited. He's not. But anyway. I've been thinking about this moment ever since we started dating. Well, not really, I hadn't thought about settling down that much at all because I used to be what one would call... a playaaaa. But I've always known I would have a future with R2, that lively little thing. However, I'm not going to deny that I'll miss our adventures with the great Luke Skywalker. Settling down had always been oh so inevitable, but it's just happened so fast! In fact, R2 and I are already talking about starting a family! I'm very curious about that; I would love to be a dad. I'll be Dad and R2 can be Daddy. Although, we may have to find an alternative for R2. On the internet, things are easy to remember but hard to forget. I'll never forget that time I accidentally Googled 'DD/LG'! Anyway, I best be off. R2 is screeching my name and wheeling himself about like a madman! I HAVE A HEADACHE ILL KEEP WRITING THIS TOMORROW OR SOMETHING IF U WANT ACTUAL CONTENT PLEASE READ MY KYLO REN/ JAR JAR BINKS FIC
