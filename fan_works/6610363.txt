Hours before Starkiller Base was destroyed, Kylo Ren sneezed, helmet on. It was gross. Kylo Ren was not one for quiet sneezes, which also caused his voice modulator to make an alarmingly loud screech in the control room, scaring half of the troopers within earshot. This disruption agitated Hux.

Fuck you , Ren thought at Hux, I've seen you pick your nose when you thought nobody was watching . The General’s eyebrow twitched in irritation, and Ren smugly went to go clean the front of his helmet. Now, Hux sat in the medical bay of the Finalizer , Ren hooked up to a number of machines, the quiet breathing of the dark haired man and the slow, steady beeping of the heart rate monitor Hux's only company. As Ren’s sleeping face contorted in pain, a small part of Hux wondered if things would have been different if he had blessed him.
