Kylo looked at himself inside the shards of a mirror, the trickle of blood beginning to dry out already. He was inside the mirror, another version of himself, with messy hair and furious trails raking the skin of his face. One was beading blood, crossing from his left eyebrow down to the right cheek. Lips and hands shook heavily, his breath catching and darting out in sharp whiffs as a shard fell off to the ground with a clink. He never meant for this to happen. His eyes dropped to the floor, ginger hair crumpled beneath a limp body. Swallowing hard he wetted his lips and his eyes flicked back to his self in the mirror. His breath, it hitched. He balled his fists voidly, not clamping on anything, crescents blooding white then red on his palms. He still felt the shape and the throb of Hux's neck,the scream of pain as he connected with the mirror. Then nothing. He leans back to the bathroom wall, the tiles cool on his heated skull. “I didn't mean to.” The blast of a gun explodes through the turquoise tiles, shattered. Blood, blood, blood.
