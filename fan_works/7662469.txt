Rey scoured the galaxy in search for Luke Skywalker. Using the map that was now completed, she managed to find her way to… An insane asylum? Rey knew Luke would go into hiding, but this seems too out of the way, even for a Jedi Master like Luke. “Hello?” She landed the ship and explored the desolate place. She noticed the lack of guards… Though that’s when she tripped over a body. She got up and saw a guard with a very forced smile… That could never go away. “Hello, my… darling.” Rey then saw a smiling green-haired man. Joker.
