Reports were flying fast and furious in the command center as the wireless chatter of her squadron broke through the uneasy atmosphere surrounding her. The Resistance had taken on the responsibility of protecting the New Republic from its own complacency and the growing darkness... They had been planning for this eventuality. However, when the first major surge in the dark side came in the midst of the battle, she was personally unprepared. It burned bright in her consciousness for a moment before being usurped by a brief sensation of mind numbing pain and a familiar hollowness that forced her to turn from her post. He was gone. The man who had been a part of her existence for over half of her life was just... gone. “General? Are you alright?” No. No. NO. A hesitant touch to her arm brought her back to her surroundings in an instant. The world narrowed and sound shattered the space her mind had gone. Blinking rapidly, she quickly looked up into the concerned face of one of the younger members of her command team. “Ma’am?” “Yes?” She said quietly. When had she sat down? She couldn’t remember. “General... Are you –” A crackle of static burst across the airwaves and jolted her into the present. The pilots. The First Order. Coruscant. “Fine. I’m fine.” Han. Standing slowly she turned to look at the readouts and moved back to her previous position. It would have to wait. All of it. Again.
