“Who are you?” “What are you?” They always ask me that…. Who am I? …What am I? Well…. I’m not you. I’m me. It’s simple as that. Only Science chooses to name things and define things. People go with it because humans have to label “everything”. Now I have a question for you…. “What happens when Science doesn’t cover everything and People are left scratching their heads?” What I do and what I am does not define me. I DON’T want anyone to define me.
