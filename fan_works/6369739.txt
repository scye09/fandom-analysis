Kylo didn't even register the shots that went through Y/N's body until they collapsed on the floor. They were both ambushed by a few Resistance fighters. Kylo quickly runs to their side and cups their face in his large, gloved hand. They whimper, and he carries them quickly to a safer place. He holds Y/N in his arms, while trying to stop the bleeding. Being unable to succeed, he lets out a frustrated growl. Y/N's voice starts. "Stop. Kylo p-please." "Don't say that. Don't you fucking leave me, don't you dare." He replies, voice shaking, tears spilling. "You can't make everything listen to you. It's okay." Y/N places a hand on his cheek, Kylo leans into it. "Just a little longer, please. For me." He whispers. He tenses when he feels Y/N's hand go cold and slide down his face. "No, Y/N. Don't do this. Don't leave me here, please. You can't..." He lets the hot tears freely fall from his face, as he leans over his fallen friend in his arms. He places a protective hand around the side of their head as he gives them a kiss on their forehead. He looks up and whispers, "Wait for me." Notes: Star Wars imagine blog: the-imagines-awaken.tumblr.com Personal: theaidenellis.tumblr.com
