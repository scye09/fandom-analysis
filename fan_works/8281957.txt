They’re on Yavin IV, lying on their backs in the dewy tall grass to stare up into the pink-streaked night sky, when Poe points up at a bright cluster of three stars and says, “See that one, up there – just to the left of you, Finn, that’s Timmn Zyrth, or the Temple Fires – see how they line up like candles?” And Rey says: “No, that’s not right – that’s The Eyes of R’iia, we could see it at the very edge of the horizon on Jakku when the sky was clear enough, and it meant that we were all blessed because no sandstorms were coming in for at least a week.” Finn doesn’t have a name for the constellation they’re tracing with their pointing fingers, because the windows of the Star Destroyers were tinted to keep out the view of a wider world than stormtroopers got to have – but he thinks, maybe, that he’ll remember that spot of brightness against the dark sky as Three Lovers.
