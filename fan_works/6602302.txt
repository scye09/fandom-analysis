Rey never realized just how bad her gaydar was. At least, not until she was pressed into the seat of a starfighter, Jessika Pava sitting on her lap as they made out. Jessika's lips were amazingly soft, and she was gentle in her kissing. She'd never had even a single inkling that Jessika was gay, though she didn't know the other woman all too well. This was their first time being together. She'd always kind of known that Finn and Poe were both gay, even before they announced that they were dating. Rey didn't mind having terrible gaydar, since it meant that she was able to have a heated make-out session with Jessika.
