I love Wake Up, Sleeper. I love it so much that I had to try to podfic it. I've never podfic a work before so please tell me if something needs to change and what I can do to improve. Ive only have the first two chapters done but I'll try to get the next one and maybe chapter 4 done tomorrow. Thank you to penpen! Please enjoy! Chapter 1 Chapter 2 EDIT: Here is the download link for the entire story: Wake Up, Sleeper Please enjoy! Chapter 2 Here is Chapters 3 and 4. I'm so sorry for drying machine noises in the background of chapter 4. I'll probably rerecord this chapter and replace it later but I want to get this up today. I hope you enjoy! Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 3 And here are chapters five and six! I hope everyone enjoys them. I'm going to try to get one more done this weekend but I may not because of Mothers day tomorrow. I really only have time on the weekend to record and edit. The next two weeks are kinda busy so I may not get a new recording out next week. But I'll try!
