Poe’s phone was ringing obnoxiously from across his bedroom. He groaned before nudging his corgi off the bed to get up and answer it. “Hello?” He grumbled, still half-asleep. “Poe? Did I wake you?” Poe blinked, looked at the caller ID and then put the phone back up to his ear, “Finn?” “Yeah,” His best friend said, “What colour suit should I wear to prom?” “I… What?” There was silence on the end of the phone before Finn said, “Well, we have to match, so what colour are you wearing?” “Since when are we going to prom together?” Poe asked, thoroughly awake and confused now. “Shit, I forgot to ask you.” Poe was still trying to wrap his mind around the fact that Finn wanted to go to prom with him . “Yo-you were gonna ask me to prom?” “Well...yeah.” He could almost imagine Finn rubbing at the back of his neck like he did when he was nervous. He smiled, “I’ll go to prom with you. Should we meet up to discuss this?” Finn’s relieved laughter came down the phone, which made Poe laugh in response. Notes: They are so freakin’ cute. I can’t help writing it. Kudos and reviews make my day. Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 11 of the Short Poe/Finn Fics. series Next Work →
