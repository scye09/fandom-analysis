Rey looked into his eyes and saw more than just rage. He circled around her with both bloodlust and grace. He’d rather kill her than go down in shameful defeat. Yet, this was all on the surface. Compassion reminded her to look beyond his shroud. Kylo Ren was more than his feared name. Beyond the miasma of his anger, she saw his truth that he no longer saw himself.
