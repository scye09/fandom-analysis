“Ben!” The sounds of his footsteps resound through the chamber before going silent as he comes to a stop. Slowly he turns around, his hands hanging tensely at his sides. “Han Solo, I’ve been waiting for this day a long time.” He can hear the dissonant echo of his voice outside his helmet. The cameras in the eye sockets of his helm zoom in on the older man’s face, as he takes a few steps out onto the walkway. Solo’s face is pained, as though the sheer sight of the man before him, is stabbing him through the heart. Holding out his hand he points to Ren’s face, “Take off that mask. You don’t need it.” Standing stock still, Ren chuckles softly, “What do you think you’ll see if I do?” Solo grimaces and yells through gritting teeth, “The face of my son.” They stare one another down, and Ren almost refuses to give in, then he sees movement behind the other man, white armored troopers falling into position to take aim. He looks back at Han. The exit a few levels above them opened and two figures ran inside. The draining sunlight acts as a spotlight, shining on Han’s silver hair, and reflecting in the dark Jedi’s eyes. Slowly, and deliberately he lifts his hands letting his fingers press against the bottom of his helm. His hair blows in the wind as he holds it in his right hand. With determined steps the smuggler draws closer. “Your son is gone,” he says, through clenched teeth, “He was weak and foolish, like his father, so I destroyed him.” His words echo through the cavern and he juts out his chin. “That’s what Snoke wants you to believe, but it’s not true. My son is alive.” Ren narrows his eyes, “No,” he murmurs quietly, “The Supreme Leader is wise.” Deep down, there’s a sliver of him that truly want to believe that. “Snoke is using you for your power. When he has what he wants he’ll crush you--- you know it’s true.” Kylo hesitates. He looks down at his hands, and realizes what he’s about to do, “It’s too late.” Han takes a few more steps closing the space between them, “No it’s not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you.” Kylo Ren looks up and stares at him, as his hands begin to shake. Tears prick at the corners of his dark brown eyes. “I’m being torn apart,” he whispers. His bottom lips trembles and his face looks almost deathly pale against his long dark hair and his voice breaks despite himself, “I want to be free of this pain… I know what I have to do, but I don’t have the strength to do it.” He sniffs and clears his throat, as he looks his father in the eye, “Will you help me?” Han steps closer and nods, his face full of love and concern, “Anything.” Slowly he lowers his eyes and takes a deep breath. The thud of Ren’s helm falling to the ground echoes throughout the room. Looking down he reaches back and unclips the lightsaber from his belt and brings it forward, holding it in his hands. Together they stare down at it as the room goes dark. Ben looks up at the door, the last rays of light being pulled away from the planet’s sun. A dark voice whispers in the back of his mind, “ Through strength, you gain power. Through power, you gain victory. Through victory, your chains shall be broken.” He looks back up and gives Han’s face one last glance. Then he kills him. ************************************************************************************* “GUAH!!!” he screamed as he sat up in his bed. Sweat dripped down his back, and he stared into the darkness of the room. His chest heaved as he threw back the sheets and set his feet on the floor. He hunched over and covered his mouth, and closed his eyes, only to see the red glare of his sword plunging into… cutting into… He could still feel the last touch of his father's hand cupping his face. With a sigh, he opened his eyes and stood going to the large window on the other side of the room. The soft glow of the planet below illuminated his features, which reflected in the glass. Dark hair, pale skin with a couple moles here and there, a defined and muscled body covered in scars. One over his left ribs, another against his shoulder, a clean cut one across the width of his thigh, but the most conspicuous was the jagged scar that ran from the center of his brow down to the right side of his cheek. Looking to the side he caught a glimpse of the clock. Barely an hour of sleep. Wiping his forehead he made his way over to the shower room, hoping to shake the dreams from his mind. ************************************************************************************ He felt… naked. With no mask to hide his face, he was left open to the stares of those who ranked below him. His hands twitched wanting to pull down his hood, but he refused to give them the satisfaction. Instead, he hardened his expression as he marched behind the guards that were leading him from his room, More like cell , to the throne room on the First Order’s flagship. Standing to the side, the guards opened the door. One of them reached out to shove him inside, but stopped when he saw the animalistic glare in Kylo’s eyes. A thought struck him when he saw the look on the guards face, Terror can come in any form. H e would learn to use his appearance to his advantage. Silently the dark Jedi strode into the chamber. The doors slid shut behind him and he peered through the darkness, finding a large shadow atop a giant throne. Pulling back his hood he knelt in the center of the room. “Master---.” “You seem to fail me at every turn, Kylo Ren,” a dark, gravelly voice echoed through the room, and Ren looked down at the floor as it weighed on him. The voice continued growing louder and angrier with every word, “Tell me, how did my apprentice fail to defeat an untrained child?” Ren flinched at the sound of a fist thudding against the arm of the marble throne. Looking down, he clenched his hands, trying to stop them from shaking. “I was weak. The pain of…” “You failed in your mission, because of pain?! You didn’t use it to find your strength. Have you learned nothing? ” Snoke’s voice thundered, “Now the girl is on her way to Skywalker, if she hasn’t found him already.” Standing up the seven foot something Sith Lord stared down at him, “So tell me, Lord Ren , what do you plan to do?” Kylo snapped his head up and stared at the creature, “I will find them and I will kill them. I will not fail you again.” Snoke narrowed his eyes and bent down, shoving his face in front of Ren’s, “Pray that you do not, or I will teach you the true meaning of pain.” ************************************************************************************ He stared at the screen pictures of FN-2187, the girl, and one that needed no introduction. “Where were these taken?” The lieutenant glanced down at his data pad, “Our spies tagged them as they entered the Hutt’s Daystar Casino.” Crossing his arms, Kylo frowned, as he stared at Skywalker's photo, Why would you go there? Turning around he left the room, issuing one last command. “Have General Hux prepare the fleet. I want them captured alive.” Chapter 2 Rey scanned the crowds as they walked through the casino, “How do you even know if this person you’re looking for is still here?” she murmured. Luke smirked, “She’s here. I can feel it.” Walking up behind them, Finn clapped his hands on their shoulders, “I don’t suppose we have time for a round or two of pazzak?” Rey shook her head and gave him a look of disbelief, “Or not,” he said holding his hands up in surrender. Turning around in circles they took in the decadence of the Huttese casino house. It wasn’t like the extravagant, elegant casinos of Coruscant. This was seedy, and disgusting, with heavy armed thugs at each exit, and slime ball card whales. The prostitutes and whores that walked up and down the aisles made Rey’s skin crawl. “Can we just find this apprentice of yours and get out of here?” she hissed, pulling her robes around her tighter. Luke nodded to a large crowd surrounding a table in the back of the room. Cheers and applause thundered and he started walking towards them. Finn and Rey glanced at one another, before following after him. ************************************************************************************* Alright, let’s get this show on the road, she thought, flipping back her long red curls over her bare shoulder. Her tight leather pants and cut off tank-top left little to the imagination, showing off her alabaster skin for everyone to see. Staring at the Trandoshan across from her she cupped her hands together and shook the contents, her blue eyes glinting with every toss. Then she released them. Three dice flew across the table and she mentally began to count, Five! Three! The last dice spun, and she felt her index finger twitch, as the crowd went silent. Closing her eyes she breathed through her nose and focused on the cube, feeling it as though it was still resting in between her fingers. In her mind she imagined pushing it over to that lucky side that she needed so much. A thundering shout echoed around her and she opened her eyes. Seven… Looking up she smirked across the table, then reached for the chips, “Pleasure doing business with you, Gatt. “ A clawed, green reptilian hand caught her by the wrist, “Uba cheeska!” She cocked her head, and smiled devilishly as security pulled the alien off her, “A cheater? I’d have to be some kind of god for that to work.” Laughing she looked down and collected her chips as the lowlifes surrounding her moved away. With a glare and a hiss Gatt fled from the room. “Or perhaps you just have a penchant for winning in a rigged game?” a voice asked behind her. Her head snapped up, and she twisted around, her left hand reaching for the blaster holstered around her thigh. “Hello, Alana,” Luke murmured with a sad smile. She stared at him, “You.” He nodded and moved closer, “It’s been a long time--- whoa!” Two hands caught him by the collar and he was dragged forward, until she slammed him against the gambling table, “You son of a bitch, you show up now after---.” The cold end of a blaster pressed against the base of her head, “Let him go,” Rey hissed. “Rey, it’s alright,” Luke said holding his hand out to the girl, “Put the gun down.” The girl stared at him before finally lowering the blaster. She stepped back, and stood next to Finn, who was still aiming for Alana’s head. With a snarl the red head stared down at the man beneath her, “What the fuck are you doing here?” “I need your help.” Alana straightened up, “What makes you think I would ever help you?” she spat. “It’s Ben.” She let him go and stepped back. Shaking her head she scoffed, “You have a lot of nerve for an old hermit. I’m busy,” she said picking up her bag and gesturing to the casino, “Go find someone else to pull into you family problems. Force knows, you've pulled half the galaxy in already.” Hefting the bag over her shoulder she started to walk off. “Alana…” “No,” she said turning around, to jab her finger in the center of his chest, “I’ll tell you the same thing I told Han, I don’t---.” “Han’s dead.” The strap of her bag slipped off her shoulder and she stared at him, “Ben---.” “Killed him,” Luke finished for her. The applause as another table struck big, washed over her, and she could feel her chest tightening. Swallowing she shook her head and turned around, her eyes scanning Rey and Finn’s faces. “Why should I care?” Luke stepped forward, “You know why, because you owe him.” She glared at him, “And my debt is to be paid to you? I don’t think you understand how this repayment thing works.” He shook his head, “Don’t let your anger…” She cut him off, “I’m not some mewling apprentice anymore, so you don’t get to lecture me anymore about controlling my fucking emotions. Especially not since you abandoned me to go gallivanting, who knows where.” “I made sure you were safe,” Luke pointed out. “You left me on Kashyyyk with Chewbacca’s cousin.” “It was for your protection---.” “He tried to sell me off to some pharmaceutical company the moment you were gone!” Luke stared at her for a moment before looking down. “I am sorry, but this isn’t about you and I right now. I need your help Alana.” She glared at him then sighed. Glancing to the side, she saw the guards were beginning to take notice of their little meeting, “Come with me,” she hissed. Picking up her bag she started for the door without them. Finn and Rey, stepped over to Luke, “She didn’t seem very happy to see you,” Finn muttered. Luke sighed, “She was one of my best students. A natural talent and full of potential.” He set a hand on Rey’s shoulder and pushed her forward as Alana waved them over impatiently to the exit in the back of the room, “Count yourselves lucky. You just met the last Jedi knight, Alana Kenobi.” Chapter 3 Notes: There is SMUT here so avert your eyes if that's not why you're here, though you will probably miss some plot points. I swear it is nothing too freaky. (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) 272, 273, 274… Ren counted with each rep. His bare, muscular torso contracted every time he pulled up, and the finally he let himself drop to the ground. The room was dark except for the dim red light coming from the far wall of the training room. Reaching up he pushed his sweat soaked hair away from his face, and picked up a towel to wipe the sweat from his brow. It was the early hours of the morning, another night without a minute of sleep. It seemed to evade him at every turn, and no matter how hard he tried, no matter how many of the drugs he had taken from the ship’s supplies, he was convinced that sleep would not come anytime soon. Turning around he started to pull on his tunic when the door across the room slid open. A young woman walked into the room and froze, staring at him. With a silent glare he turned back around. “I’m sorry, my Lord, I didn’t think anyone else would be here.” “I’m leaving,” he muttered under his breath. Slowly, he lifted his gaze and tried to bore a hole through the wall. He could feel her thoughts like a slime ridden hand ghosting up and down his back. Turning around he started for the door, when she moved in front of him. Green eyes stared out from beneath red bangs, and a smirk morphed itself on her lips. “Move,” he ordered. Tilting her head to the side, she frowned, “Lord?” she asked, lifting a hand readying to set it on his chest. Parting her lips she raised her eyebrow and stared up at him. Ren clenched his jaw as her fingers grazed over the open neck of his tunic. “I said, move ,” he hissed, pushing her hand aside. With wide eyes she stepped aside, and he marched out of the room. ************************************************************************************* Hot water rained down on him, and steam filled the room. Setting his hands against the wall he let it fall on his shoulders, sweeping away the sweat from his skin and the stress from his mind. With a deep breath he closed his eyes and just focused on the pattering sound of the water colliding with his body and the floor. The sound of the door opening behind him drew his attention, and he turned around, water dripping down his face as he peered through the steam. Naked, and bare, the same woman from before sauntered towards him, her hips swaying back and forth with each step. Her long red hair was freed from its tight bun, allowing it to run down her back, and over her shoulders. It laid atop her breasts like a bright red curtain. He turned around and snarled, the want and need rolling off her through the Force. Cool fingers ran down his spine, and she chuckled, “Is this more comfortable for you?” she asked. Spinning around he caught her by her wrists, raised them over her head and shoved her against the wall. A small gasp escaped her but she did not seem very surprised, “They said you had a short temper.” “What do you want?” he hissed, “Who sent you?” “I think you know exactly what I want,” she answered glancing down at his naked body. Arching her back she pressed her breasts against his hard chest. “And no one sent me, I came on my own,” she whispered shaking her head, “I just thought our fearless leader, could use some stress relief. Out of loyalty to your cause of course,” she added quickly. He released her hands and stepped back, “Get out.” She cocked her head. “Do you think I’m the only one to notice that the great Knight of Ren is having trouble sleeping?” Her eyes traveled down his long, hard, and wet body as she stepped closer, then she focused on his lips. “I can fix that. You’ll sleep better than you have in years,” she murmured, her voice husky and low. Ren stared down at her, “And what do you get out of this…Arrangement?” “Absolutely nothing,” she whispered as she drew closer to his face. Ren stared at her. Her last thought ran through his mind as her lips grazed his, Everything. Wrapping his fingers around her biceps he pressed her against the wall, and she naturally wrapped her legs around his waist, letting him hold her weight. Leaning down he barely grazed his teeth over the skin of her clavicle, his hands squeezing the round flesh of her backside. Her sharp nails clawed at his back as he moved further down, teasing her nipples with his tongue. “Kylo…” she sighed. “Shut up.” Looking down he pushed her legs away from him. Standing on her own two feet, she frowned and stared up at him, “Turn around,” he growled. Running her fingers through her long straight hair she did as he said, and pressed her palms against the cold wall of the shower stall. Looking over her shoulder she swayed her hips as he stared down at her. His brown eyes traveled down the soft lines of her body, the bow of her spine, and the curve of her ass. A mixture of thoughts ran through his head, and though everyone thought he was emotionless, he could sense some of those feelings lurking in the depths of his mind. First and foremost was passion, the core of who he really was, and the second was all too familiar, one he had been feeling since that night on Starkiller base. Its name was guilt, and it was rearing its ugly head. I just need to forget. The girl glanced at him and he shook his head, pushing all of that to the back of his mind. And this? This was nothing , for him or for her, so why shouldn’t he just take her? This was just simple fucking, no attachments, and no expectations. Moving forward, he ran his hands down her sides, until one rested on her hip and the other moved towards her core. When his fingers pressed against her she let out a moan and pressed back against him. Her voice went hoarse and she set her jaw as she looked back at him, “Don’t--- Just fuck me.” With somewhat vindictive movements, he moved his hand back through her wet folds, just barely fingering her center before leaving her empty. Her head fell forward and she groaned, waiting for him to make his move, adjusting her hips to spread her legs even further. “Ooooh shit,” she groaned as he pressed against her moving inside her. The tight grip he held on her hips threatened to break and she straightened up as he came to a stop, filling her completely. “Kiss me,” she whispered over her shoulder. She closed her eyes and waited for his mouth to crash into hers. Instead, he stared at her. Reaching up, with one hand, he gripped the back of her neck and forced her back down. Then he began to move. She moaned with almost every stroke, every touch, and her cries echoed off of the walls along with his heavy breaths. Closing his eyes, he set a hand on the wall and continued to pound into her, as the water from the shower rained down on them. How can this feel so… so… God, she’s so wet. Opening his eyes he let out a groan the he had been holding back as she clamped down on him, squeezing him tight as she pressed back and moved with him. Then she did again, and again, until finally she cried out one last time, her body trembling between him and the wall. Ren kept moving, his thrusts losing their rhythm. Looking down he held her by her hips, pulling her back on him every time he moved forward, burying himself inside her slick heat. Waves of fire burned across his body and he pulled out with a shout, as she slid to the ground, “Oh, Fuck!” he shouted as he released. Everything turned black as he stood there, panting, listening to the water splash on the floor. Chest heaving he opened his eyes and looked down to find the girl staring up at him with a blissful smile. “Round two?” ************************************************************************************* “I’m being torn apart,” he whispers. His bottom lips trembles and his face looks almost deathly pale against his long dark hair, “I want to be free of this pain… I know what I have to do, but I don’t have the strength to do it.” He sniffs and clears his throat, as he looks his father in the eye, “Will you help me?” Han steps closer and nods, his face full of love and concern, “Anything.” “NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!” A gut wrenching scream tore from his throat as he sat up in the dark. With a start he jerked awake, blood pounding in his ears. His body shook and he held his head in his hands as he swung his feet off the bed. Damnit. Cool hands slid down his back, “Kylo?” “Don’t touch me,” he spat, pushing her away. A low hum filled the air and she was pressed against the wall before he released her. Still nameless, the woman stared at him, pulling the sheets of his bed up around her body. Silently, she scrambled from the bed and gathered her clothes. He stared at the floor, trying to control his breathing as she got dressed. A few minutes later, and she was standing by the door staring at him. He glanced up at her, “What?” he hissed darkly. Swallowing she crossed her arms, “Mari.” He stared at her impassively, “My name is Mari, if you… need someone to…” she trailed off and he raised an eyebrow. It was the first time that night that she was acting shy. “Where did your bravado go?” he murmured. Narrowing her eyes, Mari turned on her heel and escaped into the hall, leaving him to face the wee hours of the morning alone. Again. *********************************************************************************** The door slid closed behind her and she flipped her hair over her shoulder as she stared at the man sitting before her with his back turned. Rolling her eyes she sauntered across the room and leaned down over the back of his chair, planting a kiss on his neck. “You were right,” she breathed, “He was so pitiful, so needy.” He turned his head and stared at her with hazel eyes, “God, you smell like him, ” he spat with a grimace. She raised an eyebrow and stared at him impassively, “Then you shouldn’t have sent me to him in the first place,” she whispered in his ear, running her fingers through his short red hair. Notes: So.... yeah... Chapter 4 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Alana glared at Luke as she input her code to her hanger bay, “I can’t believe I’m actually considering this,” she muttered as the door opened. She waved them through then stepped inside and closed the door behind her. Rey gasped as she stared up at the ship, a J-type 327 Nubian starship. The silver sleek design stood out against the backdrop of the rusty old hanger. Luke glanced over at Alana, “You kept it?” She shrugged, “Grandpa was good for something it seems.” Luke sighed and shook his head, as she led them inside. Once everyone was inside, she closed the ramp, “Make yourself at home,” she muttered as she threw her bag of credits to the side, and plopped down in an arm chair. “Where did you get this?” Finn asked staring at the still all white interior of the ship. “This thing has got to be---.” “Around fifty years old. Give or take a decade,” Alana finished for him as she crossed her legs, “My grandfather stashed it away on Tatooine. When I left the academy I did some digging around.” “I’m amazed it still runs,” Luke said turning around in circles. “Wait,” Rey said leaning forward on the couch, “Kenobi. Your grandfather was---.” Alana clasped her hands behind her head and leaned back in her chair, “The Obi-wan fucking Kenobi. Unfortunately, yes he was.” Rey and Finn looked at one another while she turned her attention to Luke, “Now, tell me, why are you so desperate for my help? Because thanks to you, the First Order will be pulling into port here any minute, looking for them,” she said pointing to the two youths on the couch. They frowned, “I recognized these two the minute I saw them and I can tell you that this casino is crawling with spies.” “We know that,” Rey said, “That’s why we’re here.” Alana raised an eyebrow as the girl continued to explain, “The Resistance---.” “Can handle itself. They’ve done pretty well, these past thirty years, if you hadn’t noticed.” Luke sat down next to Rey, “Not anymore.” Leaning forward, Alana rested her chin on her fist as Luke spoke, “These spies are everywhere, even in the Resistance,” he looked down, “They got Leia.” “She’s dead too?” “No, but she was attacked. Not enough to kill her but enough to send a message.” Standing up Alana paced as the trio watched her in silence. Turning on her heel she crossed her arms, “And this still boils down, to why you sought me out.” Luke turned to the side. “Give us a minute?” Standing together Rey and Finn walked out of the room, to the cargo hold. Alana shook her head, and wrapped her arms around her lean torso, “I don’t fight anymore, Luke.” “No, you gamble and waste your time hating anyone and everyone that may have wronged you at some point in your life.” “You left us there!” she shouted dropping her hands to her sides, clenching them into fists, “He’s there because you left him.” Luke stood, “I had no choice. If I could have gone back for him I would have,” he hissed. He looked down and softened his voice, “And I will bear the blame. But you stay here in these forsaken bantha nests and hide.” He stared at her, “And you and I both know why. You can’t blame yourself for what happened to Ben.” “Yes, I can.” “Why?” “Because it was supposed to be me!” she cried. Tears ran down her face, “It was supposed to be me! Snoke didn’t want Ben, he didn’t even know who he was. The monster that destroyed our lives could just as easily have been me if you had just left me there and saved him.” Luke stared at her in pain, “That’s a lot of “if’s”.” She wiped her face, “You knew what you were sending us into.” “No, I knew what I was sending you into. You understood the mission as well. I didn’t plan on Ben leaving the academy to…” Alana coughed, “He was my best friend.” “I know.” “And I left him there. I should have been stronger. I should have tried harder.” Biting her lip she sunk down onto the armrest of her chair, “I hear rumors,” she whispered, “About Kylo Ren. What he did on Jakku, how he helped destroy the Hosnian system.” Shaking her head she shuddered and rubbed her palms on top of her thighs, “And a part of me is… relieved.” She looked up at Luke, “I know it’s disgusting and pathetic but it could have been me. I could have been the one to kill all those innocent people.” Luke sat down on the couch and stared at his hands. “That dark side is in all of us, Alana.” She scoffed but he shook his head, “It’s true. That’s how the Force works. You cannot have peace without chaos, therefore good is not inherent.” Alana looked down and shook her head, “Why are you here Luke?” “I told you---.” “No. Why me? Why now?” Luke stared at her, “Because I had no one to turn to. No one else besides those two kids in the next room that I know I can trust. Leia is powerless, Han is dead, and the only person who knows the real story is standing right in front of me,” he said staring her in the eyes. The corners of her eyes pricked with tears, “I can’t forgive you.” “I’m not asking for your forgiveness,” Luke whispered, stepping to stand right in front of her, “I’m asking for your help. If you won’t do it for me, do it for Ben. Don’t waste his sacrifice hidden away like this, Alana. There is more to you than cheating at pazzak and dice games.” She stared at the ground, “I---.” BANG-BANG The sound of something beating on the outer hull of the ship drew her attention, and she moved to the cockpit. Luke followed her, Rey, and Finn following closely behind. Sitting down in the captain’s seat she pulled up a view screen. It showed the port security camera. “Shit,” Alana cursed. Armed thugs stood outside the ship, Gatt the Trandoshan from the casino at the head of the crowd. “What is it?” Finn asked glancing over her shoulder. Reaching over to the side, Alana punched in her code to the hanger bay doors, but red letters flashed on the screen. “Fucking shit!” she yelled standing up, and heading towards the ramp. “What?” the trio asked following after her. “They’ve hacked into the system, the doors are locked. Going to the couch she reached behind it and pulled out a leather bound bundle and began to unwrap it. “There’s a manual release by the exit door, but I won’t be able to hit it unless they’re gone.” “I’ll come with you,” Luke said pulling up his hood. “No,” Alana said shaking her head and throwing the piece of cloth to the side, “I need you in the cockpit, getting those engines ready.” “I can do it,” Rey said. Alana raised an eyebrow and Rey spoke quickly, “I can fly.” Alana looked at Luke and he nodded his head, “Almost as good a pilot as Han and me.” Raising her hand, tightly wrapped around the hilt of a deactivated lightsaber, she pointed at Rey, “Do not mess up my ship.” Nodding furiously, Rey and Finn ran down the hall, as Alana turned towards the ramp and glanced at Luke. He smirked at her, “What?” she spat as she punched a code into the console. Luke nodded to the lightsaber in her hand, “You kept it.” Raising her hand she glared at it, “I figured it might be useful someday.” “You tried to sell it didn’t you?” Luke asked. With a glare she crossed her arms, and looked to the side, “Maybe.” Notes: Four chapters in one day... bravo me... Lol kudos and comments are always appreciated guys, plus it lets me know it people are actually reading this. Suggest away if you see anything wrong! Chapter 5 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) His footsteps thundered behind him as he marched down the hall from the lift. Standing at attention two guards stepped aside as he strode towards the bridge. A small petite woman fell into step beside him, the lip of her cap casting shadows down her face. “Lord Ren,” she said with a knowing grin, “Sleep well?” He glanced at her, “What are you doing here?” Mari pursed her lips and looked down at her data pad pulling up her orders. “Colonel Howe assigned me to be your liaison between the Hutts and yourself.” Grabbing her by the elbow he pulled her around the corner, “I don’t need you here,” he hissed, anger flaring in his gut. Mari raised an eyebrow, and looked him up and down. Licking her lips she moved closer, “Well, then where do you need me?” Footsteps sounded behind them and she stepped away from him, clasping her hands behind her back. Glaring at her, Ren straightened his back as Hux came around the corner. The General came to a stop and bowed his head. “I received word that Chiolbua the Hutt has arrived,” he said glancing between the two, before focusing his hazel gaze on Ren, “Try not to mess this up, the First Order stands to gain invaluable trade routes if all goes well.” With that he stepped between them and went to the bridge. The second he was gone, Ren grabbed ahold of Mari. “Tell anyone about---.” “Us?” she quipped, and gasped as he tightened his grip. “There is no “us”,” he growled. Mari pulled away from him. “You don’t have to worry, I won’t tell anyone about last night,” she said coldly, “I wouldn’t want to get on your wrong side.” With a glare she followed after Hux. Ren stared at her back and gritted his teeth, before following right behind her. ************************************************************************************ “Wonkee lwaa Jee yauma uba?” The great slug asked as Kylo Ren stood in front of it. Hux stood beside him his hands clasped behind his back, and glance at Mari who quickly translated. “The Great Chiolbua asks why she should help you.” Ren crossed his arms, Because I could kill you in four seconds. He glanced at Hux who cleared his throat. “The First Order has many assets to offer---.” The Hutt laughed, its slimy skin smacking together as the creature moved, “Uba gee tanea bam o. Mah pin nallya doth nobata.” Ren and Hux glanced at Mari. She shook her head and looked down, “It says no.” The two men glared at one another before Hux turned back to the woman and motioned to the Hutt, “Ask it again.” She opened her mouth but Chiolbua shook her great, fat head. “She says you have nothing to offer her,” Mari said quickly. Letting his arms fall, Ren stepped closer to the slug and stared into is great eyes, “You will assist us.” He said waving his hand. Chiolbua narrowed her eyes and Hux hissed behind him. “Ren,” he said in warning. With a glare, Ren tried again, “ You will assist us .” Something happened then. Chiolbua’s body relaxed, more than usual, and she let out a slow slobbery sigh, “Jee hatkocanh yauma uba.” Ren turned around to find Mari and Hux staring at him, “I think you have what you need now, General,” he said smoothly before leaving the bridge, leaving all of them behind. ************************************************************************************ He stared at the console, with codes and data scrolling down, as the door opened behind him. With a hiss it closed and Mari cleared her throat, “How did you do that?” He set a hand down on the computer screen and twisted to face her. “Have you not heard the stories?” he asked. She swallowed and moved closer her heels clacking on the hard floor, “So you just magically take what you want and force others to do your bidding?” she asked staring up at him, no space between them. Narrowing his eyes he stared down at her and gripped her chin. “With the Force, I can take whatever I want.” She raised her eyebrows, “Is that right?” Reaching up, she ran her fingers over his scar only to have her hand swatted away. Turning his back on her, he focused on the console and closed his eyes. “Do I make you uneasy?” she whispered. He bowed his head and stared at the console, You throw me off balance . Taking a deep breath he straightened up, “Any word of Skywalker?” He could feel her step away from him, the heat of her skin leaving his back, “This came in a few minutes ago.” Turning around he glanced down at the data pad in her hands, “All three of the Resistance fighters you had us lookout for as well as another woman.” His hood fell back as he grabbed the data pad and pushed past her. Mari frowned and turned around, “Milord?” He stared down at the security footage, of two figures. He knew them both well, Luke Skywalker and Alana Kenobi. They stood surrounded by thugs inside what looked like a hanger. His hands shook as he stared out the window at the large space casino. She's here. In there somewhere. Turning around he threw the data pad with a yell. With a small scream, Mari ducked as it soared over head. When she looked back up he was leaving the room. “Have my shuttle prepared. Now.” Notes: Okay... I'm ready to get rid of Mari. Anyone else? Chapter 6 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Alana glanced at Luke as the ramp opened up, “Who’re the kids?” Luke shot a look over his shoulder, “Finn and Rey… It’s a long story.” Nodding her head Alana dropped her hand as they started down the ramp, “Just let me handle this, I might be able to get them to just leave.” Luke raised his eye brows and she shrugged her shoulders, “I said ‘might.’ Don’t plan on it though.” Pushing her hair over her shoulder she sauntered down to the end of the ramp. “Gatt you green scaled son of a nerf herder, do you mind explaining to me why I’m locked inside my personal hanger?” she yelled. Luke walked behind her and clasped his hands in front of him as the thugs all pointed their guns at them. “Uba cheeska, Jee banag mah phabeka bata!” the alien yelled moving to stand at the bottom of the ramp. She scanned the group of ten or so guards, “Aw, you don’t really mean that. Now, why don’t all of you go back to wherever the hell you came from and get out of my hanger.” Gatt’s tongue slithered over his lips like the snake he was and he stepped closer, “Uba owe me fifty phabeka, human.” Reaching up he started to poke her in the shoulder with the sharp nail on his index finger but Luke caught him by the wrist. Everyone tensed as Gatt yanked his arm back and turned to Luke, who held out his hand, “Perhaps I can pay her debt?” Alana turned and glared at the man, “How are you--- Oh, come on!” Luke brought his hand out from behind his back revealing her bag and all the credits from the game that day. Stepping closer she stared down at him, “No.” “Alana, just pay him, and let’s go,” he hissed giving her the bag. She looked between it and him like a petulant child then turned to Gatt and held out the bag. “Just take it,” she spat. With a fang filled grin the reptile took the bag and turned around, “Uba uueca pisua,” she taunted. Gatt turned around and snarled raising his gun. Luke held up his hands and for the first time, glared at Alana. “What?” she said, refusing to raise her hands. “You couldn’t just pay him, could you?” Alana turned and shook her head, “Just get inside, and see what’s taking so long with those engines.” Luke moved inside the ship and Alana turned around with a smirk, “What’s the matter, Gatt? Bith got your tongue?” “Wahca bimhee, cheeska. Jee hatkocanh duaia mee kloonkee mo!” Stepping forward she opened her mouth just as the door behind them opened. “Shit.” ************************************************************************************* Ten Stormtroopers accompanied him down the ramp, Chiolbua the Hutt waiting at the bottom with her entourage. The big slug held her arms open, “Chobaso bai mah deana, Lorda Ren .” His arms hung at his sides, and his hands were clenched into fists. “Where are they?” With a floppy hand she waved forward one of her slaves, “Canba 2-12. Ua hatkocanh paknee ata uba heee.” He glanced at the purple Twi’lek, her tails falling over her bare shoulders as she bowed. He narrowed his eyes as a wave of impatience washed over him. “Lorda Ren, come with me.” Glancing over his shoulder he nodded to two commandos, who immediately followed after him. They left their ship behind and walked through the tarmac, until they came to another door. Turning the slave motioned to the door and bowed. “Open it,” he commanded. The girl’s eyes widened and she froze, “NOW!” he barked. Flinching she turned around and punched in a code, and the door slid open. With his hood pulled low he moved into the hanger. All eyes turned on him, but he stared at the base of the ship’s ramp. She hasn’t aged a day . Raising his head he stared at her until he came to a stop next to the Trandoshan pointing his gun at her. The creature swung around and aimed at him, and opened its mouth to speak but it had no chance to do so. Vmmmm. Lunging forward he activated his lightsaber and swung down, red spark flying as he severed the alien’s arm. A scream filled the air and the thugs surrounding him all took aim. Running inside the hanger his two commandos opened fire engaging the brutes. Turning around Ren, raised his sword just as Alana swung down at him, the blue hue of her lightsaber clashing with red. With a yell she pushed him back and flourished her sword as he stumbled away from her. Running forward she swiped at him, only to have her attack blocked again. They bared their teeth at one another as their swords locked. “You’re out of practice, Alana,” he seethed as sparks exploded between the two of them, where their lightsabers clashed. Her eyes shined in the light as she stared up at him, “Where’d you get the scar?” she bit back. With a snarl he looked down and pressed forward, rotating the hilt of his sword so the cross-guard burned through the flesh of her right forearm. He let her advance slightly, and she impaled herself on the vents of his sword even more. Screaming in pain, she stepped back as he pushed forward, the heels of her feet hitting the ramp of the ship. Crying out she fell back, and stared up as he raised his hands above his head readying to stab her straight through the heart. ********************************************************************************* “Rey?!” Luke yelled as he ran towards the cockpit. She and Finn were pressing buttons franticly when he ran into the cockpit. “What’s going on?” “I don’t understand any of this,” she yelled reaching up and flipping a switch, “It’s like she rewired the entire system and forgot to label everything.” Luke shook his head and pulled Finn out of the way. As the boy was fleeing the co-pilot’s seat he accidentally caught a switch. A view of the outer flank of the ship came into view and Rey gasped. “Is that---?” Alana fell backwards as a man in black struck down at her. His hood flew back to reveal a jagged scar and long black hair. With both hands on the hilt of his sword he stabbed down at her, but not before she kicked out with her legs, striking him off balance. Rolling to the side, she crouched with on hand on the ground, as she reflected two blaster bolts. Ben came back into view, for a second before Alana ran forward, knocking them both out of the camera’s range. Sitting down, Luke started going through the index of controls and yelled over his shoulder, “Finn get back there and help her out!” ******************************************************************************** Alana yelled as she head butted her opponent, and ducked when he swung at her head. With a flick of her wrist she swiped at his ankles, the tip of her saber grazing his right calf. With a yell he stumbled back, but somehow regained his balance, as his commandos let off more shots. Alana stood tall, and reflected them one after the other, in a dance of flourishes. Her feet moved quickly and almost elegantly across the floor as she moved away from him. When they paused, she held her hand out, a low hum filling the air, and the closest trooper flew through the air like a ragdoll, until he collided with the other, in a tangle of white armor and Gritting his teeth, Ren moved towards her and she moved to stand between him and the ship. He snarled and held his hand out to the two commandos who ran up behind him ready to shoot her, “Join me, or I will kill you and take what I want from them.” “You can’t beat me Ben,” she panted, “You never could.” She stared at him sadly, and backed up the ramp as the ship’s engine powered up, “You really have turned haven’t you?” Alana shook her head, “You sound like your grandfather. Someone you told me you would never become.” “I’m stronger now, Alana. Your skills are no match for mine.” Alana looked down and flourished her sword in her left hand, as blood dripped down onto the ground from the wound on her right. Raising it up she gripped the hilt in both hands and angled it up across her chest. Her eyes glanced to the two Stormtroopers behind him, “Then I guess we aren’t just going to hug this out?” He narrowed his eyes finding no humor in her flippant attitude, “If you’re not with me, you’re my enemy.” Alana flinched at the sound of a blaster firing behind her and the two soldiers behind Ren fell to the ground. He looked over his shoulder and she bent her knees, “Then I am your enemy.” Closing her eyes she jumped into the air and pulled her legs in close as she flipped over and soared over his head. Landing behind him, she parried as he swung at her and pressed him back, until they were moving away from the ship. Finn stood at the top of the ramp with a gun in his hands, staring at them. “The doors!” she yelled. Shaking the shock from his mind he sprinted down the ramp and ran to the console. Refocusing on her target, Alana spun around using her momentum to lash out and kick Ren in the center of his chest. With an “oomph,” he jumped back, leaving himself open enough to bring her the tip of her blade down, cutting through his armor and burning a shallow line on his skin from his left shoulder, down to his right hip. Screaming he threw his hand out and used the Force to send her flying back. She smiled as she landed near Finn just as he got the doors to open. She stared at Ren as he slumped to the ground clutching his chest. Turning around she grabbed the boy by the arm, “Get on the ship, and tell them to go. Hold the ramp open.” With a quick nod he ran to the ship and disappeared inside. Alana turned to the console and raise her sword before slashing through it, to keep anyone from closing it before they could escape. Spinning on her heel she started for the ship, but stopped before her feet touched the ramp, clipping her saber to her belt. Ben stared at her, his eyes burning as he seethed. She started for him when a yell came from the other door and troopers began filing into the hanger. With one last glance, she ran up the ramp. When she got inside, she slammed her hand down on the ramp controls, closing it as the ship began to move beneath her feet. Then it stopped. Holding her arm she ran to the cockpit. “What’s wrong?” Luke glanced back at her as he revved the engines. “It’s Ben, he’s holding us down.” ***************************************************************************** Kill her, his mind screamed at him as she disappeared inside the ship, She’s leaving again, kill her ! When the ramp closed and the ship began to hover and turn, a resurgence of strength flew through him. Stumbling forward he stood on shaking legs and held his hands out to the ship a loud blaring hum filling the air around him. The thrusters glowed bright as they tried to take off, but the ship lurched. He held on, keeping it from moving at all, until his strength began to waver once more. “AAURHHH!!!” With a gut wrenching yell he fell to his hands and knees, before collapsing fully onto his side. The last thing he saw was the ship soaring out of the hanger. Notes: Suggestions are always welcome! Chapter 7 Alana hissed as the med-droid cleaned the wound to her arm and shoulder. Wearing nothing but a bra and shorts she felt exposed. The scars on her back felt particularly apparent. Someone leaned inside the doorway. Turning her head she cocked her head, “Rey, is it?” The girl inclined her head and moved inside, sitting down on a stool. Twisting back around Alana switched the droid off, and set to binding her wounds herself. “I heard you had trouble figuring out the controls. Rey scoffed, “Nothing made sense.” “It would if you were one of Luke’s padawans. We all learned how to reroute to a specific system. It keeps thieves from stealing your stuff, but allies that know the system can still use it.” Turning around she glanced at Rey as she wrapped a strip of cloth around her forearm, “I thought you knew, otherwise---.” “Why would I know?” Rey asked with a frown. Alana cocked her head, “You’re a force sensitive. I can feel it. Isn’t that where he’s been all these years? Training you?” Rey shook her head, “I’ve only been training for the past two months. Luke was searching for the last---.” She stopped when Alana grabbed her by the arm. “The temple? He found it?” Luke’s voice carried over to her from the door, “No. Not yet.” Alana turned around and shook her head, “Eight years and you couldn’t find it?” He looked down, “I---.” “NO! You left for eight fucking years and you found nothing?” “I’m close, Alana,” he said stepping forward, “I’m so close, I can feel it.” “Then why aren’t you there now?” she hissed, crossing her arms. Rey spoke up behind her, “Because we need him. Both of you. The Resistance is falling apart.” Alana looked between the two of them, and Luke sighed, “We’re going there now. It’ll be a few hours, but if you can be patient for once today, Leia can… explain things.” With a sigh he walked down the hall. “Damn it!” Alana hissed kicking the metal wall with her foot with a groan she plopped down in one of the chairs and held her head in her hands. She closed her eyes and focused on controlling her breathing. A few seconds later she heard Rey scooting across the floor to sit in front of her. Pushing her hair back Alana wiped her eyes and looked at her. “Where did you learn to fight like that?” the girl asked, pulling her long legs up and crossing them in the chair. Sniffling, Alana wiped her nose and looked away, “It’s a long story.” Rey shrugged her shoulders, “We have time.” Shaking her head Alana sighed, “My dad died before I was born. He was force-sensitive, but wasn’t trained.” She took a deep breath and slapped her knees, “My grandfather, if he even knew he existed, left to go train and watch over someone else’s kid.” “Luke.” Rey said. “Yep,” Alana whispered. Clearing her throat she started again, “Our planet was under Empire rule and my dad was drafted into the army. He died on the last Death star.” She snorted, “It’s ironic really. Ben Kenobi did everything he could to make sure Luke fought for the Rebel Alliance, and yet his own son died because of…” She shook her head and waved her hand to the side. “My mother had me a few months after the Battle of Endor. When I was three Luke began seeking students for an academy.” Alana sighed and stared up at the ceiling, “That’s the last time I saw her, when she sent me away. Then I started my training.” “And Ren?” Alana’s eyebrow twitched, “I didn’t meet Ben until I was eight. I’m about a year older than him, and he didn’t present with Force abilities until he was seven. He was older than the other students at his skill level and the other masters didn’t want to train him.” “Why?” The Jedi sighed and stared Rey in the eye, “Because of the holocrons.” Rey cocked her head, but Alana spoke over her, “The holocrons are archives from the old Jedi order. That’s where I learned to fight. Darth Vader collected them and when the Empire fell, Luke found them. They’re like…” she searched for the word, “How-to manuals.” “And what did this have to do with, Re--- I mean Ben?” Rey asked leaning forward intently. Alana sighed, “The old masters from before the Fall, asserted that padawans needed to start at a certain age, to basically indoctrinate you into the Order. If they were too old, they would be easier to lead astray.” Rey looked off to the side and muttered sarcastically, “That doesn’t sound like anyone we might know.” Alana looked at her sadly, “You don’t know everything you think you do.” “Did you love him?” “Yes---,” Alana answered but she stopped herself when Rey raised an eyebrow. She scrunched her nose, “But not like… that . We were close. We had to be. All anyone saw when they looked at us was the granddaughter of the great General Kenobi and Darth Vader’s grandson,” she said in disgust. Looking down, Rey pushed a strand of hair behind her ear, “Then what happened to him? You were friends how could he just turn on---.” “Because he didn’t just turn,” Alana spat, rising from her seat. “The First Order… They indoctrinate you. When you’re tortured every day, when they slither inside your mind, and make you watch as you kill your friends and family over and over and over,” she shook her head and turned around to pull on her shirt with a wince, “Eventually you start to believe all the shit, just to get through the pain.” Turning around she tied her hair back as quick as possible, the wound on her shoulder feeling like it was burning. “How do you know all this?” Rey murmured. Alana turned around slowly. “I know because they did it to me.” Chapter 8 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) With a groan he sat up on the table in the med-bay and held his side, the bandages constricting around his chest and pain throbbing throughout his body. The lights above were bright and painful. Squinting he looked up as someone came in the door, the soft clack of heels moving closer and closer. Mari came to a stop in front of him and crossed her arms, “You look like a rancor chewed you up and spat you out again,” she murmured with a smirk. Bracing himself with one hand on the table, he set his feet on the cold floor and tried to stand. His legs shook and he felt Mari try to push him back down, “I don’t need your help!” he yelled. The girl froze as he lashed out, knocking the tray of bandages off the bedside table. Swallowing sharply, she stared at him, her hands hanging in the air in front of her. Closing her mouth she stepped forward with glare. “And I don’t want to help, but it’s my job. So, unless you’re going to kill me, you can shut up and sit down.” Slowly, Ren sat back down and glared up at her as she started to clean the cuts in his arms. “I saw the playback from the security cameras. You could have killed her from the very beginning but instead you gave her time to attack you.” She glanced at him and “tsked.” Licking her lips she wound the bandages around his arm. “A man of your power and position, can’t be that naïve. Can he?” “It isn’t your concern,” he looked away and growled through clenched teeth. Mari’s fingers stilled and she looked into his eyes. She shook her head and chuckled. Ren narrowed his eyes, “What?” Her lips pursed and she shrugged, “Who knew that the Supreme Leader’s favorite could be so cute.” She laughed at the look on his face, “You’re in love with her---.” “Get out.” Mari stopped talking, and stared at him. Reaching up he pushed her hands away from his and she took a step back, “I said, GET OUT!” he yelled. Turning on her heel she fled from the room, leaving him to tend to his own open wounds. ************************************************************************************* The door closed behind her and she shook her head, “Trouble in hell?” a voice breathed next to her. Turning to the side she glared, “He isn’t going to tell me anything. Not anything useful anyway, he doesn’t trust me.” Hux turned and led her down the hall. “A pity, but once the Supreme Leader hears about his failure to capture Skywalker yet again…” Mari ran after him, “Wait! I can still get him to talk, I just need more time. Brendol, I---.” A hand grabbed her by the chin and steely eyes stared into hers. “My name is not yours to utter as you please. Remember who I am, Mari. I’m not as easily seduced by your act as others have been,” Hux seethed and nodded to the infirmary. Her eyes blurred with tears and he let her go with a scoff of disgust. “Find me what I want, or hope to whoever your god is, that you can get off this ship before I push you out an airlock.” Reaching up he pushed down his black cap, and turned around, walking off without a word. ************************************************************************************* Alana plopped down in the co-pilot’s seat with a sigh, the blue light of hyperspace reflecting in her eyes. “She’s a curious thing, I’ll give her that.” Luke glanced over at her and cocked his head. He looked down and twiddled his thumbs. “Rey has a way of getting people to talk without them realizing it.” “She’s a natural at persuasion. I didn’t realize she was doing it until---.” Luke shrugged, “You’re out of practice.” Alana’s hands clenched in her lap and she stared at him, remembering Ben’s words just a few hours previous. Luke raised an eyebrow, “Though she is powerful.” Alana swallowed and raked her fingers through her long hair, “What have you told her?” she asked crossing her legs and leaning back in her chair. Luke shook his head, “Nothing she didn’t need to know. Why? What did you tell her?” “Too much and too little,” she answered, sitting up in her chair to work the ship controls as they came out of hyperspace. Notes: Short chapter… I know! But kind of big on setting up for future plot points if you pay attention to the Ben & Mari convo. Anyways, I took it upon myself to give Hux a name: Brendol. I got this from reading the wiki. The background on him says that his father was named Brendol Hux as well and was a commandant in the Empire. I figured that anyone that would be a commandant in the Empire would probably name his son after himself… selfish son of a nerf herder. So there you go. Also, Mari might be sticking around for a while. Does anyone actually read these note thingies? Chapter 9 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “They didn’t sound very happy with you,” Alana said as Luke cut the comms with the Resistance. He looked to the side and stared out the window, observing the ice covered planet, “Well, I may have… left without their permission.” Her hands froze on the controls and she cocked her head to stare at him, “Since when do you need permission to do anything?” Luke laughed darkly and shook his head, as they flew over an ice blue glacier. “The trials of joining a military organization. It’s a long story.” Snow and fog sprayed up from the ground as they touched down. With a sigh they both stood, and Alana started for the back ramp, when Luke caught her by the arm, “Just let me do the talking this time?” She narrowed her eyes but conceded with a stiff nod. Looking down she let him pass and walked behind him. Finn and Rey stood next to one another pulling on heavy coats. Alana stopped when she glimpsed lights flashing beneath Finn’s shirt, and reached out to touch his neck. The man turned around and jumped back. Slowly she pulled her hand back, “Sorry.” He and Rey glanced at one another, as the girl held out a coat to Alana, “Ren injured him when he was trying protect me.” Alana glanced at Finn and he nodded looking down. “Without the implants I couldn’t walk.” Alana gave a small silent nod and pulled on her coat as Luke stepped in front of the group and opened the ramp, “They’re going to split us up, you two,” he said pointing to Rey and Finn, “Followed me because I ordered you to, and you,” he said to Alana, “Just try not to piss anyone off.” She sneered, “I’ll try to remember your diplomacy lectures, master .” Shaking his head, Luke led the group down the ramp. Alana crossed her arms and followed after them. The first thing that she noticed was that it was cold, really cold. “What is it with you guys and ice planets?” Through the snow she could see a group of soldiers moving towards them, “Put your hands behind your heads!” a voice yelled. Luke turned and nodded to them, and they did as they were told. Alana raised an eyebrow as a young man a just a year or so older than herself came forward. Finn shifted on the balls of his feet next to her. “Poe---.” The young man glanced at him sadly, “I have orders to place all of you under arrest.” He turned to Luke and spoke quietly, “You shouldn’t have come back.” Luke leaned forward, “We need to see Leia---.” A voice yelled over the wind, as a blonde woman, with steel grey eyes hair pulled back into a tight bun came forward, “I’m afraid that will not be possible at this time. You’re under arrest for insubordination,” she said glancing at Finn and Rey, “All of you.” Her eyes fell on Alana who stared at her sharply. “Maura,” Luke said stepping towards her. The guards behind her tensed and he stopped but continued to talk to her, “I just need to see my sister, then we’ll be out of your hair.” “And what sort of message would that send to the rest of the Resistance? Jedi are above the rules of command?” she shook her head, “No, you are all under arrest and suspension, until I decide just what is to be done with you.” She glanced behind them, “And your ship is now the property of the Resistance.” Alana lunged forward only to be caught by Finn and Luke, “You can’t do that!” Luke whispered in her ear, “Calm yourself.” Maura stepped forward, “Yes, I can sweetheart.” Turning around she murmured to Poe, “Take them to the detention cells.” ************************************************************************************* Alana glared at Luke, as she leaned against the cold metal wall of her individual cell, “You knew this was going to happen. Why did you bring us here? What aren’t you telling me?” Luke glanced down the hall making sure the guards were not listening in, “Maura took control of the Resistance when Leia got hurt. She’s running it into the ground, pulling troops from essential positions in the galaxy, ruining trade route agreements. She’s cutting us off from allies.” “Why didn’t you tell me this before?” she hissed frantically. Luke looked down, “Well there was always a chance they would just shoot us on sight… I didn’t want to worry you.” Alana groaned and pressed her cool fingers to her temples, as she began to pace, “Why didn’t you step in?” “I did. She threatened to have me locked up in here,” he laughed looking around his cell, “Before I came back with Rey, I was close to finding the Last Jedi Temple, Alana, I swear I could taste it.” He shook his head and looked back at her, “But if this has taught me anything, it’s that I need people I can trust, people who are skilled. You and I, we’re better than the common soldier, but we’re nothing when we’re alone.” “So, you want to get rid of Maura,” Alana said, shaking her head. “No, she’s too well protected, too clever. Anything we do, would only give her more political power. I need your help to get Leia back.” Alana pushed off the wall and moved closer to the entrance to her cell, “Leia?” Luke looked down, “You remember the stories, from the holocron, the legends of the temple. The power and knowledge we might find there could help us defeat the First Order.” Alana started to object but he held out his hand, “Now, the last time I saw Leia I gave her all of my data and info, and she’s working to decrypt it. To find the Temple, we have to find her.” He looked to the left and moved away from the front of the cell as the guards marched by. Alana leaned against the wall and stared at them, her mouth in a hard line. “And how are we supposed to do that from in here?” she hissed as the guards moved out of sight, “They took our weapons, my saber… my ship ,” she muttered bitterly. “Ahem,” someone cleared their throat down the hall. Finn’s voice carried to her cell, “You still don’t see it do you? We still have friends in the Resistance.” Alana glanced back at Luke to find him sitting on the floor, and closing his eyes to meditate. A wide smile spread across his lips. “You know me, I always have a plan.” Marching footsteps came running down the hall and Alana moved back as the guards stopped in front of her cell. Pulling down the shield that was boxing her in, they pressed in on her, before lunging forward and grabbing her by the arms. She struggled, and almost lashed out at them with her powers, when she glimpsed Luke shaking his head, “ Don’t fight, ” he mouthed. With heavy breaths and one last glare, she let them pull her from the cell, and lead her further into the base. Notes: The next couple of chapters are just going to be Alana and the gang, with a few snippets of Ren. Chapter 10 Alana snarled at one of the guards and fought to not laugh when he backed away from her. The restraints on her arms bit into the skin, and she looked down, trying to work her way free. “Alana Kenobi,” Maura murmured as she looked up from her desk. Streams of sunlight came in through the window behind her, making it hard for Alana to see her face. Squinting her eyes she glared at the woman. Maura laughed, “You don’t recognize me, do you?” “Should I? “You were about thirteen the last time we met. Luke’s favorite student,” she mused. Alana frowned. “We couldn’t have met. I was at the academy. Only---.” “Only people approved by your master could step foot on that little planet. Luke and I go way back.” Alana moved forward and the guards moved with her. She glanced at them and came to a stop once she got a better view of the woman’s face, “You two were… Friends I take it?” Maura laughed and raised her eyebrows, as she stood from her desk. Slowly she walked around it, and leaned against it crossing her arms, “We were friends, at least before he went off the reservation… Not that I blame him entirely. What happened to you and your classmates was tragic.” Looking down she toed the carpet with the end of her black boots, “I hear you faced down Ben Solo, and obviously lived to tell about it. How is he these days?” she jeered Alana shrugged and set her jaw, “He pretty much just reads back the First Order company line. You know, galactic domination and all that.” Shaking her head she sighed and let her shoulders slump forward as she shifted on the balls of her feet, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t recognize you---Must not have left that big an impression. Luke had a lot of visitors while I was growing up.” “Of course he did,” Maura bit back, “He was a popular man, but let’s talk about what’s really important, shall we?” Stepping down she came to a stop in front of Alana, and stared up at her studying her from head to toe, “Why would he risk getting arrested, just for you?” Alana stepped forward and stared down at the shorter woman, “No idea.” Maura turned around, “Why does he want to see General Organa?” “He thought they could trade recipes,” Alana answered with a smirk. SLAP! Alana’s head snapped to the side as Maura’s palm stung her cheek. She blinked her eyes and looked back up at the woman. “I am not the bad guy here,” Maura spat, sticking her finger in Alana’s face, “I’m just trying to help our people survive, and bring some order to this---.” “And you do that by pulling troops back from strategic positions?” Alana asked in disgust. “God, who in their right mind put you of all people in charge?” Maura stepped back as Alana pressed inward on her, until the guards grabbed her from behind. Looking down at the woman, she spoke through clenched teeth, “You have no right to hold me. I demand that you release me and return me to my ship.” Maura seethed, “You are nothing here, Alana. No rights, no power, no voice. What I say goes.” “That sounds like a good way to get yourself killed, if you ask me,” Alana growled and narrowed her eyes as the woman waved her off and sat down behind her desk. “We could have done this the easy way, but I see you still a lot to learn about diplomacy and respect for your betters.” She looked down at the data pad on her desk and pulled on her glasses. Glancing over the silver rims she waved off the guards, “Take her back to her cell.” Alana shook off the guards, “You aren’t better than me, Maura. You’re just some official the Resistance put too much trust in, and now you’re letting it burn around you as sit in that pretty chair of yours and watch.” Maura stared at her as she turned her back and let the guards lead her away. ************************************************************************************* Her head pounded with every step they took down the hall, the dull thud of the guard’s boots resounding between her ears. Soon they turned around a corner and she looked up at the sound of Poe’s voice and narrowed her eyes. He glanced at her as the group came to a halt then turned to the officer in charge, “I’ll take her from here captain.” Alana glanced down at his hands that he had balled up into fists at his sides. The knuckles were red and bloody. The man in front of her glanced over his shoulder, “She’s too dangerous. Colonel Appo, gave orders for us to accompany her back to her cell,” he answered Poe, as he turned back around and stared down at the pilot. Poe nodded his head and began to turn and Alana cocked her head, when he spun around and decked the Captain. The guards around her yelled and she body slammed one into the wall on her right, as Poe brawled with the others. Then a blaring roar sounded behind her and she turned just in time to duck as Chewie hurled a guard down the hall. Thirty seconds later and all three of them were looking around at the carnage surrounding them. Panting, Poe ran over to her and undid her restraints. The metal gloves clattered to the floor and she rubbed the blood back into her hands. Grabbing her by the hand Poe led her down the hall. With a yell she dug her heels into the ground and pulled him to a stop. He turned around. “What?” “The others, what about them?” she asked. He glanced over her head at Chewie who chortled. “They’re taking the Falcon. You and Chewie are going to take your ship.” Alana looked between them, “Then wait, this whole thing was just---?” Poe grabbed her by the hand again, “It’s a breakout plan. Now can we go?” Chapter 11 Mari glanced down the empty hall behind her and reached up, pulling at the tie holding her long red hair back. She shook her head letting it fall down her shoulders as she came to a stop in front of the familiar black doors. Closing her eyes she swallowed and knocked on the door. No answer. Taking a deep breath she pushed it open and went inside. The room was dark, red light coming from the window where a tall dark figure sat. He did not look at her but said, “When people don’t answer it usually means you’re unwelcome.” She stared at him before closing the door. Silently she walked over to him and knelt down. He stared down at her, “You look different. Like---.” She reached out towards him but he pushed her hand away. With a pout she looked down, “I thought you would like this better, if I looked like her.” Kylo’s face stayed unchanged. “What do you want from me?” he whispered. She raised an eyebrow and peered up at him, “You.” Leaning up she tried to kiss him but he stopped her. “Hux sent you,” he murmured. Mari’s eyes widened and she stared at him. Ren chuckled, “How foolish did you think I was? How weak?” The woman sat back on her knees, “How long have you known?” “You think you’re the first woman of his to be sent my way?” he asked shaking his head, “Hux has been wanting my position for a long time.” Mari looked down and he raised an eyebrow, “Or am I wrong about that? There’s something else he wants.” Slowly, he stood up and moved towards her. She rose from the floor and stepped back, her back pressing against the cool glass of the window. Her hands shook and she stared at him, “I can give you information, I can do---.” “Who are you more afraid of?” he asked coming to a stop just a couple inches from her. He reached up and lifted her chin, forcing her to look at him. “I don’t want your love, or your body. I don’t want your mind. Your loyalty is nothing,” he hissed, gripping her chin tightly. She whimpered but could not escape him. He lowered his face and glared at her, “I want your fear.” ************************************************************************************ Chewie let out a roar and Poe stopped. Alana stepped to the side slipping her hand out of his, and poked her head around the corner, “How much further to the hanger?” Poe knelt down rubbed his hands together, “Down the hall on the right.” “And we’re just going to walk in there? They aren’t going to stop us?” she asked nodding to the guards around the corner. Reaching around Poe pulled something out of his back pocket and handed it to her. “Luke told me to tell you to try not to kill anyone this time.” Reaching down she took the lightsaber from his hands and turned it over in her hands as she shook her head. Standing up Poe cracked his neck and shrugged his shoulders. “Alright, Chewie. You’re up.” With a growl the Wookie, held out his blaster to Poe who took it and stepped to the side. Narrowing his eyes, Chewie lumbered down the hall, with Alana and Poe peeking out around the corner after him. The two guards glanced at each other as Chewbacca drew near, and he barked at them and waved them over. Slowly one met him halfway, and stared up at the creature. A roar and a scream echoed off the walls as Chewie hefted the guard through the air, knocking the other over in a tangle of limbs. Both men struggled to get up as the Wookie marched over to them and grabbed them by their heads before slamming them together. With a groan they slid to the floor unconscious. Alana and Poe glanced at each other before running down the hall, “Good job Chewie,” Poe muttered as threw the bow caster to the shaggy creature, and knelt down and fished a key card off one of the men. Standing up he handed it to Alana. “Use this it will open the door, you and Chewie get out of here and take off. He knows where to go.” Stepping back he started down the hall, “What about you?” Alana called after him. Poe turned around and grinned, holding his arms open wide. “I’ll find my own ride off this popsicle.” With a laugh he ran around the corner and disappeared. Sighing, Alana turned around. “Alright, I guess that means you’re in charge,” she said shrugging her shoulders. Chewie barked as he threw back his head and opened the door. Reaching behind her, Alana unclipped her saber from her belt and held it down at her side as they entered the hanger. Sparks fell down from the mechanics working on various ships. Droids rolled by and she scanned the room. On the upper level she saw the Amidala sitting with no guards, the ramp sitting wide open. Glancing at the Wookie beside her she started for the ladder, when someone yelled behind her. “Hey you, stop!” Alana’s thumb rested on the button of her saber as she turned around readying herself to fight the guards off, but she wasn’t the object of their focus. On the other end of the hanger, Rey and Finn fought off a couple of guards as Luke ran by them, holding someone in his arms. Gritting her teeth she started for them, but Chewie caught her by the arm and yanked her back. She looked over her shoulder and caught Luke’s gaze just as he disappeared inside the Millennium Falcon , with Rey and Finn not far behind. Hairy paws pushed her up the ladder, and looked down to find Chewie scrambling up behind her. Panting she reached the top platform and ran inside the ship. It was empty. That at least was a comfort. Everything else made her vision go red. Tiles were pulled up, wiring exposed. The cabinets and footlockers where she stored her things were empty, the contents strewn throughout the ship. “Rrrwrwrr,” Chewie roared as he closed the ramp behind her. Alana only caught the end of it but it basically translated to, “We have more important things to do than stand here looking around.” Throwing his bowcaster to the side he pushed past her and ran towards the cockpit. “Hey!” she yelled running after him. Chewie sat down in the co-pilots chair and Alana sat next to him as they started the engines. The Falcon rose up in the air above them and she caught a glimpse of Rey and Luke in the cockpit, before they piloted their way out of the hanger, blasters shooting at them from below. “Alright, Chewie, that’s our cue.” The Wookie grumbled next to her, as she took control of the ship. Pulling in the landing gear, she followed after the Falcon. ************************************************************************************* They opened up their comms as they left the planet’s atmosphere. “Luke, what’s going on?” she demanded as they flew parralell with the Falcon . Luke’s voice came over the radio, and she looked to the side and peered at the other ship, “You kept Maura busy longer than I planned.” She narrowed her eyes, “Don’t tell me that’s the only reason you brought me here.” “It’s not.” His voice cut out for a few seconds, “I’ll tell you more once we get to---.” Alana turned off the comms when alarms began to blare. Chewie growled beside her and she pulled up the scanners, “I know, I know!” She flipped back on the comms as she stared at the little blip following behind them, “Luke, we’ve got company. It looks like an x-wing.” The Jedi didn’t answer and she called his name again, “Luke---.” “Calm down,” another voice said, “If I was going to do anything you’d be dead already.” Alana cocked her head to the side. “Poe?” Static scrambled the comms but his voice bled through, “Who else would it be?” Alana shook her head but couldn’t help the small smile pulling at her mouth, “I don’t know, how about the rest of you squadron?” “BB-8 took care of them. Their droids are busy sending them to Coruscant for a couple days of R&R.” Flipping off the radio, Alana turned to Chewie, “I kind of like this guy.” The big ball of fur shook his head, before sending them into hyperspace. Chapter 12 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Alana walked down the ramp, pulling her poncho closed and scrunched her nose at the stench of decaying plant life and the swamp surrounding them. She spied the rest of the group camped in the center of their three ships, a small fire ablaze in the darkness. “He always chooses the most luxurious places to hide out,” she said as she joined them. Rey sat next to Finn across from Poe who she sat down by. “Where is he?” she asked. Rey nodded to the ship behind them, “With Leia.” Alana dropped her gaze and stared into the fire, “So that’s why we went back.” Looking back up she stared at all three of them, “Tell me what happen. I’m tired of lagging behind all of you and I’m not going to be the last to know everything anymore.” She stopped as they all stared at her. “What now?” she asked with a sigh. Rey looked to the side, “It’s just that you don’t act like a Jedi.” “What?” Alana asked flatly. Poe cleared his throat next to her, “You aren’t what we expected, from the stories and everything. You don’t speak like a---.” Alana glared at him and crossed her arms, “I’m sorry I prefer to get to the point of the conversation, rather than talk my way around it. Would it make you more comfortable if I started speaking in tongues?” Quickly she stood up, “I know I’m abrasive and I don’t care about your feelings. Give me the facts or give me a target, but I’m not here to be your friend,” she said glaring at the two men, “Or your mentor,” she spat at Rey. “There’s only one reason I’m still here and it has nothing to do with you three and your galactic problems.” Pulling up her hood she stalked across the spongy ground and marched up the ramp into the Falcon . Poe sighed and turned around and stoked the fire, peering over the flames, “Wonderful girl. Where did you dig her up?” he asked as the flames grew higher, “Either I’m going to kill her or I’m beginning to like her.” ************************************************************************************* Alana stood in the doorway of the Falcon’s main hold with her arms crossed. Luke glanced at her from across the room, and looked down at the bed beside him and set a hand on Leia’s shoulder. The woman waved him off and he moved over to Alana’s side of the ship. He frowned the closer he got. “What’s wrong?” “In general?” she asked sarcastically, “The universe.” Luke sighed and motioned down the hall, “Come with me.” He led her down the hall until they entered the cockpit, “I could feel you from all the way outside,” he murmured, “You’re angry.” “You think?” she asked, plopping down in the copilot’s chair, “Everything you’ve said since the casino has been a lie, and I’m pretty sure most of the stuff from before that was a lie as well.” He gazed at her from across the aisle, “Why did you get into gambling?” “I was good at making it look like I had luck and skills,” she answered, “I knew when to lose to make it seem real and when to win.” She narrowed her eyes and crossed her legs, “I learned pretty quickly that money gets you what you want and more importantly it gets you what you need.” “So you didn’t find it entertaining?” Alana shook her head, “What does this have to do with anything?” “You learned to survive on your own,” Luke said, “You’re angry because now you need someone else to tell you your next move.” “I was doing perfectly fine, until you lead the First Order straight to me,” she spat. Luke shrugged, “You can still go back, but you and I both know that Ben is searching for you. He’s going to kill you.” “He can try,” she murmured as she looked out the window. She looked back at Luke when he shook his head. “You can only keep him at bay for so long, before he will finally strike you down. Alana, you know what’s going to happen. All you need to do is accept it.” She set her jaw, “I won’t kill him.” “Then he will kill you.” Alana uncrossed her legs and arms and stared down at her feet, “Somehow… I’m almost okay with that.” “You shouldn’t be,” Luke whispered, “But if you are unwilling to stop him then I will find someone or something that can.” “You never did play fair.” She looked up at him, “Your temple. Did Leia figure it out?” Luke shook his head, “She found the next piece.” “Another one? What happened to your, “I can almost taste it” feeling?” The Jedi master looked down and pressed his fingers together, “One piece leads to another then another and another…” “And you just what, trust and hope that it will be there eventually? What if it never even existed in the first place, Luke? You’re just on a wild mynock chase. Or what if it doesn’t do what you hope?” He stared at the ground and she sighed, “Where is this next piece of the puzzle anyway?” Luke looked up at her, “Malachor.” She stared at him, “You’ve got to be kidding. There’s nothing there but Sith ruins and---.” The old man shook his head and held out his hands, “It where the maps point next. I’ll take Rey tomorrow to scout it out and search.” He cleared his throat, “I was hoping you would come along as well.” Notes: Reason I chose Malachor: 1) is canon 2) is supposedly the place Ren gets his lightsaber building instructions lol. Two character cross paths again soon! Also what do you guys think of Poe/OFC? I know a lot of people ship Poe/Finn, but since it hasn't been proven yet, I'm thinking of trying my hand at a straight Poe relationship. Let me know below! For those of you who don't know me, I love comments and I always try to input reader's thoughts! Chapter 13 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Grey Jedi Code There is no Dark Side, nor a Light Side There is the Force I will do what I must to keep the balance The balance is what keeps me together There is no good without evil, but evil must not be allowed to flourish There is passion, yet emotion ********************************************************* Alana marched down the corridor until she was in the main hold once more. A faint cough echoed to the side, and she turned, blue eyes framed with crow’s feet smiling over at her sadly, “Alana,” Leia murmured. The young woman opened her mouth, then stopped opting for a softer tone, “It’s been a long time.” “Seven years,” Leia said with a nod, “You’re still as beautiful as always though.” She lifted her hand and coughed raggedly. Alana picked up a box of handkerchiefs and handed it to the woman who took it gladly, “Luke told me about the casino. He said you… saw Ben?” Alana sighed and sat down on a stool, “I saw him. He’s… different.” “They told you about Han?” Leia asked. “I’m sorry---.” Leia held out her hand, “I know he came to see you, and I know what you told him.” She cleared her throat, “I’m curious as to why you’re so willing to fight now, after you turned Han down.” Alana looked down at her hands, “I don’t want to fight, but I don’t want to run either. I’m… I’m lost.” Leia watched her and she shook her head, “I just want to be left alone. You have Luke and Rey, why can’t you just leave me out of it?” They stared at each other in silence and Alana tapped her foot impatiently as she grew more and more uncomfortable, “Well… Good talk,” she muttered as she rose from her seat and turned for the door. “My son,” Leia murmured, “Are you going to kill him?” Alana looked down but didn’t look back, “It’s what everyone seems to want, but I---,” she stopped herself and pulled up her hood, “If he tries to kill me, I will do what I have to so that I can survive.” Leia closed her eyes, “Were you always this selfish?” Alana took a deep breath and left the ship, leaving Leia’s question unanswered. ********************************************************************************* It was like walking on the coupling cables of a speeder bike. She couldn’t sleep. Her whole body was tense, the muscles in her back were bunched, and the balls of her feet never seemed to touch the floor as she walked from one end of the ship to the other. “Why do I get the sense that you’re one step away from flying this bucket of bolts off planet?” a voice asked from behind her. Slowly she turned around and wrapped her arms around her torso as Poe came into the Seruna’s main hold. She pushed her hair behind her ear and looked down, “Don’t think I haven’t considered it. Apparently I’m just selfish enough to do it too.” He leaned against the doorway and cocked his head, “Who said you’re selfish?” “Nobody,” she said crouching down and pushing a torn tile back into place on the wall. She turned her head to the side and looked at Poe’s feet, “It’s just--- this whole universe isn’t big enough for all of us. I just want to be---.” “Alone?” Alana stopped and looked up at him, “No. Not alone, but I--- What’s so wrong about wanting to live to see another day, to survive? How does that make me such an evil, loathsome person?” She shook her head and moved over to the next panel and began to work on the wiring. Poe crouched down next to her and peered inside the wall, before stripping two wires, “Some of us want more than just to survive.” She glanced at him, “So you’re not just a pilot you’re a philosopher too?” He chuckled, “I don’t think anyone’s called me that before.” Screwing the panel back into place they stood and dusted off their hands. Poe lowered his gaze and stared down at her face. She looked away and walked to the other side of the hold, “Do I make you uncomfortable?” he asked. Alana threw a look over her shoulders, “Don’t take it personally, but people in general make me uncomfortable.” “Because you don’t trust us?” he asked. “Why should I?” she spat in retort, “I can’t even trust the man who basically raised me and you want me to trust people I just met?” she shook her head, turned around and began to clear the couch off , “I get screwed left and right whenever I do.” Poe looked down at his feet and nodded his head with a laugh, “You sound like a pessimist.” “I am,” she said pursing her lips and trying not to smile, “And what’s wrong with that? I have a realistic outlook compared to some people. I guess you wouldn’t know that though, from behind that flight stick of yours.” Poe’s feet dragged across the floor behind her and she pushed back her hair. She could feel his eyes boring into her back and she cleared her throat, “No offense.” Cool fingers moved over the scars peeking out from the neck of her shirt and she spun around. Poe held his hands up. “No offense,” he quipped. Alana reached up and fixed her collar before plopping down on the couch. Poe nodded to her scars with his chin, “Did you get those in training?” She peered up at him and stared into his chocolate brown eyes, “Not the training you’re thinking of, but yes. They’re reminders.” She looked down and shrugged her shoulders as though she was stifling an itch. With a sigh she twiddled her thumbs and glanced up at him, “Was there something you needed?” Poe smiled and she tore her gaze away from his. Standing up he looked around the hold, “I saw that you were the only one still awake.” He ran his fingers through his short black hair and sighed as he stretched, “And I guess I thought I’d like to know more about you, since we’ll be working together that is.” Alana crossed her arms, and shook her head, “It won’t be for long. I’m not sticking around, once Luke figures out what he’s going to do.” She scrunched her nose and looked him up and down, “We really shouldn’t bother getting to know one another.” The corners of Poe’s mouth twitched and he looked down and cleared his throat, “See, when you say it like that, it really only makes me want to know more.” Alana’s mouth fell open and he turned around with a chuckle, “Goodnight.” She narrowed her eyes as he exited the ship leaving her to the solitude she had so adamantly lobbied for. ************************************************************************************ “Wake up.” Alana moaned and rolled to the side, snuggling deeper into the couch as someone shook her shoulder, “Come on kiddo, we’ve got to get a move on.” Blinking her eyes she groaned and sat up, Luke standing over her. She frowned. “You really must be trying to get me to go dark side,” she muttered, looking out the window. It was still dark outside, the stars bright in the sky, though Dagobah’s moon was nowhere in sight. Luke shook his head, his smile gone, “Don’t joke about that.” “Then don’t shake me awake in the middle of the night,” she spat as she swung her legs off the couch, and stood. Luke’s mouth was drawn in a tight line. “Just get ready and meet us on the Falcon.” Alana glared at his back as he stalked out of the ship and bent down, pulling on her boots, “Asshole.” *********************************************************************************** “Oh, shut it,” she spat as some snake like creature hissed at her on her way up the Falcon’s loading ramp. Soft footsteps greeted her and she looked up to find Finn and Leia coming down the ramp. Finn gave her a stiff nod, but Leia passed by without a glance or a word. Alana shook her head and went inside. “If we’re not back in two days, stay here until Leia’s well enough then go to the Outer Rim, she’ll know more,” Luke told Poe as they walked from the main hold. They shook hands and Poe walked towards her. He gave her a small nod. “Good luck,” he murmured as he passed her by. Alana glanced over her shoulder at him until he disappeared down the ramp. Chewie lumbered out from behind Luke and left the ship as well, closing the ramp behind him. When she turned back around Luke was waiting for her. She walked up to him and they went further into the ship. “Rey and I will handle finding the landing site,” he said, his tone short and gruff. Alana lifted her head, “Sounds like you don’t really need me. The only three Jedi left, and you’re putting us all in one basket.” Luke raised an eyebrow, “So you’re a Jedi now? I wasn’t so sure that that was what you wanted.” She grit her teeth, “Who cares about what I want, right? We’re Jedi so we’re selfless and all that crap,” she said waving her hands in the air. She waved him off, “Just point me at what you want slaughtered and I’ll get rid of it.” Setting her hands on her hips, Alana waited for him to start lecturing, but the lecture never came. Instead, he sighed and led her to the cockpit where Rey awaited them. The girl gave a stiff nod and turned around in the co-pilot’s chair. R2-D2 twittered beside her and waddled in place as the engines revved and they took off, leaving Dagobah behind. ************************************************************************************* “Return to Hux, tell him the truth. You work for me now,” he said, letting Mari collapse to the floor in a quivering mess of tears and gasps. Looking out the window, he stared at his own reflection, “Now, get out.” Mari stumbled towards the door and he turned around as the console behind him began to beep in alarm. “Wait,” he ordered. The girl froze and stared at him. With a swipe of his fingers data and reports began to float in the air as a hologram. MALACHOR SENSOR ALERT Narrowing his eyes he pulled up the planet satellites a familiar ship falling into the planet’s orbit. Turning to the side his eyes fell on the girl at the door, “On second thought, have my ship prepared. It’s time I paid a visit to where this all began.” Mari took a deep breath then fled from the room. Kylo set his jaw and looked down pressing his hand to his shoulder with a wince of pain. “I won’t let you get away. Not this time, Alana.” Notes: So no one said anything about a Poe romance thingy so I'm going to see what I can do with this... I have no shame. Chapter 14 Black sand slipped through her fingers, and a hot wind blew through her hair. Blue eyes scanned the flat land of the dead world Malachor, taking in its millennia long death, and the secrets that lay beneath their feet. Storm clouds gathered on the horizon, lightning breaking through the swirling vapors. Tilting her head up, she peered up at the sky as a black ship moved above. “We’re out of time, Luke,” she yelled with a glance over her shoulder. A great obelisk of stone, at least five hundred feet in length, lay across the plain decorated in ancient symbols. Craters marred the earth around it. Rey scrambled over the rock, placing the last of the charges around it. Standing up, Alana pulled up her hood and ran to stand beside Luke and Rey, “What’s your plan? Run, don’t run, what?” Luke turned to Rey, “Take the Falcon. Hide out in the asteroid belt around the smaller moon.” Rey set her jaw but ran up the ramp without them. Looking down Luke and Alana stared at the detonator in his metal hand. With a silent nod he reached down and tucked it away in the pouch of his belt. Luke’s grey hair fluttered in the wind as they stared through the swirling sand as the imperial shuttle came closer, and the Falcon took off. Bright light blinded their eyes. “This isn’t how I planned this,” he yelled. Alana buried her face in her elbow, “Yes, well, technical issues. We all have them. Although, next time, perhaps we could go somewhere without dangerous levels of radiation, gas, and storm beasts!” “We can’t let him get to the star map,” Luke yelled as the wind finally died down and the shuttle’s ramp began to lower. “Yeah, yeah. Keep the balance and all that,” she said dropping her hand to her hip. Her fingers grazed the black leather hilt of her saber as she stared at the ship. Steam came up from the underside as a lone figure stomped down the ramp. His hood was pulled low and when his boots hit the ground they sent up plumes of black dust in their wake. He walked towards them his arms tense at his sides, his hands balled up into fists. The black shawl on his shoulder blew in the wind. Gone were the long robes and cloaks he had used before. Now his armor was lighter, protecting his torso, but leaving his legs defenseless. Dark eyes peered out at them from beneath his hood, with circles of exhaustion stark beneath his eyes. He looked exhausted, and the way he favored the right side of his body told Alana that he was not completely healed from their last encounter. His eyes studied her from head to toe before they focused on Luke. “Uncle. It’s been a long time.” “Not long enough,” Luke said, his voice full of pity, not anger, “I had hoped you would see the light again with time, but I see now that that was just wishful thinking.” Ren’s mouth twitched and he stared off to the side, “There is no light. There never was.” Luke glanced down and Kylo laughed, “What’s this? You aren’t going to even try to persuade me? Solo did a more convincing job of acting as though he cared for me. I thought you would at least try.” Luke shook his head, “Your father loved you, Ben.” The young man scoffed, “Yes his death was such a testament to that love.” Alana shifted on the balls of her feet, “You don’t have to do this Ben. You can leave the First Order any time. You’re stronger than I was.” “Of course I am. I’m strong enough to see that power is what you take,” he spat, “You gave up too easily Alana, letting him drag you back to the light,” he said glaring at Luke. “I see it now. The Supreme Leader---everything, it’s perfectly clear. You could have been so much more. I command the Dark Side, and you fear it. Which of us is weaker?” “Well,” Alana said glancing at Luke, “When you put it like that---.” “This is no time to be joking, Alana,” Luke hissed. She sighed and looked back at Ben. She pressed her shoulders back and shrugged off her cloak, letting it fall to the ground around her feet. “You really are lost if you think that you are in control of anything,” she murmured. Pushing back his hood Ren stared at her, “That’s clearly a matter of opinion,” he spat. He looked behind them at the charges they had set, “You’ve wasted enough of my time with your lies. Whatever you’re here for, the First Order will make better use of it.” Luke sighed and untied his cloak from his throat. His hand reached down and he gripped his sword, “The secrets buried here aren’t for the likes of Snoke and who you have become. You’ll have to kill me, Ben.” The dark haired man sneered, “I was planning to kill you anyway.” He looked at Alana, “Both of you.” “You will try,” Alana said bending her knees. In a blur of blue, she lunged forward, followed closely by Luke. Ren raised his hands and shook his head. Alana felt a ripple in the Force around her and before she could counteract his attack, she was sent soaring backwards through the air with a scream. Hard rock collided with her body and her head snapped back, the base of her skull crashing into the stone obelisk. Her vision darkened and she slid down, falling face first into the black sand. Luke held up his sword, just a lightning crackled through the air towards him, from the ends of his opponent’s fingers. His lightsaber’s green hue brightened as it absorbed the dark energy, and he circled around Ren. “Your powers will only serve to exhaust you, Ben. Face me!” With a gut wrenching yell, Kylo activated his lightsaber and lunged forward, locking blades with his former master. “I hate you!” he yelled pivoting and swinging around only to have his sword glance off of Luke’s. They faced each other, sidestepping into a circle. “You’re lost Ben! Snoke has lied to you!” The boy snarled, “You left me there to die! YOU’RE THE ONE WHO LIED TO ME!” Raising his arms above his head he jumped forward and brought the blade down. At the last second Luke bent his knee and brought his sword up, sparks flying from where they clashed. His attacker pushed his weight down, and Luke groaned as he tried to hold his ground. A shadowy figure moved to his left running towards them. Vmmmm! Blue light exploded in his eyes as Alana swung her sword up between them, kicking Ren in the side, sending him stumbling back. Luke cried out and fell forward, covering his eyes as they burned in their sockets. Everything became a blur as he scrambled back. Red and blue light moved away from him closer to the black silhouetted of the obelisk. He tried to see more and rose to his feet, but they were only simple blurbs fighting their way across his vision. He was useless now. Gritting her teeth, Alana flipped back and landed next to the obelisk, luring Ren closer in. She stepped away from him, her back pressing against the cold stone. “You have nowhere to go,” he taunted, as he marched through the dust stirred up from their battle. “Ack!” she gasped as he swung at her. Turning around she gripped the hilt of her sword with both hands and leaned forward as he locked with her again. Luke’s silhouetted moved behind his right ear and she looked into Ben’s eyes, “Neither do you.” Raising her leg, she planted her foot in the center of his chest and gave a hard kick. With and “oomph” he sprawled back landing on the ground with a thud. Alana looked to Luke, “The detonator! Now!” Luke closed his eyes and pulled the cylinder from his pocket. His finger flipped back the cap and he set his thumb against the button. Alana’s voice yelled his name telling him to do it. “I’m sorry.” With a beep, the charges set against the obelisk exploded, and great cracks opened in the earth beneath their feet. Alana stumbled to the side as Ben tried to scramble away. The ground began to tilt and her stomach flipped as gravity took over. Soon she lost sight of the man she had been fighting moments before as smoke and dust filled the air. A great hole tore open and the slab of earth they had been standing on tilted up. With a scream she clawed at the ground, trying to stay upright. The sand slipped through her fingers and she looked down at the maw below her, readying to swallow her whole. Soon she fell into the darkness, alone and afraid. Again… Chapter 15 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “ Hah! ” her lungs burned as she inhaled, pebbles and dirt falling on her face. Everything was pitch black, and her gasps echoed off the rock surrounding her. Groaning she sat up, and reached down, the hilt of her saber still latched to her belt. Rolling onto her knees she held her arm above her head and switched the blade on, its blue light a beacon in the dark. She looked around, waving her sword in the air, trying to see. It was a large cavern was all she could tell, large stones and rubble surrounded her from the explosion. Whatever Luke had wanted from down here was buried beneath tons of rock and dirt. Panting she stood up, kicking small rocks down from the hill of debris she was on, the clattering sound echoing around her. Crouching down she moved down the side of the pile slowly, her entire body aching with every move. Blue light followed her as she took a deep breath and jumped to the next ledge. “ Oomph .” Wiping her face she looked around and squinted through the darkness, turning her sword off. A pinhole of light came from far away directly in front of her. Hacking into her arm she limped towards the light, taking it a step at a time as her body objected with each movement. “Ali.” She stopped. A ragged breath echoed around her and she was unsure if it was her own or---. Keep moving , she told herself. Holding her side she took a step forward. Something warm and wet closed around her ankle. “Ali---.” Raising her hand she activated her saber and looked down. Brown eyes mixed with the green light, and squinted up at her. Blood and dirt covered his skin and his chest rose and fell quickly. Ren let go of her ankle as she knelt next to him, “Ben---.” “Of course you get out with nothing but a couple cuts and bruises,” he hissed as he tried to sit up, but Alana pushed him back down, her eyes staring at the lower half of his body. His legs were crushed and hidden beneath a pile of rock, too big to move by hand. “Well, I was always better at paying attention to my surroundings than you were,” she said moving down to get a better look at his legs. She swallowed the bile that threatened to spill into her mouth and moved back up to face him, “Just hold on. I’m going to get you out of here.” Twisting around she set her lightsaber aside, letting it light up the area around them, and she stood up, holding her hands out towards the rocks. A low pitched hum filled the air, and the rocks crushing him began to move. The ground shook beneath them and Ben screamed in pain as his body moved. A deep rumble blew through the cavern and Alana grit her teeth. “Stop!” Ben yelled. Falling to her knees Alana let the rock fall back into place. “Just stop,” he rasped, “You’ll bring it all down on us.” He turned his head to the side and breathed heavily. Alana breathed in gulps of air and laid down on her side, staring at his face. “Just leave,” he whispered. “No,” she answered sitting up on her knees. His blood covered hand rested on her thigh and she stared down at him. “No, I’m not leaving you here.” “Just kill me or go. It’s what I would---.” “I know exactly what you would do ,” she hissed as she undid her belt. “You would leave me here. You wouldn’t kill me, you wouldn’t help me, you’d just leave. You might even say something about how weak I must be, because I couldn’t save myself,” she spat as she wrapped the belt above his knee, and cinched it tight. Ben’s back arched and he screamed out in pain. Alana wiped her face, and moved on to the other leg, “But you would have left me here to die.” Gritting her teeth she tugged on the belt, cutting off blood supply to his crushed legs. “You had Luke blow the charges, you obviously meant to kill me then. Yet now you hesitate. Why?” he ground out as she sat back on her heels. Blue eyes stared at him in the darkness, “Because I’m too weak to kill you myself.” She shook her head and tilted her chin back with a dark chuckle, “And I’m okay with that.” “What are you doing?” He wheezed, trying to sit up. Alana didn’t look at him as she walked over to where her lightsaber laid on the ground picking it up she walked back over to him. His eyes stared at her in terror, “No—no. You aren’t---.” “You’ll die if I don’t do this.” She bit her lip and knelt down, “We can fix your legs, but I have to get us out of here if there’s any hope of doing that.” She looked at the blue blade, “The sword will cauterize the wound and help keep you from bleeding out. Ben, it’s your only chance.” “Just kill me,” he spat, sitting up on his elbows with a glare. “This will change nothing. I’m still going to kill you.” She lowered her gaze, “You have a real way with the ladies, Ben.” Snapping her head up she shook her head and reached down ripping off the leather straps on the tops of her boots. “Bite down.” Ben’s breathing picked up as bit down on the strips of black leather, and he laid down and closed his eyes. Alana took a deep breath and wiped the tears running down her cheeks as she moved down to his knees. She let all the air out of her lungs, and fought the need to vomit. Defending herself and maiming her attacker was one thing, but this… holding the hilt of her lightsaber with both hands she lined it up just below his knees. Her hands shook and she closed her eyes gripping the hilt tight in her left hand and letter her other hand drop to her side. She did her best to sob silently, trying not to distress the man next to her. Something gripped her left wrist and she looked down, Ben’s black gloved hand gripping hers. He breathed through his nose, “Do it.” Gripping his hand tight she looked away and brought her blade down, severing skin, muscle and cutting through bone. “AAARGH!!!” Alana threw her saber to the side, leaving them in complete as Ben writhed next to her screaming in pain. She tried to hold him down. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!” she cried as he choked in the shock and pain. His hand crushed hers in a bruising grip but she didn’t care. “It’s over now, you’re free, I swear that’s the worst, that’s the worst.” She pushed his hair back, as he cried out into the darkness, “I’m so sorry,” she whispered over and over and over again, like a mantra. His body shook next to her as he breathed through his nose and around the leather jammed between his teeth. He closed his eyes, still moaning and writhing on the ground. Alana sat back and sobbed leaning against the rock he had just been trapped beneath. His hand trembled in hers as they stayed there. “Ben?” No answer. Moving across the ground she put her hand on the center of his chest, feeling him breathe. Reaching up she pulled the quickly made mouth guard from his mouth. “You never came back,” he whispered. Alana stared through the darkness, and closed her eyes. He said it again, “You didn’t try to find me. Why?” “Because you found me. When you destroyed the Academy.” He shook his head, “That was months--- two years after you left me with the First Order. You forgot about me.” Alana shook her head, “No. Ben I’ve done many things but I never forgot about you.” Both of his hands found hers in the darkness, and he shuddered, “I want to go home.” Alana bit her lip as he whispered, “I don’t want to die here, I don’t want to be alone.” She wiped her face on her sleeve and looked up, spying that pinhole of light again. “Ali?” chuckling sadly she squeezed his hand. “No one calls me that anymore,” she whispered. “It’s because you’ve gotten so old.” Nodding her head she held out her hand and pulled her lightsaber to her, letting its light shine in the darkness, “If I’m old then so are you.” Standing up she set the saber on top of the rock and then crouched down, “Come on, sit up.” Holding his arms she pulled him up, doing her best to ignore his groans of pain. “Shit,” he hissed as she looked down, and took his right arm. “This isn’t going to be comfortable, but trust me, it’s the only way we’re getting you out of here.” Draping his arm over her shoulder she pressed against him and ducked her head against his chest. He groaned as she slipped her right hand between his thighs and hefted him up, slinging him over her shoulders. Panting she stood straight and grabbed his right hand with hers. Ben cried out as she moved her shoulders, jostling him and she winced, “Sorry.” ****************************************************************************** After walking forever the light became brighter and closer and the cavern became smaller and smaller until they were moving through a tunnel. This shouldn’t be here, she thought. Alana peered up ahead, “I can see the mouth of the cave Ben, we’re almost there.” Ben moaned against her sore shoulder, but didn’t move. The sound of ship engines came from outside and Alana stopped. “Luke.” Crouching down she set Ben against the wall. His eyes were closed and he winced at he settled against the rock. Alana tried to stand, but he caught ahold of her tunic weakly. “Don’t go.” She shook her head, “I’ll be right back.” She pulled away from him and limped down the tunnel, disappearing in the bright light. Ren rested against the cold stone behind him, “—Lana…” ****************************************************************************** Alana held her hand out and used the wall for support as she climbed up to the surface. Dust blew around her feet as she took a deep breath and ran out of the tunnel. “Luke,” she rasped, covering her face as wind and sand barraged her skin. Lights shined in the black sand storm and she moved forward. “Show us your hands!” a voice yelled. The sound of a blaster was muffled by the wind, as Alana turned to the side, and fell to her knees, too exhausted to fight back. Encased in white armor a squad of storm troopers ran towards her and she turned, and scrambled back for the cave. “Stun her!” ****************************************************************************** He was alone, always alone. She’s never coming back. Opening his mouth his stared up at the ceiling. The light was so close, he could almost touch it. Just a few more steps, and they could have walked in it together. She left you in the dark again. Just like she did before. You’re nothing to her. Ren’s vision blurred and he turned his head to the side, as shadows moved at the mouth of the cave. He could see long red hair and a thin figure moving towards him at a break neck pace, “Ali.” Black gloved hands cupped his cheeks and he looked up as someone knelt down next to him. His eyelids closed as he was too weak to keep them open. “Kylo? Lord Ren?” Notes: Thoughts? Suggestions, irrational need to rant or theories? Comment below and don't forget that little kudos button. I appreciate it!!! ;) Chapter 16 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Thunder clapped overhead as Poe ducked beneath the wing of the x-wing. Rain pattered on the tarps above his head and he set the lantern to the side. Pushing back his hood he picked up the hydrospanner and made his way to the undercarriage of the ship. He opened the panel and began to work, pushing aside wires and unscrewing the cap off the regulator. “Hey BB-8 hand me the jumper bypass, will you?” A round ended tool popped up next to him and he shook his head, “No the--- Finn?” The young man wiped the water running down his face and stepped back, “Figured you could use some company.” Sitting up, Poe wiped his hands with an old rag and stood, “What about the General?” Finn laughed and shrugged, “She’s playing dejarik with Chewie. She’s beating him, so I thought I’d get out of there before he pulled my arms out of my sockets.” They laughed as thunder shook the skies again. Sitting down on an old stump, Poe raked his fingers through his hair and sighed, “Heard anything from Rey?” “No,” Finn sighed, as he looked down and clasped his hands in his lap. “It’s been a day,” Poe said looking over his shoulder where the falcon had been sitting just the day before, “If they aren’t back tomorrow, Luke ordered us to leave.” The ex-storm trooper scowled, “What? No we can’t just leave, what about Rey?” Poe shook his head, “Luke trained on this planet, you didn’t grow up hearing the stories but I did. The great Luke Skywalker seeking out an ancient Jedi Master on Dagobah. If the First Order is looking for us this is where they’ll come first.” Finn started to argue but Poe cut him off, “If Luke and Rey are still alive and they miss the deadline, they won’t come back here Finn. They’ll go to the Outer Rim, where we are supposed to be. ” He set his jaw, “If you want to see your girlfriend again, I suggest we follow Master Skywalker’s orders.” “Oh, so now you follow orders?” Finn asked. Poe shrugged, “Only when they make sense.” “And sending the only three Jedi left in the galaxy to go find some secret temple makes sense?” Finn snorted and crossed his arms, “I don’t trust Alana. She’d sell them out the second things went south.” “She’s not that bad.” “She’s abrasive.” “And Rey isn’t?” Finn shook his head and stared up at the tarp, “Rey… once you get to know her she’s more…” “If you start going all starry eyes about your girl on me, I might hit you over the head with this hydrospanner,” Poe joked with a silly grin. Finn held his hands up, “All I’m saying is, Rey isn’t mean just for the sake of being cruel.” Poe cocked his head, “Alana isn’t what I would call an especially warm person, but---.” “And you got that after spending just a couple of hours with her?” Finn asked sarcastically. Poe shook his head and opened his mouth to defend his thinking but stopped as a small ball sped through the rain towards them, screaming over the wind. “ B-b-pth-oooo!” BB-8 tweeted as it rolled to a stop next to Poe. He frowned and stood as the wind picked up and the tarp over the x-wing went taut. Engines roared overhead and he turned around as the Falcon let down its landing gear and set down in the middle of a great bug patch of mud. Finn moved past him and ran towards the ship as the ramp opened. Two figures came down, the larger one leaning on what he assumed was Rey. With water splashing around his feet with every step, Poe joined Finn and took a hold of Luke, helping him down the ramp. The turned his head, unable to see through the bloody bandages around his eyes. The old man limped with every step, and eventually they made their way into the Seruna . As they moved into the main hold, Leia stood up from the table and ran over to them. “What happened?” “Kylo fucking Ren happened,” Rey hissed, sitting down as they set Luke on the couch. Finn straightened up in alarm and moved closer to her subconsciously. “You fought him?” She shook her head, “Luke had me take the Falcon and fall into orbit of the asteroid field. When I didn’t hear from him and Alana I went back to the planet and found this,” she said throwing her had towards Luke in exhaustion, “And no Alana. Just a crater.” Poe stepped aside as Leia tended to her brother, “You mean she’s---?” “Dead,” Rey answered flatly, leaning against Finn’s body, as her own began to shut down in need of sleep. “No,” Luke murmured and caught Leia’s hands as she began to unwrap his bandages. “No-no, not dead. Worse.” ****************************************************************************** Pain. Pain. Pain. Pain! That is his world now. The pain in his side the pain where his legs once were. Pain and the screeching sound of the medi-droids tearing open his wounds in the name of healing him. Sharp needles prodded his skin, scalpels cut away necrotic flesh while drills connect the bones with rods of steel. There were no drugs to dull the pain, no words to ease his torment. This was his punishment, he realized when he was given a moment’s respite. His failure, his weakness had earned him his pain. He was tied down and completely conscious as the First Order gave him back his legs. Then, when the pain became too much, and his vision filled with the white lights hanging above him, it finally stopped. The drills quieted. The sounds of his screams echoing off the metal walls ceased and the metal table he was on began it’s slow rotation until he was standing upright. Heels clacked on the floor softly and he opened his eyes, “Mari.” “Good to see you too, my Lord,” she said with just a touch of snarkiness in her voice. Her cap was pulled forward, and her hair was pulled back into a tight bun. “Alana---.” “The Jedi is alive. She’s being interrogated as we speak. She will pay dearly for what she did to you,” Mari murmured looking him up and down, her eyes travelling slowly over his legs. Stepping closer she cocked her head and stared him in the eye, “I thought I’d leave her death to you.” Ren stared over her head at the great mirror behind her, “We’re on Vjunn?” “Yes.” “And the Supreme Leader?” Mari narrowed her eyes, “He knows you are here but nothing more. I dispatched our escort shortly after we arrived.” Reaching down she undid the cuffs around his hands. “You and I are the only ones here.” She glanced back up at his face and frowned. His eyes stared through her and she clenched her jaw, “And the Jedi.” “Take me to her.” “You need to rest,” she said shaking her head. Looking down Ren reached to the side and tried to take a step forward, but his knees buckled in pain and he stumbled forward. With a sigh, Mari caught him, her cold hands snaking their way around his bare waist. “Take. Me. To. Her.” He stared down at her, his lips parted as he gasped for air as pain raced up from his legs. She stared up at him, “As you wish.” Notes: I tried to bring the original TFA characters back into the story, since Awakening mentioned it, even though I really, really, really want to just focus on Ben and the OFCs. I totally ship Rey and Finn, but I kind of suck at writing them, but I'll work on that and try to make them a bigger deal in this fic. Still not sure what I'm going to do with Poe (Would love some feedback on that storyline!) And Vjunn (May sound familiar if you're a geek like me and actually played SW games growing up) is the planet they're on right now is where Darth Vader's secret getaway supposedly is if you still count the video game Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. Working on the follow-up chapter right now. Should have it out before midnight. Chapter 17 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “It’s not fair,” Ben says as he sits back on her bed, and watches her pack her things into a small backpack. His hair is shorter, cut over his ears with the sides shaved close, but still jet black against his skin, and his scar is nonexistent. She stops and looks at him, “You’ll get your turn next year.” “You only say that because you’re already a knight,” he mutters. His mouth screws up into a disappointed line and he hands her the leather bound journal she had kept since she was eight. “At least tell me where you’re going,” he says pressing her for information he already knows the answer to. “I told you, Ben, I can’t,” she says packing the book away, “Luke wants the mission kept classified.” “Oh come on,” he says sitting up, “Me knowing what system you’re going to isn’t going to hurt anything.” He catches her by the hand and she stops, her favorite scarf wrapped in their hands, “You can trust me, but I just--- I need to know, Ali.” He stares up at her with those dark, rich brown eyes, with tiny fleck of gold around the pupil. His hand squeezes hers and she looks down. “You aren’t as cute as you think you are,” she whispers. He smiles, “So you think I’m cute?” The sounds of his laughter echo off the walls as she slaps the back of his head. She smiles and shakes her head before leaning down and whispering in his ear. “Castell.” He frowned and leaned back to get a better look of her face, “The Colonies?” “Shhhh!” she hissed pressing her fingers to her lips as someone walks down the hall outside her door. “You can’t tell anyone,” she whispered. Reaching up he pulls her fingers away from his mouth, “I won’t.” Sitting down she looks at him sadly, “I’m gonna miss you, Ben.” “Sure you are,” he drawls rolling his eyes, “You’re going to go explore the galaxy and forget about me.” “I’ll be back before you know it,” she laughs and hits his arm, “Maybe you’ll finally get the bantha balls to talk to Ko while I’m gone.” His nose scrunches and he shakes his head as she giggles, “Oh, come on she’s cute.” “And mean as a Kowakian monkey-lizard.” She cocks her head and frowns, “I guess she does have the hair for it.” They look at each other and burst out laughing. “Oh, Force, I wish you could come with me,” she says still laughing. They look at each other, their laughter dying down. And she looks down her hand still encased in his. He tilts his chin up and cups her cheek with his free hand. She looks down at him from beneath long black eyelashes as he pulls her down closer and closer to his lips, “Ben…” Knock-Knock. Alana lurches back and they each stand, avoiding one another’s gaze as a young padawan sticks their head in the door. The young girl looks between them then focuses on her quarry, “Alana, Luke wants to see you. He said it’s time.” Swallowing hard, she nods her head and picks up her bag and starts for the door, not looking at Ben as he starts to follow her. The youngling holds out her hand and shakes her head, “He only asked for her.” Ben stops, and Alana can feel his eyes boring into her back. With a small nod she dismisses the child and turns around, “I guess this is it,” she murmurs. She stares down at his black boots and he clears his throat. “Yeah, I um---.” Alana hid a small smile as a blush creeped up his cheeks. Shaking her head she slaps him on the arm. “You’re supposed to tell me good luck and all that crap, dumbass. Force, you’re bad at goodbyes.” Ben raises his head and laughs, “You’ll do great.” His eyes soften as he stares at her, “I know it.” She purses her lips, “Of course I will, I’m a Kenobi remember?” “And no one will ever let you forget it,” he says nodding his head, “Now go, before Luke starts to think you jumped ship.” Smiling she reaches up and gives him a quick hug, doing her best to ignore the awkwardness as he closes his arms around her. She takes a deep breath, lets him go and then turns for the door, “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!” Ben sticks his head out the door after her, “Of course I won’t. I’m the good one remember?” Notes: Short chapter, even for me, but I need to go to bed. If you've read any of my other fics, you know I love flashbacks and dreams, but I'm trying to keep from using them too much in this fic. BUT now I feel like its a good time to use them, so expect a few more chapters like this spread throughout the story. Chapter 18 Half-way through Bast castle, he found his legs. Looking down at his feet, he pushed Mari away from him, and tried walking on his own. One step, then another, and another after that and he was moving on his own. With a shuddering breath he straightened his back and walked on without her---. “Blast it,” he hissed as he caught himself on the wall, his lower extremities feeling as though they were being torn anew. He leaned against the wall as Mari moved towards him. “Kylo.” “Don’t,” he ordered as she tried to lay a hand on his forearm, “I can walk on my own. I’m not weak.” Straightening up he held his breath and turned down the hall again. Pain makes me stronger, he chanted in his mind with every step. ***************************************************************************** Her screams cut off as the IT-O Droid retracted its instruments from her skin. The only sound left as it hovered back into it recharge station, were her exhausted sobs of pain. The guards had left her there for two days, naked and at the mercy of the interrogation droid. Her head hung between her arms which were pulled up by rusty old chains, the tips of her toes just barely dragging across the cold, blood covered floor as she swung slightly from left to right. Two beams of light crossed from the windows above blinding her eyes. Pain is relative, she told herself, This is nothing, it does not change me, it will not break me. And even though she repeated that in her mind the truth was that it hurt, but it was nothing compared to the pain she had gone through before. The droid had reopened the old scars on her back, but the tissue was so twisted and the nerves so gnarled she felt nothing. When the droid decided she was unfazed by its scalpels and burn torches it had moved on to other parts of her body. Her fingers and toes were attacked first, the skin burnt and the bones broken. Then it drugged her and began to ask a series of questions she neither understood nor cared to answer. She only repeated a single line with every sting, every prod, and every cut. ****************************************************************************** Ren panted as he leaned against the observation window as the IT-O droid moved away from its charging station completely reinvigorated. Alana glanced up at it as it oved around her and began to recite her name age and rank. “Alana Kenobi. A-l-a-n-a K-e-n-o-b-i. Age twenty six. Jedi fucking Knight of the New fucking Order.” Mari cut off the intercom next to him as the interrogation droid zapped her quickly then asked another question. Kylo’s eyes fell to his hands. He’s walking down an unfamiliar tunnel, no guards, no cameras, just him. He can hear her screaming, begging her captors to stop, to just let her go. He runs forward, and holds his hands out in front of him, focusing on the door. With a groan he pushes against it with the Force as he draws closer, willing it to move out of his way and let him in. It does. The door creaks open and the guard inside turns around just as blue light cuts the man in half. He wipes his face, smearing the blood spatter across his skin and looks up. Alana’s hanging by her arms, her back to him covered in open streaks of blood and flesh. Reaching up he swipes at the links holding her in the air, and deactivates his saber as she falls into his arms. Her eyes are half closed, and he can tell that for a second she doesn’t recognize him as he lowers her to the floor. “Ali, it’s me, it’s Ben.” Her eyebrows furrow and she reaches up, with bandaged covered fingers and runs them through his hair, that’s grown down to his shoulders in the half year they’ve been apart. “No, no, no, Ben you can’t be here,” she cries as she tries to push against him. He grabs her arms, “It’s alright, I’m going to get you out of here.” Quickly he rises to his feet and tries to pull her with him, but she shakes him off, slipping on the blood soaked floor. “No! I have to stay I have to finish---.” “Alana,” he hisses starting for her, ready to drag her off the ship if he has to. Then he stops. They both stop. Heavy footsteps sound outside the cell and he turns around just as someone in shining armor lets off a stun round into his chest. Convulsing, he falls to the ground, her voice screaming his name. “Ben---!” “Ren?” Mari’s voice called to him from the side and he opened his eyes. “Cut her down.” She looked at him in awestruck confusion, “My lord, she’s a Jedi---!” “Cut her down or I’ll string you up in her place!” They stared at each other, his face seething, hers dumbstruck. Setting her jaw she walked over to the console and recalled the droid, sending it to its compartment, then releasing Alana from her shackles. He looked back through the window as she fell to the ground with a cry, and laid on her side, her back to them. “Open the door,” he ordered. Mari flicked the switch with a glare and kicked out her hip, “ Yes sir. ” Two breaths later he stood in front of the door, “Get out.” The woman gave no reply and simply walked out the door, her anger spilling over to him through the Force. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he went inside. Alana didn’t move, even when his boots squelched as he walked through pools of blood to stand in front of her. Her blue eyes cut through the light and she squinted up at him. Blood dripped from her mouth. “You’re taller,” she chuckled weakly. “New legs.” Her eyes fell and she rolled onto her back. “When you said you’d kill me if I cut off your legs, I thought you meant it would be immediate. I guess I was wrong. Snoke has his claws in you deep if you would be willing to do this to anyone, especially me Ben.” He shook his head, “I didn’t know, I gave no orders.” Alana narrowed her eyes, “Stop lying and just kill me. It’s been a long time coming so---,” she swallowed and closed her eyes, “If you could just get it over with, I’d really appreciate it.” Footsteps thudded next to her and she turned her head away from him, refusing to look at him. “Ben--- Ah!” A soft invisible force wrapped itself around her like a cool satin sheet and her stomach knotted up as she was lifted off the ground. Her eyes flew open and she looked at him, his left hand held out to her, his eyes focused on her, and his other hand waiting for her. Slowly he moved forward and caught her in his arm, “I’m not going to kill you.” Her lips twitched and she chuckled, then groaned as he carried her to the door, “Why not? Can’t live without me?” **************************************************************************** “Blast it,” he hissed as he sat down, his legs crying out in pain as they bent. He glanced up, Alana in the blue bacta tank, her red hair floating around her as she slept and healed. “I told you that you needed to rest and heal,” Mari murmured as she strolled into the room. Kylo watched as she came to a stop in front of the tank. “I see you’ve made a new friend.” He glared at her as she turned around and she returned it with one of her own, “What was you told me? You don’t need my loyalty, or my love, just my fear? Is it the same for her?” she asked nodding to Alana. Looking down he rubbed his palms against the tops of his thighs trying to dull the ache, “It’s none of your business.” “Your business is my business,” she hissed in disgust. “If the Supreme Leader discovers that you’ve gone soft---.” “I haven’t gone soft,” he spat, raising his head. Mari shook her head. “You think you’re the only one he’ll flay alive when this gets out? He’ll kill you, me, and even though I could care less I know you do, he’ll kill her.” Standing up he shook his head, “You don’t know what you’re talking about— gah!” A sharp pain cut through his right knee and he lurched to the left, grabbing ahold of a small table, throwing the metal pan of instruments to the ground. Mari appeared next to him and caught him. “What would you do without me?” she chuckled. His head snapped up, and her smirk disappeared. A growl thundered through his chest as he pushed her away, “I don’t need your help.” She stumbled back and frowned, “Would you prefer her attention? What can she give you that I can’t. I understand you, she doesn’t know the real you---.” “You’re replaceable,” he said cutting her off, “You’re nothing to me.” Her hand slipped from his and he watched as she took another step back as he fell to his knees, “Fine, but don’t think I will be there alongside you when the Supreme Leader takes your head because of your weakness and stupidity.” Tossing her hair back she stalked out of the room leaving him on the floor. Ren stared at the floor before, attempting to stand up. The gears in his new legs whirred and his knees screamed in pain, but eventually he was upright. Panting he limped his way across the room, and came to a stop in front of Alana’s tank, “I’m not weak.” Chapter 19 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Alana’s pain melted away and for the first time in days, she dreamed again. “Peace is a lie,” she says in unison with the other ten students behind her, “There is only passion. Though passion I gain strength. Through strength, I gain power. Through power, I gain victory.” Taking a breath she glances over her shoulder and looks at Ben. Like the other teens he is kneeling on the ground and his eyes are boring into hers, his hands clenched into fists on his lap. Turning around she finishes the code, “Through victory, my chains are broken. The Force shall free me.” The overly tall creature pacing in front of them stops in front of her and grabs her by the chin, digging its claws into her skin. She can hear Ben hiss behind her, but holds her hand out to him, Don’t . You’ll just make it worse, Ben, she thinks. No other sounds come from behind her and she turns around to face the alien instructor. Large completely white eyes stare into hers as the instructor lets her go, “Your leader is unfocused,” it tells the other students, “Repeat the code for her.” “Peace is a lie, there is only passion. Through passion…” ************************************************************************************* A green light filled her vision as she woke up, her body sore but painless as she turned onto her side, sliding against the smooth black sheets beneath her. She sat up on her elbow and pulled the top sheet up over her naked chest, as she took in the large bed. It was a dark room, great in space but lacking in furniture and other commodities. Huge windows spanned the far wall, where hazy green light filtered in from the dark outer world. “Sleep well?” Something moved in the shadows to her left and she spun around, pulling her legs up as she scrambled back on the bed. “Ben.” Slowly a scar torn face came into view. With a slight groan she pushed her shoulders back, “How long was I out?” “A few days.” He stopped a few feet away from the bed, “Are you in pain?” “Do you really care?” she spat. He leveled his gaze and straightened his back, “No.” “Then don’t ask what you don’t want to know.” They stared at each other for a few moments before his eyes traveled down her body and she gripped the sheets tighter and pulled them up further. She looked away from him, “Where are we?” He looked around the room, “Vijjun, my grandfather’s fortress.” Alana flinched and looked down, “And why are we here?” Brown eyes settled on her again, “Because it’s mine now. No one enters without my knowing, and no one leaves without getting past me.” She snorted, “I like my inheritance better.” “Your grandfather’s ship,” he said nodding his head, “I thought you would have scrapped it and sold it for spare parts.” She shrugged and glared at him, “That was the plan. Then someone decided to destroy my life. It came in handy the last time we saw one another.” Ren set his jaw, “Whatever Luke told you was a lie, you and I have no reason to fight one another.” “Oh really? What would your father say to that?” Alana shook her head as he looked away, clearly thrown off balance by her words. “Killing Han Solo was necessary.” “You can’t say it, can you? You can’t even call him your dad, you sick bastard.” “You weren’t there!” he shouted, his hands shaking as spittle spewed from his lips, “You have no idea what it was---!” Alana jumped up and sat on her knees, the sheets still wrapped around her body, “You murdered your own father, Ben!” He turned around and stared out the window, pressing his hands to his head, “I thought it would end it,” he whispered. The woman behind him sat back down and cocked her head, “End what?” “The… pain, the guilt.” Ever so slowly he twisted around letting his hands fall to his sides, “I just wanted to stop feeling .” “Ben…” she whispered sadly. Slowly she stood up off the bed, pulling the sheets with her like a long train. Fabric rustled as she walked to him, “Did it work?” He stared down at her, as she stopped right in front of him, his lips parted and quivering. She cupped his cheek in her right palm and he let out a shuddering breath, “No.” She stared up at him, her face showing her hesitation, “Then what do you feel? Tell me.” Looking down he laid his hand over hers, “I can’t sleep. I don’t eat. Every part of my body feels as though it’s being torn apart. I---I’m afraid. I’m weak, Alana.” “What are you afraid of?” He froze, his eyes focused on her mouth. She leaned forward and gasped as his hand gripped her by the nape of her neck, not enough to hurt but enough to urge her closer to him, so that she was pressed to his chest, “I’m afraid you’re going to leave me again.” She stared up at him wide eyed, and speechless. Slowly, he leaned down, his lips pressing against hers softly. Her free hand thudded against his chest and he broke away and leaned back up, her eyes still open and watching him, “Ben?” “I have loved you since---.” “No, please stop,” she begged, trying to break out of his embrace, tears running down her face. He tightened his grip. “Alana, I love you.” “We can’t---.” “Ali---.” “No!” she cried, finally breaking free, “You never said anything about this before. You’re lying. You’re trying to manipulate me---- to hurt me again.” His left arm hung in the air in front of his chest and he shook his head, “Why do you think I followed you to the First Order? Why do you think I stayed when they captured us both? I could have run, I could have left you there---.” “We were friends,” she said shaking her head quickly, trying to persuade herself, “You’re like a br---.” “I’m not a brother to you,” he said, swiping his hand through the air, “I---.” “Why are you telling me this now!?” She yelled, “Why didn’t you tell me before? I don’t believe you.” Her body shook and she collapsed back on the bed. Moving quickly he strode across the room and knelt in front of her, taking her face in his hands. “I can give you anything. I---.” She reached up and gripped his hands, “Ben, you don’t know me. I’ve changed.” “So have I, but I would do anything for you,” he whispered. Pulling her down, he kissed her, crashing their lips together. Her left hand dropped and gripped his robe. Turning her head to the side, she let out a moan as he moved across her skin, down her neck and across her clavicle. He right hand let go of the sheets wrapped around her and they collapsed, exposing more skin. Closing her eyes, she laid back as he made his way down her body, the both of them bathed in the soft green light of Vijjun’s waning sun. Notes: KAY FIRST OFF: I accidentally posted a scene in theist chapter that is supposed to happen a few chapters from now. I've edited it out but I think about eight people read it before I did so, therefore you may wish to reread the chapter before this. Also there is a sex scene that's going to go with this chapter but I'm too tired to right anything sexy right now. It will probably be woven into the next couple of chapters with some flashbacks from both of them. Would love to know what you think? Was it too soon to have them get together or what? Do you think they should stay together or go their separate ways? Comment, Kudos, and share below Chapter 20 “Alana, I love you.” Mari froze as the muffled confessions of Ren echoed out into the hallway. Holding her breath she stepped closer to the door the room inside, silent like a grave. “Why are you telling me this now!” the Jedi’s voice yelled, and Mari flinched as a soft thud carried to her ears. A few seconds later, Kylo’s voice murmured, “I can give you anything---.” Pushing herself away from the door Mari shook her head. “You idiot.” Stepping back, she ran down the hall. ************************************************************************************ His hot hands wrapped themselves around her as she moved back on the bed, her legs open and around him as she tried to stay upright. Her fingers framed his face as her lips slowly escaped his. He stopped. Her left thumb ran across his cheek, following his scar all the way down to his jaw. Leaning back he grabbed her hand, “Does it bother you?” Her lips part as she breathes in and his voice echoes in her mind. She’s reaching up to the ceiling, the joints in her arms and legs cracking from being hunched over all morning reciting that damn code. She just wants to be… “HAUGH!” she groans as her back cries out in pain and hunches over again, trying to make it stop. “Does it bother you?” She turns around, wincing at the twinge in her back from the movement, “What?” He’s staring at her from the cell’s entrance, black shadows hiding his eyes, “Your back, does it bother you?” ***************** Shaking her head, Alana looked up at the Ben in front of her, “No.” Brown eyes stared into ones as blue as the Man’aan sea and he leaned forward, tilting her body back onto the bed as he kissed her softly. She closed her eyes as he turned his head, changing the angle and whispered his name, “Ben , mmmmmm…” On their own her hands traveled over his chest, searching for a set of buttons or zippers that would let her pull his blasted shirt off. She let out a gasp as he pushed her down, and she wrapped her arms around the back of his neck. Releasing her lips from his he moved down her naked body, and she finally found the buttons she had been searching for on his back. Quickly, she sat up and ripped them open, not caring about his stupid uniform. His head snapped up, and he set his hands on top of her legs, watching her with slight amusement. Alana shook her head, and reached down, pulling the tunic over his head. His black hair fell over his brow as the smooth material ran over his face and he reached up pushing the tendrils back, so he could see. He looked up at her, her eyes staring at his torso. His breathing hitched as she pressed her hand to his side, tracing the long scar that wrapped around his abdomen. Then she raised her other hand and laid it atop the scars on his shoulders, collarbones, and ribs. He cocked his head, “We both have our scars.” Her hand fell and she stared at the center of his chest. With a soft rustle he moved closer and rubbed his hands up and down her arms, “What’s wrong? You’re trembling. Slowly he moved closer, running his fingers through her hair, and cupping her cheek. She reached out and gripped his arm tightly, her nails biting into his skin. Leaning forward she rested her head against his chest. “This is a mistake,” she whispered. “Alana…” he peered down at her and set his free hand on her waist, “We can be together now. You and I, we’re the same.” She shook her head and pursed her lips, “No, we’re not.” She pushed back pressing her palm against his chest to keep him from moving closer, “I went back to the light, you didn’t.” Her voice broke as she looked up at him, tears streaming down her face, “And I don’t blame you, I know what they did to you, what they made you do, and you were so strong, but---.” Looking down she sobbed, and pressed her hand to her mouth. “But I look at you now and I don’t recognize you. You’ve changed. ” Alana’s shoulders shook, “The things you've done... The man I knew died a long time ago.” His hands fell and he stared at her long and hard. "I---." But she cut him off, her words barely a whisper, "You aren't my Ben." He tried to move back but she framed his face with her hands, “You look like him and you sound like him---,” she looked down and ran her palms over his skin, “God, you feel like him---But that terrifies me because I don’t think that there is any part of you that is still him, no matter how hard I might wish it were true. You wiped it out, you killed yourself.” On that last word she let him go and he fell back, his eyes wide and his jaw clenched tight, too emotional to say anything. Alana crossed one arm over her naked chest and placed her other hand at the small of her throat as she pressed her back against the headboard, “What I remember and what I see don’t match up anymore. I remember a little boy who would climb onto the roof of the academy with me every night just to watch the stars, and I remember a young man who---,” she gave a choked laugh and looked down, “Who climbed and squeezed his way through the ventilation shafts, just to sneak into my room and hold me the night Luke told me my mother died.” Her hands shook and Kylo stared at her, his own body feeling less grounded and unsteady. Pushing back her hair she looked into his eyes and whispered, “I remember a man who followed me across the galaxy with the entire Jedi Order chasing after him, just to save me.” Dropping her hands she looked down and closed her eyes. The bed moved beneath her and she felt his warm skin against hers as he took her hand and pressed it to his chest. His fingers tilted up her chin and she opened her eyes staring into the brown depths of his. She could tell he was in pain, from the way his eyes gleamed in the light, and from the pallor of his skin, and the way his bottom lip trembled, “Alana, I’m still---.” Reaching out she pushed him away and pulled her other hand back as though he had stung her, “Stop. Just… stop.” Alana watched as he stood up from the bed and turned his back on her, “Why?” he asked as he stared out the windows taking in the black rocky expanse. Slowly she stood, grabbing the sheets again to wrap around her body. “I can’t love you,” she shook her head, “I don’t love you.” He twisted around the muscles beneath his skin contracting, tight and taut, “You don’t love me now, but we---.” Raising her chin she stared at him hard, “I will never love you. Not after all you’ve done.” Turning around, he stalked towards her, and she stepped back, preparing to fight him off. Reaching out he held out his hand as though he was gripping a cup. A low hum filled the air, and she choked clawing at her throat. She stumbled back, trying to breathe but the Force constricted around her throat making it impossible. “B—e—nnn!” Suddenly the invisible hand around her throat was gone and she collapsed to the floor, hacking and choking. Sitting up she leaned against the bed, as he stood over her. She looked up at him just before he turned his back on her and left the room, the door slamming and automatically locking behind him. Burying her face in the sheets, Alana sobbed in solitude. ****************************************************************************** Mari sat down in front of the console and pressed her palm to the scanner. A black and red logo flashed across the screen before fading to static. Slowly the screen faded until a pale face appeared. “Where the hell are you?” Hux hissed glancing over his shoulder. “Vijjun. He needed medical attention.” “You’re alone?” She narrowed her eyes, “Not quite. The Jedi is here.” She shook her head, “He didn’t react as I thought he would.” “Get rid of her.” Mari shifted in her seat, “That will be difficult. He doesn’t trust me, and they’re in the middle of---.” Hux glared at her though the screen and his voice dropped lower than she had ever heard it before, and she immediately closed her mouth and he growled, “Why did you even keep her alive?” “I thought I could use her against him, but now he’s taking her in his bed like she’s some---.” “Are you contacting me to give excuses, or usable information? I want those coordinates, Mari.” “I’ll get them, I just---,” she sighed as Hux cut off the transmission, and slumped in the chair, “Need more time.” Chapter 21 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Mari sat up as the sensors on the south side of the castle lit up and flipped the viewer screen on. She cocked her head as Ren stalked down the hall, shirtless, his shoulders tight, his eyes burning. Turning around in her chair she jumped up and stepped out into the hall. She walked down the hall bare foot as she ran down the marble floor. The hall opened up to a great room, with a balcony up above. “Damn it!” Kylo Ren’s voice echoed from above. Looking up she jumped back as a broken table was thrown off the floor above. Pushing her shoulders back she ran up the stair well. He was leaning against the railing, his chest rising and falling heavily as he hung his head. His eyes snapped up and he glared at her, “ What ?” “Are you---?” “What do you care?” he hissed. She took in a deep breath and took a few steps until she was standing beside him. “Do you want to talk about it?” “No.” Narrowing her eyes she leaned against the railing, “Good, because I really do not care.” Slowly he looked up at her and she shrugged, “You don’t need her. She would be easy enough to replace.” “You sound confident,” he murmured. Mari held his gaze, “Love always betrays you. I told you when we first met, I want nothing from you.” Kylo shook his head, “Everyone wants something.” “What does she want?” Mari asked nodding down the hall. Looking over his shoulder, he wrapped his hands around the metal rail, tightly, his knuckles going white. “She doesn’t want me.” “She doesn’t know the real you.” He turned around and stared at her. Slowly, she straightened up, and placed her hand on his arm. “You are Kylo Ren. Not some weak Jedi dog who can’t save himself.” Ren watched her for a moment, “What do you really want from me?” he asked, “I’m curious now.” Mari smirked and moved behind him, dragging her nails over his shoulders, and coming to a stop on the other side of him, “Telling you would make it too easy, don’t you agree?” “Maybe.” Looking down she smiled and took him by the hand, leading him down the hall opposite the one he had just come from, “What are you doing?” he asked. She shrugged as she walked backwards, her eyes focused on his, “You can’t be that stupid, can you?” she asked. With a grin she looked back and kicked open a door, tugging him inside. ****************************************************************************** Alana woke up shivering, the room around her completely dark. Reaching around her on the bed she searched for blankets, anything to help keep her warm in her naked state. The sound of a lock turning drew her attention to the side and she stood up, wrapped in the dark comforter of the bed. “Ben?” Small streams of light entered the room as the door opened. Covering her eyes, Alana moved in front of the door as a small figure, not Ben’s, came into the room. With a whir the overhead lights came on, and she was staring face to face with another woman, with long red hair, dressed in a black uniform. “He’s indisposed at the moment,” the woman said with a small smile. Walking forward she handed a bundle of white to Alana, “I thought you could use some clothes.” Confused Alana took the bundle and turned as the woman walked further into the room. “Who are you?” “Lieutenant Margho, aide to Lord Ren, but you may call me Mari.” Alana looked down at the garment in her hands, “Why---?” Mari turned around and clasped her hands in front of her and smiled knowingly, “We women have to support one another. I figured you would need something to where after your tryst with Ren. I know I did after I spent the night in here.” Looking to the side, Alana brushed her hair off her shoulder, “You and Ben are…” The other woman licked her lips and flipped her hair over her own shoulder, and looked down feigning coyness, “Well… yes, we’re involved. You didn’t know?” Turning around, Alana snorted derisively, and threw the dress on the bed, “That’s perfect.” Mari smirked devilishly as soon as the Jedi turned her back, “It is, isn’t it? You don’t mind do you?” she asked in fake concern, taking a step forward. Alana shook her head. “I don’t care, you can have him, I told him as much anyway. I won’t be here much longer anyway.” “A pity,” Mari said with a sniff as she sauntered forward. With a sigh she sat down on the bed and looked up at Alana, “You have a plan to escape I take it then?” Alana glared at her and said nothing. Crossing her legs and placing her hands one on top of the other on her knee Mari cocked her head, “Perhaps we can help each other.” “Why would you help me?” Alana muttered. “You need a way out of here and I need information---.” “I don’t know anything---,” Alana began but Mari held out her hand and waved for her to stop speaking. “Not from you.” “Who?” Mari shrugged, “The ‘who’ is not your concern, but you can help me.” Gripping the blanket around her Alana seethed, “And if I help you, you’ll help me escape?” Holding her right hand up Mari grinned at her, “On my honor.” Notes: Kylo is slime… What do you guys think? Any possibility of redemption? If I like your ideas they will almost definitely be put into the next couple of chapters. ;) Chapter 22 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “She left again. She always leaves…” “Love betrays…” “I will never love you… I can’t…” The world is burning around him, the cold, black stone archways crumbling around him. “I HATE YOU!” a voice---no he yells. As he lays on the ground, he wonders who he is screaming at. He hates a lot of people, and he hates a lot of things, but most of all? He hates himself. PART II: Six Months Later… “Alana.” She laid on her side with her back to the door, her legs pulled up to her chest, “Hmmm?” The bunk creaked as someone sat down behind her and a warm, roughly calloused hand ran over her arm. Slowly she turned over and stared up at him, “Poe?” Reaching up he ran his fingers through her hair and smiled at her sadly, “He’s awake.” ***************************************************************************** She glanced over her shoulder as the white doors slid closed between her and Poe. The room behind her went silent as she turned around. Leia stared at her from the head of the holo table, and Resistance officers and Intel specialists observe her with pure curiosity. Luke stood off to the side, his eyes covered in black cloth, and though she knew that he could not see her, it unnerved her the way his body tracked hers through the Force as she moved through the doors. Silently she walked up to the table and stood with her hands behind her back, “You asked to see me?” Leia nodded her head and waved everyone else out of the room. As soon as they were gone she and Luke walked around to the other end of the table, “Did Poe fill you in?” the older woman asked. Alana gave a stiff nod and glanced at Luke, “He said Ben’s awake.” “They’re running tests right now,” Luke murmured, “We---.” Leia cut her brother off impatiently, “It would help if you would just tell us what happened.” “I captured the First Order’s golden boy. Is that really not enough for you?” Alana hissed. Shaking her head she turned around, and moved towards the door, when Luke caught her by the arm lightly. “He asked to see you. You’re the first person he wanted to see.” Alana glared over her shoulder at him, “Liar.” “There are… issues with his memory, Alana. He doesn’t---,” Luke looked over at Leia and finished quietly, “He doesn’t remember.” With a hard jerk she shook Luke’s hand off of her and turned towards him, “He doesn’t remember what? Killing our friends? Massacring villages? Standing by as entire planets were destroyed?” She scoffed as Leia covered her face, “Well, that seems pretty damn well convenient.” Turning on her heel she stomped out of the room and marched down the hall. **************************************************************************** Her world was upside down as she hung over the side of the Seruna’s hull, tinkering and pulling the engines apart only to rebuild them again. “How many times are you going to do this?” Poe’s voice called up to her from below. Pulling off her goggles she sat up and looked down. He was standing beneath the scaffolding watching her as she slid down to the ground with a thud. “You’ve rebuilt this ship from top to bottom at least three times.” “It’s therapeutic,” she said as she tossed her bag of tools aside. He chuckled and followed her inside as she marched up the ramp. He came around the corner as she crouched down and pulled up the grate to the hydraulics system. Tying her hair back she jumped down into the hole and he crouched down watching her, “You’re not going to go see him, are you?” Bending down she stuck her arm inside reaching for the electrical mechanism and closed her eyes. “The last time I saw him, I was throwing his girlfriend out an airlock. So… No, I don’t think I will.” “But he doesn’t remember that----,” Poe stopped as her eyes flashed open and she stared up at him. With a sigh he held his hands up, “It’s going around the base. The med bay is closed off and someone hacked into the medi-droid server and got the files.” With a grunt, Alana pulled back her hand, wires and circuits resting in her palm. Shaking his head Poe held his hand out and she took it. With a sigh she leaned against him, once she was out of the maintenance shaft and shook her head, “I don’t want to see him.” Shaking his head, he leaned forward snaking his arms around her waist, “And I’m not telling you that you have to, but---.” Slowly she looked up at him, the corners of her eyes were wet, the edge of her mouth twitching as she stared at him sadly, “It won’t change anything.” “It might,” Poe whispered, “General Organa---,” he paused as she rolled her eyes, “She wants you to---.” “Placate him? Lie to him?” Alana said stepping back, “I know what she thinks of me, Poe. Four months here and she hasn’t spoken to me until today!” Ripping her hand from his she looked him up and down, “Instead she sends you to give me messages like we’re small children.” “She doesn’t think you’re a child, but when she looks at you---.” Alana looked down, “She sees the person who almost killed her son.” Turning around she moved the floor grate back into place, “I never should have stayed.” “Hey,” Poe murmured as he knelt in front of her. Reaching up he pushed her hair back and cupped her face with a soft smile. “You couldn’t leave. We both know you’d miss me too much.” She chuckled lightly as he leaned forward, and pressed his soft lips to hers sweetly as she closed her eyes. Reaching up she wound her fingers in his thick hair and he pulled her closer. Slowly they broke apart and she leaned against him, burying her face in his shoulder. “Talk to him,” Poe murmured, “Call it a favor to me?” Leaning back she studied his face, “Why do you care so much? You know what he did, Poe.” He shook his head and looked down at the floor with a sigh, “I know, I know, I just--- If you won’t do it for Leia, and you won’t do it for me, do it for yourself.” She scowled and he went on, “Alana you don’t go on missions with Rey and Luke. You can’t keep tearing down and rebuilding this ship.” Shaking her head she stood up, his eyes following her as she walked to the other side of the room, “You can be a pain sometimes you know that?” she asked as she walked around the corner. Poe smiled as her footsteps echoed down the ramp. “I love you too.” Notes: Sooooo... Time skip! Yay!!! Let me know if it's too confusing and I'll edit it. Try to be specific and keep in mind most of the stuff will be explained in the next chapter. Also about the whole Poe/Alana thingy: Chapter 23 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “I’m sorry ma’am. The med bay is closed off to civilian personnel, I can’t let you in.” Alana took in a deep breath and looked between the two guards. They both glanced at one another and swallowed waiting for her to lash out. With a relieved sigh, she turned around, “Alright I understa---.” “Oh no you don’t,” Luke said coming around the corner. Grabbing her by the elbow he turned her around and whispered in her ear, “Poe said you would try to run.” She frowned and looked up at him as they stopped in front of the guard station, “Can you blame me?” she muttered. Luke sighed, the bandages on his face wrinkling as he grimaced, “No, but that doesn’t mean I’m letting you get out of this that easily.” With a nod he motioned for the guard to come to the window, “She’s with me.” “Understood General.” Linking their arms, Luke walked her down the hall, “I’m curious, you’ve wanted nothing to do with Ben since we found you. Why agree to see him at all?” “I have my reasons and---,” Alana grit her teeth as they rounded a corner, “Poe wouldn’t stop talking about it.” “Ah…” Luke murmured nodding his head in understanding. “ Ah , what?” she spat. Luke pulled her to a stop before she walked into the door and she scowled, “I may be blind,” he said letting her go, “But I can see the effects he has on you. He’s a good man.” Alana crossed her arms and looked down as he sighed, “You two must be close if he’s so willing to persuade you to see Ben.” Her eyebrows crinkled, “What does that mean?” Shaking his head, Luke turned to the right and entered a white sterile room, “When Poe was captured, he and Ben… crossed paths. Poe probably isn’t his biggest fan.” Following after him, she stepped out of the way as medics separated them before running to catch up with him. “He never told me that,” she murmured and Luke shrugged as they came to a stop in front of a blackened window. “You had your own problems. We all know, Alana.” She flinched and stared at him as he turned towards the window, unaware of her gaze. After a few seconds of silence he turned towards her as the window began to lighten, making it easier to see within, “I don’t know what happened on Vijjun, but something did happen. The sooner you come to terms with that the better.” Alana swallowed and turned towards the window. On the other side of the glass was a pure white room. It was bare, with only a small bed at the far end. A thin figure, thinner than the last time she had seen him, stood and turned towards them. “Why isn’t he restrained?” she hissed. “He hasn’t hurt anyone yet, and he isn’t getting out of that room.” Alana tried to step back when she noticed Ben’s stare, but Luke caught her, “He can’t see us.” Ripping her hand back she moved to the side, Ben’s eyes seeming to track her as she moved, “Are you sure?” “The light to your left, is it red?” She glanced to the side, “No.” Luke flicked his wrist and forced a switch up across the room. The light turned red. “Alright, now he can’t see us.” Alana glanced back through the window, as Ben moved closer to the window. His face was pale, with dark circles beneath his eyes. Alana stepped forward as he pressed his fingers to the glass. Her chest tightened. I HATE YOU!!! Shaking her head she stepped away and turned back to Luke, “What does he remember? Luke shook his head, “We’re not sure.” She huffed and looked down, “So he could remember everything and just be… putting on a show?” she asked motioning over her shoulder. “We’ve been speaking to him through the intercom, but eventually he stopped talking back. Except to ask for two people. You and---,” Luke cut himself off and crossed his arms. “Who else did he ask for?” she pressed. Luke shook his head. “Han.” Alana’s jaw clenched and she turned back to the window. Ben had moved away from the window and was sitting with his back to the wall, staring at his hands. “He really doesn’t remember.” “As far as we can tell, his last memory is from before the First Order. That’s a long time before he killed Han.” “And you haven’t told him. Have you?” Luke pivoted to face her, “I---.” “I asked him not to.” Turning around Alana was greeted by Leia’s grim face, her eyes hard and morose at the same time. Alana spun back around and murmured to Luke, “You have to tell him.” “He doesn’t remember,” Leia said behind her, “How would you tell him.” The younger woman turned around, “I don’t know, but I’d sure as hell tell him before he remembers on his own. What do you think that will do to him?” “Now you care?” Leia said with a huff. “You’re his mother, I understand---.” Leia glared at her, “Don’t tell me you understand. You have no idea what this is like. This is our chance to have him back, but you’re going to take that from me.” Alana looked between Luke and his sister, and spread her hands in front of herself, “You said the last thing he remembers was from before everything went wrong. If that’s true then he’s… closer to being the Ben we know.” Slowly she turned to Leia, “But if you don’t tell him and he remembers on his own, then you’re going to have a serious problem on your hands.” Leia shook her head and looked to her brother, “Luke---.” “She’s right, Leia.” Alana looked at the old master in surprise, and stepped back as his sister began to yell. “No! He is my son. Not yours, you can’t---.” Steady despite his blindness, he reached out and stepped forward, placing his hands on her shoulders, “And if you want him back, you’ll let us help him.” Alana watched silently as the strongest woman she knew broke down. Sobbing Leia collapsed against her brother. Holding her tightly he turned to Alana and nodded his head. “You’re the one he wants to see. He’ll probably take it better from you.” She shook her head and began to argue when Luke murmured, “Please.” With a weary sigh she turned around and stared through the window, “I make it way too easy sometimes.” ***************************************************************************** She watched him as she entered the room. Still propped up against the wall, Ben stared at his hands, not giving her a single glance. “It must have been bad,” he murmured. Standing across from him, she leaned against the wall, watching him warily. “What must have been bad?” Brown eyes snapped up and stared at her and a chill ran down her back, “The accident. You’re the first person they’ve let in to see me.” He glanced at the window, “Though last I knew, physical injuries weren’t contagious.” Alana tilted her head to the side, her face tense, her body ready to spring into action. Ben watched her for a moment, “You look… different.” “Ten years will do that to you.” He chuckled and rested his head against the wall, “That long huh?” She didn’t react and he looked around the room, “Where are we? No one would tell me anything.” She sighed, “Forest moon. It’s one of the old Rebel bases from before the Empire fell. Leia took it over when the last base was destroyed.” Ben’s brow furrowed in confusion, “Who destroyed the last one?” She clapped her mouth shut, Maura did, she thought, remembering the woman who had threatened to have her killed when they rescued Leia. The old bat should have known she was in trouble when the First Order pushed the Resistance back to the Inner Rim. Slowly Alana slid against the wall until she was sitting against the floor, and ignored his question, “What’s the last thing you remember?” “Broken collarbone from sparring.” She tried to ignore his gaze as she tried to remember back, “You were how old? Sixteen? “Fifteen,” he corrected her. Alana closed her mouth and he sighed, “Are you going to tell me what I’ve missed now, or am I just going to have to wait in here until I remember?” Clasping her hands in front of her she glanced at the window, “A year after that, I passed my exit exam.” “You’re a knight,” he said nodding his head, and giving a shrug, “What does this have to do with my memory?” She inclined her head and continued, “For my first mission, they had me investigate disappearances, Force adepts that were being abducted across the colonies.” Ben crossed his arms impatiently, but she ignored him, “I figured out what was happening--- I thought it was some kind of cult--- and Luke ordered me to infiltrate and send data back to the Academy.” She looked down, “It wasn’t a cult though. It was remnants of the Empire.” Pushing herself up on her hand she unfurled her legs letting them slide across the floor in front of her, “They called themselves the First Order, and after I found my way inside they figured out who I was.” Ben sighed impatiently, “Ali---.” She flinched at the name and all but growled at him, “Just shut up and let me talk, will you?” He frowned, “Fine.” With a sigh she relaxed, “They were training the adepts in combat, for this thing called the Knights of Ren and when they found out who I was they tried to make me turn.” Ben frowned and she stood up slowly, gripping the hem of her blue tunic, “You know I was always stubborn,” she mumbled as she turned around, and pulled up the back of her shirt. She heard him take in a sudden breath and grimaced in self-consciousness as she let her shirt fall back into place. Turning around she glanced at him and crossed her arms. “You---.” “I didn’t turn,” she answered for him, “I was betting that once I stopped transmitting data to the Academy, someone would eventually come looking for me.” She glared at the window briefly, before sitting back on the floor, “But they never came.” Ben stared at her sadly, “Ali, this is--- I’m sorry, but what does this have to do with me?” She chuffed and stared up at the ceiling, “I thought it would be best to start from the beginning.” She looked down, “Luke didn’t come, the other Jedi didn’t come, and I… I hated them for it. I could feel it,” she said, “The dark. It was like a shadow creeping over my skin, but then… you showed up.” Ben sat up and she shook her head, “Apparently you stole the Falcon from your dad. Took it to the colonies and jumped to a cargo vessel.” She chuckled, “He---,” she looked down and wiped her nose before whispering, “I…” she swallowed and looked back up at him, “They caught you before we could even get out of the cell, and they started to train us.” Ben looked down and she cleared her throat, “We were the jackpot. Two trained Jedi, young enough to mold, naïve enough to manipulate. You and I were their best candidates.” “For what?” he asked without looking at her. “An apprenticeship,” she answered. “I started to give in,” she admitted, avoiding his gaze when his head snapped up to stare at her. His voice was panicked, “Did I----?” “No,” she whispered, “You fought back when I didn’t. I was the weak one.” She closed her eyes, “But you couldn’t hold out forever. That’s when Luke showed up.” Crossing her arms she began to dryly tell him the events of the battle, “…We were pinned. I was shot in the leg, you were exhausted,” she shook her head, “We shouldn’t have made it out of there.” Ben set his jaw, “But we did, didn’t we? We made it out?” She shook her head, “ We didn’t.” *** They have her propped up against the wall behind them covering their backs with a small blaster. She lets out a groan as pain shoots through her leg and somehow she let off a shot shooting a trooper in the head. He flies back, and his squad mates run back around the corner to avoid being shot at. She turns and looks at Luke and Ben. They’re arguing, but she can’t hear them over the sound of blaster fire. Luke tries to cross over to Ben’s side of the corridor, but jumps back as the troopers shook at him. Ben glances down at her and yells something. She still can’t hear him, but she catches the end of his sentence, as his lips form the words, “Get her out.” Then he runs towards the troopers, leaving them behind. **** Alana bit the inside of her cheek, “You stayed. Notes: Soooooooo I don’t normally make mistakes like this, but you guys remember when Luke, Ren, and Alana fought on Malachor??? I kind of forgot that Luke was blinded in that fight and forgot to incorporate that in the last chapter. There are several Jedi masters (if you’ve read any of the books, or played the games) that have been blinded but were still able to “see” through the Force. --- it’s edited now, but so you don’t have to reread it I’ve pasted the passage (When Alana meets with Luke and Leia to discuss Ben) that talks about it below: She glanced over her shoulder as the white doors slid closed between her and Poe. The room behind her went silent as she turned around. Leia stared at her from the head of the holo table, and Resistance officers and Intel specialists observe her with pure curiosity. Luke stood off to the side, his eyes covered in black cloth, and though she knew that he could not see her, it unnerved her the way his body tracked hers through the Force as she moved through the doors. Silently she walked up to the table and stood with her hands behind her back, “You asked to see me?” Chapter 24 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) White walls surround her, with a white cot in the corner of the room, with stark white sheets pulled tightly at the corners. The floor is bare and cold, and she picks her feet up wrapping her arms around her knees as she sits in an uncomfortable chair, staring out the window at the frozen white landscape. A pulsing pain shoot through her leg, and every time she closes her eyes she can feel the blaster bolt burning through her muscles and skin again. She has no idea where she is, and she does not care. Her nimble fingers pluck at the rough material of the bleached uniform the medics forced her in to despite her violent protestations. The door behind her hisses as it opens and soft footsteps come in to the room. A familiar voice echoes softly behind her. “Alana, you have a visitor.” She doesn’t move. The room is silent as her visitors wait for her reply, and a short, awkward cough fills the air. “She hasn’t said a word for weeks. Not even to me,” Luke’s voice whispers. Unintelligible whispers answer back and she cocks her head, watching as snowflakes flutter past her window. She focuses on one flake of snow, stopping it in midair with her power, pressing it to the glass in front of her face. Quickly it melts away. The voices behind her argue amongst themselves. “She’s dangerous,” a woman’s voice hisses, “You heard what the guards said. She tried to kill them---.” “She’s a girl,” a man answers back, “And she’s our best chance at finding Ben.” The group falls silent. After a few seconds the woman ceases to whisper and her voice is loud, “Ben wouldn’t be missing if it wasn’t for her.” Stiff silence followed her statement. Luke’s voice shattered the silence, “If there’s anyone to blame for this it’s me, Leia. I sent Alana on that mission--- I’m the reason Ben---.” “I do blame you.” Leia’s voice is hard and hoarse when she cuts her brother off, as though she is holding back from screaming at all of them. Hurried footsteps scurry and the door hisses as someone flees from the room. The man from before calls after her. “Leia! Blast it.” Alana continues to stare out the window as the man sighs, still listening, but refusing to speak or move. Luke’s sigh joins the still nameless man’s and he lowers his voice, “Han, I swear I’m doing everything I can to find him.” Han is silent for a moment, until he finally answers, “I know you are. We’re just…” He trails off with another exhausted sigh. “If he’s still alive…” “He is. You and Leia would have felt it if he wasn’t.” The two men fall silent behind her for a few moments and she can feel their eyes studying her. “You think she can help us?” Han asks. She can feel a pulse of pain coming from Luke. “I don’t know,” he says, “The damage to her body… She’s lucky to be alive, and her mind? We have no idea what they did to her.” Footsteps clack behind her and a figure appears beside her with silver hair and brown familiar eyes. Alana turns her head and stares up at him dully in utter silence. “Alana?” ************************************************************************************* “Alana?” Ben’s voice echoed through the room, pulling her from her thoughts, and memories. The cold stone floor beneath her chilled her hands as she stared at the wall across from her, remembering her return to the academy after her imprisonment. Ben called her again in a low concerned voice. “Alana?” Shaking her head she looked across the room, as Ben sat up with worry plain his face as he studied her. She stared at him as he slowly rose to his feet, and made his way across the room, his eyes staring into hers as he crouched down before her. “What’s wrong?” Alana shook her head and tried to move away but he caught her by the hand. She flinched at the feel of his skin on hers and also at the feeling of uneasiness sparking out in the Force from behind the observation window. She held her breath as she glanced at the reflective mirror. They had an audience. Poe. A warm hand cupped her cheek and she turned back to face Ben. His warm brown eyes stared into hers, so trusting, so gentle. So different… Ben turned his head slightly and gave a small smile, “What aren’t you telling me, Ali?” Everything. “I…” Alana looked back at the window and pushed his hand away from her, forcing him to move back. Quickly she stood up, and moved away from him, going to stand in front of the mirror, staring at her reflection. Tell him. “Ali.” Her eyes glanced up, spotting his reflection in the mirror. Slowly she closed her eyes and sighed. “Han.” Ben froze and she turned around, shooting a look through the window. Ben crossed his arms and she took a deep breath, “He’s gone Ben.” His arms fell and his face turned white, “What are you saying?” he asked hoarsely. Raising her chin, Alana stared him in the eye. “He’s dead.” Pain blinded her in the Force as Ben lost control of his emotions, and she stepped back as he stumbled forward. “You’re wrong,” he whispered, as he settled on the floor, on his hands and knees. “You’re wrong!” Alana’s voice was barely a whisper, “I wish I was.” She stared at him as he choked, and gagged. Sobbing, he sat back on his knees and stared up at the ceiling, his long hair flowing back over his shoulders, tears slipping down his cheeks. The room was filled with the sound of his mourning. Alana stared at him impassively, unwilling to console him, to hold him, to whisper kind words that everything was alright. Nothing was alright. He needed to know the truth. Raising his arm Ben wiped his face, and raked his fingers through his hair. “How?” His voice was choked. Alana swallowed. “He was murdered.” Notes: Next chapter will have more about what happened. I'm trying to figure out if I want Ben to know he killed Han now, or if I want to wait and have Alana lie to him. What do ya'll think? Oh and hi! It's nice to be back! :) Chapter 25 Hey, guys! I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I'm not going to update here anymore. I'm making the transition to wattpad, simply because it's easier, I can message people, I can add media easier, it's easier to upload there. A new chapter will be coming out there soon, so here's the link! It's also has a new title=== Star Wars: Repayment and I'm reworking the storyline. I hope to see you there! Notes: Kudos and comments are always welcome!
