The first time Poe sees Millicent staring at him from behind the coffee table, all puffed up orange fur and the slightest hint of a growl rumbling in her throat because who is this interloper in her house , his face lights up. Lights up like the goddamn sun , and Kylo’s stomach flips over because, holy shit, he’s cute as well as being really unfairly attractive? (maybe also a little because he wants Poe to look at him like that, except not that at all because Kylo Ren is not jealous of his asshole roommate’s asshole cat) After a good two minutes of Poe trying to encourage Millicent to let him pet her, followed by Kylo having to dig out a band-aid for him after she takes a swipe at his hand, Poe finally turns his attention back to Kylo. (he is not jealous of Hux’s cat) “Didn’t think you were supposed to have pets in student accommodation,” he says, an eyebrow raised and that grin on his face that Kylo’s pretty sure makes his cheeks go pink every time. He just shrugs, though, turning away to glance at where Millicent is still hunched and glaring. “She’s not mine. My roommate brought her from home, said his dad probably wouldn’t bother to feed her otherwise.” He goes quiet for a moment, looks back at Poe. “He’s about as friendly as her, by the way. You’ll know him if you see him, because his hair matches her fur. And he’d probably swipe you like her given half a chance.” That makes Poe laugh and run his hands through his hair, grinning at Kylo as he settles himself down on the couch in a lazy sprawl, and, well. If Kylo’s pretty sure he’d do anything to keep Poe Dameron looking at him like that, well fuck, who wouldn’t ? (goddamn, he’s in too deep) Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 2 of the PKH College AU series
