"So, how's it going with tall, dark and handsome?" Hux snorted into his glass of brandy and lowered it just enough for Phasma to hear him answer clearly. "Oh please, it's more accurate to call him tall, dork and handsy; he is quite possibly the most awkward and infuriating person I have ever-" "Slept with?" "-met," Hux finished, glaring daggers at Phasma's nonchalant interruption. "Although yes, that as well." A loud shout echoed from the other side of the room where, by the sound of it, Ren just sunk his fist into some poor sap's face and Hux cut himself off with a sigh and a well-deserved swig from his drink. He'd seen Ren start enough fights in bars to know exactly when to step in to stop them from getting kicked out when possible, but right now the noises of scuffle told him that there was absolutely no way this one was going to end without serious consequences. Kriff, and he had really liked this place. "Still-" Hux downed the rest of his drink and got to his feet, eyes finally sweeping the room to see Ren slam yet another one of his opponents into (and through) a table, a sense of both annoyance and protectiveness washing over him as he watched more guys storm at him. "The sex is amazing, so I suppose I might have to do something to ensure it continues in the future. If you would be kind enough to order me another glass of brandy by the time I get back, that would be appreciated." Phasma grinned and instead quietly swiped the entire bottle from under the counter as she watched Hux stalk off to deck some unfortunate bastard currently aiming a chair at Kylo's head. She had a feeling Hux would appreciate it more than just a glass. Notes: idk time-to-change-away on tumblr
