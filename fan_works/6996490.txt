General Hux was a man of order. He always did things by the book and forced himself to remain calm in any situation. It was annoying, really, how much he liked things to be absolutely perfect. Today at a meeting , however, Kylo Ren noticed something unusual about him. Something... Different. He was fidgeting a lot in his seat. Like, a LOT. It was unusual. Well, unusual for him. He usually stayed as straight as an iron broomstick. *if such a thing even existed*, Kylo thought. Seeing him so different was actually distracting. And Kylo couldn't really care less for order. Force, what could make Hux so fidgety? Ren looked at Phasma, who was next to him. "Psst. Phas." She turned her head around. "What?" she whispered. "I think Hux is acting strange... Have you noticed anything different about him?" She looked at him for a moment. "Well he does look irritated. More irritated than usual, I mean. Heh." "I wonder why." "Can't you read his mind or something?" "Tried. He's embarrassed about something but whenever i try to go further, He'll give me a death glare and won't let me. I think he was trained to resist Force users... It feels like it was all just to annoy me" Ren stared at the polished floor. "Oh." What neither of them knew at the moment, was that General Hux had a very urgent need to piss. He was trying to end the meeting early, and, eventually, it finally did. He was surprisingly the last one to get up from their chairs. Kylo walked up to him. "Hux. Are you okay?" Ren couldn't believe he was asking but whatever. "You seem different..." Hux lowered his head and walked faster. Ren positioned himself at the door so Hux couldn't leave. The general couldn't even read his expression. Stupid mask. "Are you avoiding me? Why are you avoiding me?" Hux grumbled. "Let me go, Ren." "Why won't you tell me what's wrong?" "I said. Let. Me. GO." "Not until you answer me." "Excuse me? No." "Excuse ME? Yes." Kylo slid off his helmet. Hux stared for a while then looked away. "Why are you acting strange? Why won't you answer? ANSWER!" "You have no right to do this." "Sorry. Didn't hear you." Kylo rolled his eyes. "Answer or stay here." "Why should i listen to a petulant man child like you?" "Do you really want me to Force it out of your head?" "I dare you to try." the ginger spat back. "If you say so..." "Wait-! I didn't actually mean-! Ah!" Ren held out a hand and deeply concentrated. "W- Ugh! Wait! S-Stop!" Hux tried to fight back the intrusion of his mind. Kylo violently pulled away. "Well?" He crossed his arms. Hux slowly moved his eyes to look at Ren. His irises went small and his heart raced. Kylo swore he saw a little blush. (And it was definitely *NOT* cute) "I... Umm... Uh... I have... somewhere very... important... To go. Excuse me..." Kylo raised a doubtful eyebrow. Hux frowned. "It's... Really urgent?..." he almost said in a whimper and started moving his right leg anxiously. Kylo rolled his eyes. "You forget, I can sense when you're lying." ".......... Shit..." "So... What's the truth?" "... I... Really... Umm... have to....." Kylo looked expectantly. "I can't do this..." Hux whispered. "I'll tell you later just, please, let me go!" He sounded desperate yet Ren didn't even make an attempt at moving. "Dammit... Fine... I... Have to...... Promise you wont say anything... But... You see... I..." Hux took a big inhale and shut his eyes closed, like if he were making a deadly confession. "I've really had to piss for the past few hours and I would very much appreciate it if you'd go away and PLEASE let me get out of here..." Hux looked away embarrassed and immediately held himself with his right hand. Kylo's eyes widened. Oh. OH. So THAT was why the General was so fidgety. *He probably drinks a lot of water... and has to piss a lot... That actually sounds really hot... What?! No it doesn't* either way, Ren looked too long. Hux was uncomfortable. He bit back a moan. "R-Ren? Will you... Ah... l-let me g-go? K-Kylo?" his breathing quickened. "W-What? Oh. Sorry, Umm. Uhh..." Kylo bit his lip and stared at Hux for a few minutes... "REN! LET ME OUT! NOW!" Kylo for some reason pinned him to the wall using the force. "AH! Ah! W-what are y-you doing?!? I told you to let me go! I... Mm! Can't hold it! Ah!" a few tears streamed down his face and he held himself with his other hand. Damn sensitive gingers. "Good. I'd love to watch the composed little General Hux embarrass himself by losing control- In front of me~" Ren said as his face got really close to Hux's. "WHAT?!? RELEASE ME THIS INSTANT! DON'T YOU DARE!" Hux yelled so loud that his voice cracked. He blushed furiously. "Come on, general. I know you love the feeling of being so full for so many long, torturous hours... Almost on the verge of relief... So pleasurable... It arouses you like nothing else can... How dirty..." Hux moaned. Sexy. Kylo violently ripped Hux's arms away from his crotch. He held him on the air against the wall, using the force. Hux slowly started to loose control. A few drops trickled down his legs. "N-no... No..." Hux let out a cry of pain and pleasure. Kylo positioned himself between Hux's legs and drank his piss. He used the force to press down on Hux's bladder so his piss would come out faster. Hux repeatedly moaned really loudly and his eyes rolled to the back of his head. He was soaking his uniform and Kylo Ren's face with his piss inside a conference room and he was super embarrassed about it but the relief just felt so amazing... He actually came in his pants without even being touched... And his piss was still flowing for another minute. Hux was mortified and it clearly showed. Ren licked his lips "Don't be so embarassed about it, it's happened to me before... unfortunately for you, you've never seen... What a shame..." Hux couldn't help but blush even harder at the idea of Kylo Ren actually pissing himself... How damn hot would it be to see him holding it until he couldn't anymore... Moans coming from that deep and sexy smooth voice... Piss flowing violently out of him, and down his legs... To the floor... And being able to taste it all... "Wow, General. I didn't know you could be such a slut." Kylo said, smiling and biting his lip while laying proudly in a puddle of crystal clear piss. Hux looked away. He swallowed his pride and made an attempt at being intimidating. "Ughh... Says the idiot who drank almost all my urine" He failed. His voice was shaky. "Pfft... Says the idiot who orgasmed because pissing himself on someone else after holding it for hours was just *that* arousing." Kylo sat up and placed his left hand on his left knee. Hux's eyes widened. "W-wait... You- noticed?" "Of course I did. Your piss was a bit white-ish and tasted better with your cum mixed in it..." He looked up at Hux. "...You look prettier like this... All embarassed and cute... I could kiss your beautifu-" They were both suddenly startled by the room's door opening. Phasma burst in. Hux's heart raced like a falcon. "Is everything okay in he-!" she looked to the corner Hux and Kylo were soaked in. Hux blushed harder. "... WHAT?... Why are you guys... wet? And... Why in the galaxy are you in that... weird position? Hux, were you crying?!?!?" Hux gulped and licked away a dry tear. "We... can explain...?" "Oh force, do explain..." "Well you see, after the meeting, Hux... Well... Umm... There's really no other way of putting this, so..." Kylo rubbed his damp hair. He took a big inhale. "Hux had to pee really badly and he was ignoring me so I didn't let him leave because he wouldn't tell me what was wrong with him then i bothered him about it and he told me how bad he had to piss and I kind of pinned him here and kind of, sort of, maybe... made him piss himself all over me..." "...That's..." Phasma stood there dumbfounded. "...Hot..." Notes: Thank you for reading! I love you all! I'm sorry for the cliffhanger-ishy ending. I may or may not be working on a sequel, so there's that. Kind of, sort of, maybe will include our fav angst trash (Kylo <3) omorashi~. Tumblr: http://kylux-fangirl.tumblr.com
