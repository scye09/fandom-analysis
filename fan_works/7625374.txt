Are there people out there in fandom who are like, "Hmm, what is this Star Wars thing then, should I watch it? Convince me!" Ihni. If there are, this might be that thing, but I've been calling this my "Star Wars id-vid". It's the parts of Star Wars that I love best, set to a dance song that is one of my faves—my love letter to the Star Wars universe, if you will. There's a lot of prequel clips, a shitload of OT3 feels (x3), and not a single frame of Hux, because this is MY Star Wars happy place, and I apologize for nothing. Thanks to moonling, the Luke to my Han and my alpha watcher always, who put up with chunks of this song being played on loop in our apartment A LOT—the Skywalker robohands mini-section is for her; queelez, for being Prequels Trash with me and keeping me company while I vidded; anoel, platinumvampyr, war_kitten, and laura47 for their absolutely invaluable beta help; and a TON of other amazing people for cheerleading and encouraging me. (Also, hi guys, this is the first vid I've finished in a decade. BEEN A WHILE. Turns out it's like riding a bike. "Chewie, we're home," indeed.)
