Hux sighed when he heard the sound of retching continue in his bathroom. Wordlessly he shrugged out of his coat and uniform shirt, stripping down to a grey tank top and his boxers. When this was finished he stepped into the bathroom and approached the kneeling man emptying his stomach contents into the toilet. "Ren..." "Sorry..." Kylo mumbled. He sighed as Hux ran his fingers through his hair, pulling it back and off of his neck. "Thank you," he mumbled. He paled and lurched forward as he felt another wave wash over him. "You'll be okay," Hux assured him. He used a free hand to rub his back with the palm. "Easy..." "I hate this..." "I know." "Damned sickness..." "Don't talk. Focus on breathing." He nodded his head when Kylo started to obey, smiling as he kissed his forehead. "There we go."
