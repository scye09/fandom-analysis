"Leia... there's a new person in your life... you can't just shut her out because you got confused. It's not fair on the child..." Keylani's voice is soft even as she moves to follow Leia into a more secluded area of the tent, her voice as soft and rich as ever, toned with kindness but the same toughness that she had always displayed.

She wants to help you. To be with you." "I know... I can sense it I just..." Leia sighs then shrugs. "I'm afraid..." "Then tell her..."
