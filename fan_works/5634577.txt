It was in that instance, that one moment that she didn't care. Her memories and survival instincts from when she lived in Jakku vanished. Her walls crumbled, and for the first time, she didn't feel the need to be defensive. It was in that instance, that one moment, that the background chatter faded into obscurity. The people that are around, ceased to be. Her surrounding portrayed a water painting. Muffled and unclear except for the foreground. For the foreground was where her focus lies, the brown, the black, the white and other splashes of colour working in unity, creating this image. It was in that instance, that one moment, where she felt like she belonged. Like a seasoned dancer, reminiscent of a dance routine long since expired. She let her body lead her, all of it as if muscle memory from a distant thought, lost in the echoes of the world she recently discovered. It was in that instance, that one moment, where she finally laid eyes on her dance partner. An old friend, under a new name, a new face. But still the same dance moves, and still the same man. It was in that instance, that one moment, where Poe Dameron caught her before she fell. It was in that instance, that one moment, where she met Poe Dameron, and fell for him.
