The bell rang and your ‘friends’ surrounded you talking your ear off, but you were uninterested. You made your way towards Louis “Hey dork, long night last night?” you joked with him. He smiled back “You could say that” he replied. You knew Louis always liked you, it was no secret, but you could never date him, your friends approve. He seemed so distant lately though, and that was one person’s attention you actually missed. The two of you walked home together. Well, more he walked and you followed him. Suddenly he stopped, dead in his tracks he just stopped. You watched as he slowly turned his head and stared at the news stand. You read the headline aloud “Spider man, city enemy” “Do you believe that stuff?” you said turning to him. He remained quiet, and still stared. “I have to go” he said bluntly and started rushing away. That night you hear a knock on your window. You open your window surprised to find Louis; you smile. He climbs his way into room. “Uhh sorry I’ve been acting weird lately” he says shyly. “What’s been up with you lately?” you reply. He navigates your question “I can’t say long,” he says completely off topic. You watch him as he goes and sits on your bed; he looks so distracted. You sit next to him on the bed, placing your hand over his trying to comfort him. You stared forward; you could feel his stare had drifted to you, but you were afraid to look back at him. Eventually you give in and look back at him. The two of you hold a stare for a while until the two of your faces meet. Next thing you know you find the two of you snogging. Louis pulls away abruptly, he curls his lips and you just stare at him. “I-I have to go…” he said letting the word ‘go’ linger a little longer. You watched him as his stare lingered a little longer, and he exited your window. The next day you didn’t see Louis at school. This saddened you, but you went on as if it was a normal day; no one could know you cared. You walked home alone, which ended up being a bad idea. A tall man walks up to you with a gun. He covered your mouth and said “Do what I say, okay beautiful?” his breath stunk and you squirmed as he dragged you into an alley. While walking backwards you feel the criminal run into someone in the alley. “You know why don’t you pick on someone your own size.” You hear a voice say. The criminal turns and points the gun where the voice is coming from. It was Spider Man. Spider Man was able to knock the gun out of the guys hand; catch it, and point it at the criminal. “Now just let the girl go and get lost” Spider Man said. The criminal did just that. Spider Man grabs you and using web swings you across the city and all the way to your apartment window. Baffled that he knew where you lived without you saying a word you slowly reached your hands towards his mask. You put a grasp on the top and held it for a moment to see his reaction. He does nothing, so you pull it off. “Louis!” you said in a gasp. He looked hurt as he hung his sweaty now mask lessface. You pulled him in the window and sat next to him stroking his face. “You never told me. But how- why- Louis-“ you say grabbing his hand. He limply pulls his hand away. “(Y/N) we can’t- we can’t be together.” He said limply. It broke your heart to hear, but at the same time you could tell it broke his heart to say it. ”I just wouldn’t be able to stand to see you get hurt, I love you (Y/N), I always have but we can be..” he added. You quickly react and kiss his lips; he gives into the kiss. “I love you too,” you whisper as you pull away. He kisses your forehead and begins to walk away. “I will wait for you.” You say quickly. He turns around, “I know,” he said with a smile and a wink, then he was gone for the night.

He was a god of thunder, but when trouble struck Earth he came down to fulfill his duty as a peace keeper to Earth. The only problem was he destroyed the place he normally stays in Earth last time he was down there, and now he had nowhere to go. ‘Knock, knock, knock,’ the sound rang through your house. “Ugh coming” you said as you stumbled out of your bed grabbing your head. You couldn’t believe it, who on Earth would come knocking on your door, it was 5 in the morning couldn’t it wait. You opened your door and there is one hunk of a man standing there. Everything about him was out of this world; his bright godly blue eyes, his shining perfect blond hair, even his body was flawless and muscular. “Greetings” He said in a merry tone. Gosh he even had a perfect accent. As you stood speechless at the doorstep, he made his way on “May I use this as a residence,” he said. Now you were officially confused “Huh?” you manage to squeak out. He stands up on your sofa and puts his hands on his hips. “I am Thoran, thunder god, and peace keeper of Earth. Earth is in a time of need and I dove thee as a trust worthy inn mate.” He said nobly. You literally laughed out loud. You walked away to grab something, and when you came back you totally planned on kicking him out. But to your surprise when you came back he was asleep on the sofa, so he stayed. The next morning you woke up to a bang, startled you ran to the living room to find Thoran next to a smashed tv. “Uhh, I lost grip of my hammer there..” he said guiltily. You couldn’t help but feel sorry for him, so you took him out for lunch. “My mortal form has grown weak I need substance!” he joked; or at least it seemed like a joke to you You have defiantly come to the conclusion that this hunk was completely mental. As walking home thinking this suddenly you hear screams. You look up and witness what looks like an alien force attacking the town. Suddenly Thoran jumped into action, throwing his hammer knocking quite a few out at once. You ran and quickly hid under, old man Jenkin’s porch. You could still see the fighting and Thoran was incredible! He knocked them out , and that hammer thing was amazing! Only he could pick it up it was so heavy, plus it summoned thunder. You were starting to believe Thoran was a god. The other thing that amazed you about his fighting style was as he fought he shouted inspirational quotes to the enemies; quotes about love, peace, and responsibilities. Gosh hot and sensible! After the fighting is over you crawl out from under the porch and approach him. “Human! You’re okay, I’m so glad!” he said running up to you and picking you up giving you a hug. You were smushed and in slight pain but really didn’t care. He stopped and addressed you by your name “Angie I came here yes, because I am Earth’s protector but my brother was after you cause’ he knew I loved you. We met in another life, you don’t remember, humans never do, but I do and we were in love. My brother was angry so came to attack you, I have to go back, I am king of my world and I must not let them down. I will always love you and be there watching over you” he says very straight forward, then plants a kiss on you (cue sparks fly). Before you knew it he was gone and a single tear rolled down your cheek. But every night before you would go to bed, you stared into the starry night sky; and every night you do the stars seem to wink at you feel a comforting warmth on you.

I looked over at Harry and sighed when I saw the cut and bruise on his jaw. Thoughts of last night started filling my mind and I groaned as my head fell back on the pillow. The club, the drinking, the fight, everything. ~Flashback~ “mmm…lookin’ good baby.” A stranger came up behind me at the bar and started whispering in my ear, obviously drunk. Harry was using the restroom and I was taking my 3rd shot waiting for him. “Excuse me?” I swallowed the last bit and turned around to face the pig behind me. “What I mean is you have a pretty amazing sexy body.” He winked and brought his hand up to my waist. Naturally I pushed his hand away, but he was a lot stronger than me. “Look, I have a boyfriend and I’m nowhere near being interested so leave me alone would you?” I sounded a lot more confident than I felt. “Feisty, huh?” he winked again and this time put both hands on my waist, trailing them down to my ass. I gasped and started to push him away when I saw a not so somber Harry stumbled up and behind the jerk and pull him away from me. “What the hell do you think you’re doing touching my girl?” Harry yells and shoves the guy in the chest “Oh I’m sorry this is your slut?” the guy pointed to me and smirked “What’d you just call her?” Harry grabbed him by his collar and got in his face. I was personally too shocked to even do anything.. I’d never seen Harry like this before. “I said….slut?” the stranger fired back and punched Harry in the gut. “Harry!” I yelled and ran over to him, tears welling up in my eyes at the sight of my boyfriend huddled over gasping for air. “Get outta the way!” the other guy shoved me out of the way and I fell against my barstool, watching him pick Harry back up and punch him in the jaw. Harry fought to stand back up and held onto his jaw, for a minute, then pulled away and looked at the blood on his hand. “I don’t know who the hell you think you are. But don’t you ever call her a slut, ever again.” Harry clenched his fist and swung at the guy’s face, completely knocking the wind out of him. Tears streaming down my face, I grabbed onto Harry’s arm and pulled him away. “No I’m not done with this ass.” Harry mumbled “Harry, no, please.” I pleaded “Let’s go home.” I pulled him closer to me and dragged him outside into the dark night. ~End of Flashback~ I pushed aside the thoughts of last night and got out of bed. I stretched then walked downstairs to go a fix a cup of coffee. After my cup started brewing, I began looking through the cabinets for the first aid kit we kept in the house. Being that Harry was so drunk and tired last night, I didn’t get a chance to fix him up. I finally found it and pulled it out when I felt someone’s presence behind me. I turned around to see Harry standing there, his hands deep in the pockets of his sweatpants and by the look on his face I knew he was in pain. “Hazza? You okay?” I asked concernedly. His eyeswere almost glazed over, he wouldn’t look right at me. “I’m sorry.” He whispered dejectedly “For what?” I asked and walked over to him, cupping his face in my hands and being careful not to put too much pressure on his jaw. “I was so stupid and careless last night.” He puts his arms around my waist and pulled my body closer to him. “Hazz, you were drunk.” I whispered “Exactly. That was careless.” He replied “Hey..stop.” I looked into his eyes and pulled his face close. “You didn’t do anything wrong .you were defending me. Although this won’t exactly be one of my favorite memories of you defending me, you were defending me none the less. And I love you for that.” I smiled lightly and kissed his lips tenderly “And I have to say. It was pretty badass when you knocked him out before we left.” I giggled Harry smiled a little and pushed his forehead against mine. “Now, would you let me fix this?” I asked indicating the wound on his jaw. He nodded slowly and placed his lips to my cheek softly. “..I was pretty badass wasn’t I.” he grinned and I pushed him away lightly, laughing at how he was making light of the situation. “I love you, Styles.” I chuckled Chapter 12 : 100 Ways to say I Love You Summary: Key: (Y/F/N) or (Y/N)- Your First Name or Your Name (Y/L/N)- Your Last Name (H/C)- Hair Color (H/L)- Hair Length (E/C)- Eye Color (F/C)- Favorite Color (F/D)- Favorite Drink (F/F)- Favorite Flower (F/P)- Favorite Place (H/L)- Hair Length (F/B)- Favorite Breakfast (F/L)- Favorite Lunch (F/D)- Favorite Dinner (F/O)- Favorite Outfit (Y/A)- Your Age One Hundred Ways to Say ‘I Love You’ 1. “Pull over.

He was the newest thing, girls liked him cause’ he was one hunk of a man, guys liked him cause’ he kicked butt, and all in all he was just out of this world. It started slow, you were in the wrong place at the wrong time (or was it the right place at the right time). You stopped by your office building to grab a few papers. You didn’t work that weekend, but you wanted to get a head start. Hardly anyone was in the building. As you got in the elevator to go up to your office, when it stopped and the lights went out. You heard the fire alarm in the distance and suddenly you began to panic. You felt the heat on the elevator floor “I’m doomed” you thought. The elevator began to jerk and shake as its chords snapped from the heat. Suddenly the elevator doors are forced open. A handsome man with curly brown hair slicked and gorgeous eyes reaches his hand out. It was Superman. He grabs you and flies you out of the building. In his arms you soar through across the city. He sets you down somewhere in central park, smiles and winks, and then with a few ruffled leaves, he disappeared into the sky. You dreamed of him for days and nights after the incident, you knew it was crazy but you swore you fell in love with him that day. One day you became desperate to find Superman, and went looking for trouble. You went to the worst part of town and began walking around; it scared you but “it’d be worth it” you thought you find yourself being pushed around by some drunk men. You closed your eyes tight and imagined Superman sweeping in and saving you but at the moment he was now where to be found. The floor rattled and you opened your eyes. It was Superman who just landed in front of you and the men. The men were scared and with their shaking hands held up guns. One shot at him but he caught the bullet and crushed it. The men were officially freaked out and dropped their guns. Superman took a swing and knocked a few out. He took you and once again he flew across the city. This time when he’s flying he asks you where you want him to drop you off. You direct him to you apartment rooftop. He places you down ”You just have an act for getting into trouble don’t you?” he asks. You blush a bit. ”What’s your name lovely?” he asks “(Y/N)”you reply. He shakes your hand smiling. “Stay out of trouble this time.” He says chuckling as he takes off to the sky leaving you once again. Every night, you would take a mug of warm tea to the rooftop and sit. You would sit and wait for him, stare at the stars and just wait. The second night he landed on the rooftop. “So what are you waiting for?” he asked as he approached you. You cleared your throat, ”You.” You said shyly. He smiled “Wanna see something?” he asked looking at you. You nodded. He picked you up holding you tight against his chest and started flying. As the two of you flew you felt on top of the world. He stopped and stood you on a mountain. “Why’d we stop here?” you asked. He smiles and responds “Cause’ this is my favorite view on all of the Earth and ..” then he plants one on you. A kiss; sweetly, tender, and flawless. He flies you back to the rooftop, he leaves one last peck on your lips then flew away once more to save the world.

What brings you here?” you said “Well me and the other allies are having a meeting to bring peace. They said you can come to the meeting.” He said You nodded and then you both walked to where the meeting was being held. “Bonjour madam” France said taking your hand and kissed it You blushed slightly and you turned to see America glaring daggers at France. “Hello America.” France said “Let’s go we were waiting for you America.” France wrapped an arm around your shoulders and led you inside. America was walking behind glaring at France. You moved away from France and went to hug your best friend Canada. You stood next to Canada while everyone else discussed the meeting. ~After the Meeting~ You were talking to Canada when France came up to you. “Madam Will you do me the honor of being my girlfriend?” he asked taking out a rose You were about to reply when America came up to all of you. He wrapped his arms around your waist and crashed his lips to yours. You at first were shocked but soon got over it and began to kiss back. France left angry that America had kissed you. You both pulled away for air and stared into each other eyes. “Like France said will you do me the honor of being my girlfriend?” he asked Your answer was kissing him again. Who knew jealousy could make a new couple.

You hear a thump come from the bottom of the stairs. You rush out to see what happened. Niall sat on the bottom step rubbing his shin. “What did you do?” you ask with one eyebrow raised “I was trying to slide down the fence thingy!” he points to the hand rail. “Well that was a silly thing to wasn’t it?” you ask picking him up “Thank you (Y/N),” Niall smiles adorably You grab a band aid and cover where he is bleeding. “And this is another reason why I love you (Y/N),” Niall smiles at you as you look up from his knee. “I love you too Niall,” you smile sweetly ~11 years later when Niall is 18~ You were over at Niall’s childhood home seeing his brother Greg. Even though you had baby sat him as well, you two were like best friends. You were just about to grab the front door handle when someone opened it from the outside. “Niall?” you asked smiling to yourself. “Hey (Y/N)!” he picks you up and spins you around “Last time I saw you, you couldn’t even lift me off the ground by a millimeter!” you giggle “Now look how high you lifted me” “You know, I still love you.” He smiles “I love you too.” You lean down and kiss his soft bubbly lips.

You begin to get angry “Hey! I’m not rich, like you, some people have to actually work to make a difference.” You say bluntly. You squeeze his hand and walk out the door. You loved Liam he’s been your best friend for as long as you could remember, but sometimes he seemed so ignorant. He had so much money but never used it to make a difference, he only ever partied. That made you sick, you worked your ass off as a cop to make a difference but Liam paid no regards to that, and what his family name once stood for. You arrived at work and everyone seems to be panicking. You calm one person down and ask them to explain. It was a gang; the same gang you’ve been tracking for months now, only now they were planning something big. You rush out with the fleet of other cops surrounding the building they are now in. you sneak away from the fleet taking back alleys, you’re tired of playing around you’re going to find out what needs to be found. As you made your way through alleys you stop by a vent, you can hear voices. The criminals talk, they’ve got the island wired and they’re planning on blowing it up. The realization of how much danger you are truly in came across you and you begin to quickly make your way back to where you came from, but when you turn there is a tall man standing in front of you. You recognized him in an instant, he was the gang leader. “Where are you going pretty lady?” he said grabbing your wrist with one hand and holding a gun with the other. He takes you into the room where the others are “Torture sounds like a good plan for this beauty.” He says as he grins psychotically. You scream in hopes that the cops would stop ‘we have the building surrounded, we’ll get them when they come out method’ and would just go in. Suddenly the room went pitch black and you hear the sound of beatings, and someone grabs you. A deep voice says “Don’t be afraid,”. The masked figure picks you up and leads you to a roof a building close, but still away from the violence. You look at your hero; it was Batman, creepiest good guy you’ve ever heard of. All you could see were his eyes; they looked sincere. He started to walk away “Wait! You could die, just tell me who you are” he turned around and looked you in the eyes and said something. He said two words, not just any two words; two words of and an inside joke you and Liam have. You knew right away it was him and you couldn’t help but let tears fill your eyes as he jumped off the building. Meanwhile everyone was evacuating the island, after you had commanded them to. You probably were the last one on the island besides Batman and the gang members. You ran like crazy to get off the island and eventually made it back to main land. You cried as you watched the whole island explode, you cried for Liam. But a strange thing happened. As you walked away cause you couldn’t bear to watch, but the bat mobile came sprinting out of the flames and across the bridge. The next morning you laid in bed, you were still under the impression that Liam was gone and it saddened you. There’s a knock on the door. It takes everything you have, but you get up to open the door. You open it and there stands Liam, in complete shock you blurt out “I love you” really quickly, you were just so happy to see him. He smiled at you “So am I still no good..?” he said rubbing his neck and kicking nervously. You looked up and found his eyes; you put your hands around his neck and passionately kissed him. The two pairs of lips parted and you stood there for a moment, forehead to forehead, nose to nose. He stepped away holding both your hands, squeezed them with a smirk, and simply walked off.

He gave you a kiss on the cheek and went to find some food. Zayn was your boyfriend of a year now, he was a test pilot, and handsome, the only downside he ever had was he was a bit on the cocky side, but you loved him wither way for it. The next morning the two of you woke up, ate breakfast, normal morning routine. Zayn got ready to leave “Kay see you later babe, gotta go save the world and enjoy life with my test pilot and stuff” he said with a smirk and wink as he walked out the door. You stared at the door with a dazed look trying to link his statement together, but the rolled your eyes and carried on. When he came home, Zayn was not acting normal; you could tell something happened at work. “Zayn, baby, what’s wrong” you said to him sitting beside him on the bed. “Nothing I’m fabulous” he said and turned away “You’re always on my case!” he yelled randomly and threw something to you. You picked it up. It’s a ring. You looked at him puzzled “Yeah, I’m a lantern now, whatever the heck that means, I get to keep peace and stuff” he says angrily. You calm him down and he tells you exactly what happened and he explains that it scares him, that it’s too much pressure. Eventually, you convince him to do it. The whole day he was gone and you worried about him. Superhero, it sounded dangerous and you started to wonder why you talked him into doing it in the first place. Still you loved that he let his confident walls down and shared that he was scared to do it. He finally came home. He looked a mess tangled wet hair from sweat and he was bleeding (it was actually kinda hot). You rushed over and helped him to the sofa. You started dabbing his wounds with a wet paper towel and looked at him “Don’t do this to yourself, you’re human they’re not, they will understand, you can’t do this!” you said to him. He shook his head. You were confused, because if this was last night the response would have been something “Hell yeah! I’m not doing this,” but now he seemed so serious. “I understand now. I have to do this, I know I’m human but they need a human. It’s to protect the peace babe, they need me.” He said sternly, but sincerely. You watched him limp to limp to the bedroom, the sight sadden you but you understood, and let him be. The next morning you wake up and he’s already gone. You turn on the news and don’t believe what you see. The city was under, attack, but there was your Green Lantern fighting. You couldn’t stand to sit there and watch him fighting. Eventually the fighting stopped, the attackers left, but the shot you see is Green Lantern lying on the crumpled street. You freak at this sight and run out of the house. You just run, not exactly positive what you’re going to do just hope to find him. Finally you meet the intersection you saw him lying when you saw him on the television. Without thinking you run up to him, grab his feet and begin dragging him to an alley. You knew no one could see you with him, it would blow his secret identity, so you dragged him. Once in the alley you threw yourself onto his chest sobbing. Then you felt a hand wrap around your back. You paused and looked up. Zayn was looking down at you smiling, and this sight immediately put a smile on your face. Tears came out of your eyes, but this time they were of happiness. You got off him and helped him sit up. The two of you sat on the street; you wrapped yourself around his neck, giving him a massive hug. “I thought I lost you” you say into his neck. He pulls you away gently “I know, I thought so too.” He said looking into your eyes, before grabbing your face and pulling you in for a massive and passionate kiss.

You have to let it happen.” Niall had called the quits on his and (Y/N)’s relationship. (Y/N) ended up getting together with someone she met from back in the states. However it was tearing Niall apart, and he was crying to the lads. Harry perked up, “I disagree. I saw her last week. I don’t think she’s very happy…” “What?” Niall looked at Harry “Yeah…,” Harry murmured slowly, “I think that she’s just doing this to get over you. She was in love with you, too.” Liam gave Harry a look, but Niall smiled, “I’m going.” Before anybody could even say anything, Niall had left and was running down the road to the chapel. He burst in the front door, in the middle of the ceremony, and running up the aisle before halting. “What the hell?” (Y/N)’s fiancé shouted dropping, (Y/N)’s hands and staring at Niall “GET OUT!” “No,” Niall said standing his ground, and the congregation gasped “I’m in love with you, (Y/N).” Niall sentimented, “I have been in love with you. Always have. If I can’t have you, then I’ll never fall again for someone like you, and I swear, I’ll spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel as half as good as you make me feel.” “Niall…,” (Y/N) started, taking a step towards him. “Don’t you dare!” her fiancé shouted, giving her a sharp yank back towards the altar. “Don’t touch her like that!” Niall yelled, running up the stairs to the stage and swopping her off her feet. “(Y/N),” Niall whispered, “Will you marry me? Right here? Right now?” (Y/N) looked at him and nodded, “Yes!” Much to the shock of her fiancé, but to the joy of her family, she wed Niall. Right then, right there. She became the new Mrs. Horan.

WOW the view was that beautiful. You turned around and continued walking, when you tripped. A tall, handsome man caught you and smirked at you. "Be more careful, babe. Haha my name's Harry Styles? Yours?" "(Y/N) and don't call me babe again." He just laughed and replied "A beautiful name for a beautiful girl." He smirked. You laughed and replied "Haha cheesy much?" You both laughed. ^First Kiss^ You two were on a date, but you didn't want to call it a date, because you had a fiancée. It was a cold night. Harry had put his coat over your shoulders and hugged you from behind. You were all warm and you were smiling look over the water. Harry turned your head and leaned down to kiss you. You two slowly fell in love. After the first date you told him about your fiancée and how you were being forced to marry him. At first harry was angry that you were being forced to marry someone you didn't love, but soon was happy when you called off the engagement. You had caught your fiancée cheating on you with your childhood best friend. You slipped the ring off your finger and told them you were calling off the engagement and told them that you loved someone else. ^Sinking Ship^ You wake up hearing a commotion going on and got off you bed. The water was already up to your knees! You immediately ran to Harry's room and started banging on the door. Harry opened the door, pulled you into a hug, grabbing your wrist, and ran up to the deck. You both got into a life boat. There was a little boy screaming for help in the water. So Harry, jumped in the water, saved the kid, and got back on the life boat. He laid his head on your lap, grabbed your hand placing it on his chest, and he shivered. "T-This he-heart only belongs to you. I love-" you hold onto his hands and start blowing on them trying to keep warm. "Harry, stay. Don't leave me please. I love you." You shake him. "Harry. Harry?! NO! No no no no NOOO!" you immediately hug him and start sobbing. You kiss his temple. "I love you, Harry. Forever and Always." ^Future^ After harry died you went to America, and became an actress. Eventually you married someone else, but they never filled the spot Harry had. You had 2 children a boy and a girl. Both who you named in his honor. Your time on the ship gave you time to talk about the future, and he told you what he would name his future children. Your son is the oldest and you named him Harry Edwards and your daughter Darcy Anne. Your son was named after your love who died on the titanic in your arms. And your daughter named what he would call his first daughter. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^Liam Payne^ ^How You Met^ You ran to the tip of the boat and you were about to jump, but a tall, handsome, young man yelled "DON'T if you jump, I'm jumping in to save you too! That water is COLD! It'll hit you like billions of knives!" "Go away! You're distracting me!" "Well, if you're going, I'm gonna have to go too, because I'm now involved in this too. Just give me your hand." You looked down and grabbed his hand. He pulled you on top of him and sighed in relief. "I'm sorry for being bothersome." "You're not bothersome. You're beautiful. Don't let anyone tell you different." You smile "Thanks" He laughs "Name's Liam Payne, and you are? ....." "(Y/N. My name s (Y/N)." you smiled. ^First Kiss^ You two fell in love slowly, but never kissed. Liam told you to close your eyes and told you to trust him and to do as he says. You agreed. He led you to where you two first met, but this time it was memorable. He told you to put your arms up like a T, and you did. You laugh and say "I feel like I'm flying!" He laughs and tells you to open your eyes. You did and you were amazed by the view. You turned your head over your shoulder to look at him. Your eyes locked with his. He leaned down slowly and your lips touched and he kissed you sweetly at the tip of the boat. ^Sinking Ship^ You were sleeping until you heard commotion. You got off the bed and set your feet in cold water. The water was almost up to the bed, which was about butt level. You immediately start trudging through the water and yelling for Liam. You eventually find and hug him tightly. "I have something to tell you." He told you as he hugged you back, and dragged you to one of the life boats. Liam reassured you that everything will be alright, he gave you a hug and kissed you passionately before you went on the boat. He faked a smile while you were crying. The next day, they found his body. You hugged his body closely and started sobbing. You saw that his hand was in a fist. You opened his fist and saw that there was an engagement ring there. You kissed his temple, and continued sobbing. "I love you" you say. Taking the engagement ring you kept with you. ^Future^ After you arrived in America you never married anyone after Liam. You never had the heart to marry anyone after you saw the engagement ring in his fist. You became a singer and a dancer and you had changed your name to Payne and kept the engagement ring on a necklace around your neck which you kept everywhere you go. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^ Louis Tomlinson^ ^How You Met^ You were having dinner with the first class people. It was awfully quiet and BORING. So you threw food at your fiancée and ducked. Your fiancée immediately ran after you, but he didn't catch up, because you were laughing and running on the deck. As you ran, you kept turning back to see if your fiancée had caught up and then you run into a handsome man. Your eyes locked with his until he broke the silence. "You okay there, love? Haha the name's Louis Tomlinson. Yours?" You blushed and say "(Y/N) I gotta go! Nice talking to ya!" You ran into a room close by. ^First Kiss^ (Starting from where you two met) It was quiet. So you ran and fell on top of that Louis guy again. This time your lips were planted right onto each other's. You blushed and got up. "I'm sorry." "Oh it's okay." He smirked and hugged you. From that day on, you two started hanging out, and slowly fell in love. You broke on the engagement with your fiancée since he wanted you only for your money and he didn't like that you were carefree and a bit childish. ^Sinking Ship^ You were sleeping, and then you heard knocking on your door. You went to open it, and the workers informed you that the ship was sinking. You yell "LOUIS!" you immediately shoved the worker, and ran to the deck looking for Louis. Louis hugged you and started kissing you. He got you on a life boat and told you that there was another boat waiting for him. You both stared at each other. He did a fake smile while you were coming. You jumped back onto the ship, ran to the deck, and hugged him. He hugged back and kissed you. You two stayed until the WHOLE ship sank. He lets you go on a wooden door, but he didn't go on it, because it could only hold one person. He kissed your temple and held your hand tightly. You two waited for someone to come for both of you. Louis stutters. "I-I l-l-l-love-"you called Louis, but he wouldn't wake up. "Louis! Louis! Louis, please wake up? You can't leave me without a good-bye! Louis!" You kissed his temple and said "I love you." You immediately break down crying and sobbing loudly as the seamen pulled you into the life boat. You held onto Louis hand as the seamen paddled the boat, both of your hands slowly loosen until your hands are no longer holding on each other's. ^Future^ You became an actress after the sinking of the titanic. It was hard for you to get over Louis, and to marry someone else. Eventually you did and have a son with your husband. You named your son Louis. You never spoke to your husband about the titanic, and sometimes you think back to your times on the ship. You had a journal that you wrote about your times there and only after you had left the journal to your son did he find out about Louis. Your son published the journal that was made into a book that told yours and Louis story and love when the titanic sank. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^Niall Horan^ ^How You Met^ During a food fight at dinner, I caked a cute blonde's face, and ran. He started chasing you. Until he caught you by grabbing your wrist, he laughed and said "Haha Got Cha! Haha my name's Niall yours?" you giggled and replied "(Y/N)." ^First Kiss^ Niall invited you to have tea with him privately. So you went. After tea, right when you were about to open the door knob, he grabbed you by your wrist, turned you around, and kissed you. You wrapped your arms around his neck and enjoyed the kiss. From that day on, you two fell in love. Also having tea privately and having some kisses here and there when you had tea. ^Sinking Ship^ You heard banging on the door, you got up and opened it, and Niall immediately grabbed your wrist and dragged you to the deck. He put you on a life boat. You two stared at each other while they were lowering the life boat. Your eyes started getting teary while Niall had a fake smile plastered to his face. The next morning Niall's body was found. They said that Niall was a hero for saving a little girl. You immediately fell onto your knees beside Niall's body, hugging him. "Niall, please wake up?! Don't leaven me!" you kissed his lips and gave him one last hug and said "I love you." You held his hand as your dad pulled you away from Niall's body. As your dad was pulling you away, your hands being too slowly loosen until your hands are no longer holding onto each other. ^Future^ You became a famous chef after you arrived in America. You didn't marry anyone after you saw Niall's body even though your family wanted you to. Your restaurants were all in memory of those who died in the titanic. You hardly ever spoke of your time on the ship, but you never forgot Niall. You sometimes dream yourself back on the titanic and you would you would see Niall. It was until the day you died that you and Niall were reunited again, and it was on the grand staircase of the titanic where you two reunited again, and this time forever. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^Zayn Malik^ ^How You Met^ A good looking guy with black hair had caught your attention. He kept glancing at you and doing something on his note pad. You went to him and asked "What's your problem? Stop staring at me." He laughs "My name's Zayn Malik. I wasn't staring as you THAT way. I was drawing you ........" you ran behind him and stared at the drawing. "Oh ...... sorry. I didn't-"he looked behind his shoulder *where you are standing* and your eyes locked. ^First Kiss^ (Starting from where you two met) He kissed you. You blushed and enjoyed it. From that day on, you two hung out almost 24/7 and slowly fell in love. Zayn and you broke the kiss and went to Zayn's room. He asked you if he could finish drawing you, and you said yes. Both of you walked to his room and he began to draw you again. ^Sinking Ship^ Zayn was still drawing you. He had messed up on his picture and left a black mark through your face. You laugh and say "Wow what was that?" "We can always do it again." Then, a worker banged on the door. You two answered the door, the worker said the ship was sinking, you were handed a life belt, and then ran to the deck. You stayed on the ship until the WHOLE thing had sunk. You couldn't find Zayn since the two of you were separated in the water. You did your vest by yelling and swimming around, but it was hopeless. The seaman grabbed you and pulled you onto the life boat. The next day, they find Zayn's body. You sit beside Zayn and started sobbing and hugging him. You saw that his hand was in a tight fist. You opened up his fist, and saw that it was the two pictures that he drawn the one was the first time you two met and the other picture that he messed up on when the ship was sinking. You kissed his temple, and started sobbing. "I love you with all my heart." You say as you hold his hand while sobbing. ^Future^ You became an artist since it was a way to be close to Zayn after his death. You drew pictures and made paintings of your time on the titanic and your time with Zayn. You did marry someone eventually, but the love that you and your husband wasn't the same as yours and Zayn's love. You never told him about Zayn, and when they asked for your name you said your was (Y/N) Malik. And even to the day they asked you about your time on the titanic. Like they say a woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets. And your secret was Zayn Malik.

You giggled softly as he pulled into his lap, him smiling widely. “I love you,” he mumbled into her hair “I love you too.” You don’t even have a chance to sit up, his arm is so comfortably tight around your it’s near impossible. “Come on, Ni.” Yousoothes pushing the strands of blonde hair from his forehead. “Nu uh.” You smiles “But I have to use the bathroom.” His arm let’s you have a bit of room but you still can’t get out. “I don’t want you to go.” The Irish boy states with a pout on his pink lips. “I’ll be 5 minutes.” “Fine,” he drawls letting her go. “Will you hurry? I can’t sleep without you.” “Okay, I’ll hurry.” The couch is beneath your back and you can’t stop laughing, due to the long fingers that kept tickling your ribs. “Let go!” you screeched, and laughing again when his fingers ran up to your belly button. He wrapped his arms tighter around you, resting his head above your heart. “I think I’ll just stay here a little longer, “he murmurs softly, “You’re warm and really comfy.” Chapter 29 : Over Protective Dad*Harry Styles* Summary: Key: (Y/F/N) or (Y/N)- Your First Name or Your Name (Y/L/N)- Your Last Name (H/C)- Hair Color (H/L)- Hair Length (E/C)- Eye Color (F/C)- Favorite Color (F/D)- Favorite Drink (F/F)- Favorite Flower (F/P)- Favorite Place (H/L)- Hair Length (F/B)- Favorite Breakfast (F/L)- Favorite Lunch (F/D)- Favorite Dinner (F/O)- Favorite Outfit (Y/A)- Your Age “Remember,” I grabbed Harry’s hand as I drove over to my parent’s house, “What do we tell my father?” Harry giggled, reciting from memory the mini speech I had him prepare. “We are not sleeping together, we have separate apartments, and I make sure you’re in your bed by midnight because I respect your space. I have the utmost intentions with your daughter, and fully intend on pursing a future.” Harry looked at me and grinned, proud of himself. I let out a nervous sigh, “It’s a good start.” “Psh,” Harry scoffed, as I turned down the street to my parent’s house, “Your parents will love me. I’m great with dads,” Harry was obviously proud of himself. I muttered under my breath, “We’ll see about that…” I pulled up to my parent’s house, and there was my dad. Cleaning his shot gun mindlessly on the porch. I looked at Harry. Who had gone white, and I giggled. “Alright charmer. Go make him fall in love with you.” Chapter 30 : They Don’t Know About Us*Harry Styles* Summary: Key: (Y/F/N) or (Y/N)- Your First Name or Your Name (Y/L/N)- Your Last Name (H/C)- Hair Color (H/L)- Hair Length (E/C)- Eye Color (F/C)- Favorite Color (F/D)- Favorite Drink (F/F)- Favorite Flower (F/P)- Favorite Place (H/L)- Hair Length (F/B)- Favorite Breakfast (F/L)- Favorite Lunch (F/D)- Favorite Dinner (F/O)- Favorite Outfit (Y/A)- Your Age A small moan with pleasure escaped my lips as Harry continued to massage my tense muscles. “That feels amazing, babe,” I cooed, my eyes fluttering shut. “I’m glad I can be of service for you Giselle,” he whispers, continuing his task. I giggled softly, leaning back to kiss the corner of his lips softly. It’s because he just really doesn’t want to let go, so he holds onto me a little tighter and nuzzles his nose into my neck, breathing in my scent and allowing his muscles to relax after a long day. “You can let go now,” I said softly, yet I threaded my fingers through his hair in a soothing stroking manner. “But I just got you,” he mumbled back, “Not going to let go yet.” Harry’s arm winds up around my waist as I settle into bed. There’s no right or left side to the bed with Harry, just the two of us sprawled across the middle of the mattress. Our legs tangled together, both of us wearing minimal clothing so we have the excuse to keep each other warm. His breathing comes slow and even, but I can tell he isn’t asleep yet when he restlessly stirred against me, his strong arms pulling me along to wherever he shifts to. “Can’t sleep?” I asked him, my softly slurred speech revealed how tired I was myself. “No,” he pouts childishly. Laughing softly at him, I raised my hand to his curls, gently running my fingers through the soft locks. He sighs contently, nuzzling his head into my touch. “Better?” I asked, grinning as I watched his eyelids fall close. Plump lips are lazily pressed to the base of my jaw. “Much better.” Chapter 31 : Video Games*Louis Tomlinson* Summary: Key: (Y/F/N) or (Y/N)- Your First Name or Your Name (Y/L/N)- Your Last Name (H/C)- Hair Color (H/L)- Hair Length (E/C)- Eye Color (F/C)- Favorite Color (F/D)- Favorite Drink (F/F)- Favorite Flower (F/P)- Favorite Place (H/L)- Hair Length (F/B)- Favorite Breakfast (F/L)- Favorite Lunch (F/D)- Favorite Dinner (F/O)- Favorite Outfit (Y/A)- Your Age “Whatcha playing?” you ask, sitting beside Louis Louis barley gives you a sideways glance. “Black Opps.” he mutters, and violently pushes the buttons.

He cheers to himself, and starts a new game. Eventually, knowing that you were going to get no attention from Louis that night, you grab a controller, and join the game. He eyes you, and takes the headset off. “Babe, what are you doing?” he asks. “I’m about to kick your ass in this game.” You tell him “What? You’ve never played this before.” “I’m a fast leaner.” You boast He only chuckles. “Fine.” He resumes the game. “Now all you gotta do is just shoot red-“ he starts, but he cuts himself off when he has to start over due to being killed. “Like that?” you ask, smirking Louis looks down at you, shocked. “Did you just kill me?” he asks You shrug. “This game is easy Lou. Do you have anything more challenging?” you tease him, and you can hear Harry laughing from the headset around Louis’ neck.

You had moved from America to Karakura town after the death of your family. Ichigo had been your first friend here. You had always been able to see spirits since you were a child. You knew that Ichigo was a soul reaper since your cousins were ones. You cousins had died in a ‘fire’ that had started at their work. And the rest of your family was killed by hollows in America. It hurt you when you heard that your cousins didn’t make it. But you knew it wasn’t a fire that killed them it was the hollow that killed the rest of your family. That was the whole reason you had all moved to Karakura to lose the hollows, but they found you all. You walked to the secret place you only knew about. You always seemed to notice that Ichigo’s friends were a bit different since they were soul reapers. You said nothing about knowing everything from soul society since you didn’t want to get involved. ~At Your Secret Place~ Your secret place was a lake surrounded by cherry blossom trees. You came here whenever you were troubled r just for the peace and quiet. You sat down under a tree near the water, and you took out of your bag your sketch book. Your sketches were of the Soul Society and Hueco Mundo. That was your power to see both worlds through your dreams. You began sketching when you heard a large roar. You looked up and saw a huge coming out of a garganta through the sky. The hollow turned to look at you sensing spiritual pressure and began to approach you. Since the hollow’s spiritual pressure was too much for you so you stayed frozen in place. “Reign over the frosted heavens, Hyorinmaru!” someone yelled. A huge ice dragon appeared and frozen the hollow. Then the ice shattered where the hollow used to be. You a white haired guy that was friends with Ichigo. He was by the looks of it a soul reaper a captain. The guy turned to you and stared hard at you with his piercing teal eyes. Before he could say anything Ichigo came. Ichigo looked at you before it clicked in his mind. “(Y/N) you can see us can’t you?” he asked holding his sword You nod “My cousins were soul reapers before hollows killed them.” “I always did sense something about you. Since we first met you and your cousins were different. But the one who saved you is Toshiro Hitsugaya.” Ichigo said to you “That’s Captain Hitsugaya to you Kurosaki.” He said glaring at Ichigo Ichigo rolled his eyes “Whatever. (Y/N) do you have any special abilities?” he asked “Yeah I can draw and see through my dreams the Soul Society and Hueco Mundo.” You told them They both nod then Ichigo looks at Toshiro and I get my stuff together. Then you all go back Urahara’s shop where you meet the rest of the soul reapers. After your hollow attack Toshiro became very protective of you. He also only let you call him by his first name since you were the ONLY one who called him Captain Hitsugaya. Renji and Ichigo had a bet going on saying you both would be a couple. You did become a couple after Grimmjow tried to hurt you in an attack. Ichigo saved you and Toshiro stayed by your side since you got hurt badly by Grimmjow and Yammy. Renji lost the bet after he and Ichigo followed you to your secret place where you and Toshiro first kissed. That also became the spot where he proposed to you then you went to the soul society back with him when he had to go back.

The teachers had informed the students of the Yule Ball. It was a few weeks before the ball and people were going to Hogsmeade to shop. “(Y/N)! Are you ready to go to Hogsmeade?” Ginny asked “Yeah. Ginny who are you going to the ball with?” you asked “I’m going with Neville. Who are you going with?” she asked “No one has asked me yet.” You said sadly You were hoping that your longtime friend/crush asked you. Frederick Gideon Weasley. You both arrived at Hogsmeade and headed to the dress shop. It took a while but you both found the perfect dresses. After you paid for both dresses you both went to The Three Broomsticks. ~*~At The Three Broomsticks~*~ You and Ginny sat at a table, order some butterbeers and started talking. You talked for a while when your two best friends came and sat down at the table. “Well hello there girls.” George said “Fancy seeing you both here.” Fred said “Well people came to buy clothes for the ball. Also to have a good time.” Ginny said rolling her eyes “Do you both already have dates?” George asked ignoring his sister “I’m going with Neville. Who are you both going with?” Ginny asked “Katie Bell.” George said smiling “Angelina Johnson.” Fred said smiling goofily You stayed quiet and just sipped your butterbeer your heart shattered into pieces. You knew he always had a crush on her, but them got to the Yule Ball killed you. Ginny looked at you knowingly and she decided to change the subject quickly. “Do you think Harry will win the tournament?” she asked her two older brothers “Probably.” George said “He won against the dragon and the lake challenge.” Fred said next You stayed quiet listening to the conversation sipping your butterbeer. You were thinking of who would go to the ball with you. The four of walked back to the castle and headed to the Great Hall to eat something. After dinner you all went separate ways the twins going to prank some slytherins and most likely Snape also. You and Ginny were walking back to the common room when one of the Drumstrang students started to approach you. You and Ginny stopped and looked at each other and let him walk up to you. “Hello my name is Demetri. Vould you love to go to the Yule Ball vith me.” He asked taking my hand in his. You looked at Ginny and then smiled saying yes. Demetri bowed, kissed your hand then walked back to where he saw some of his friends and they started congratulating him. Ginny and you started walking back to the common room while she looked at you. “You’re going with a Drumstrang student.” Ginny said “He is cute, and I have a date to the ball which I’m happy about.” You said back to her “True but I thought you would have gone with Fred or something.” She said entering the portrait hole “Well he’s going with Angelina so no plus he only sees me as a friend.” You told her following after her and sitting in one of the sofas. You both continued talking going up to the staircase to homework put the things you bought at Hogsmeade away and get some homework from the professors to finish in the common room. That’s when the portrait opened and the twins walked in laughing. They sat down on a different sofa near us. “What are you two laughing about?” Ginny asked looking up from her DADA homework You looked up as well from your potions homework to hear their response. “We pranked Malfoy and his friends.” Fred said laughing “And we also pranked Snape by adding a cleaning spell to his classroom and enchanted a soap bottle to chase him saying ‘Let me wash your hair you greasy big nosed git’ and it chased him around the whole dungeon.” You and Ginny both started laughing at the image of Snape running from a soap bottle. When you all calmed down you continued doing homework while talking to the three gingers. “I can’t wait for the ball already.” Fred said thinking of his date “We know you can’t wait to see Angelina Fred.” Ginny said rolling her eyes “Hey (Y/N) who are you going to the ball with?” George asked You looked up from your homework blushing lightly “I’m going with a Drumstrang student. He asked me when me and Ginny were coming back to the common room.” Fred looked over to you shocked and George and Ginny both had a serious face on. That’s when they both said at the same time “He better not hurt you or we’re hexing his arse off.” You laughed and nodded at the two of them, and you looked over at Fred who was still looking at you. You looked back at him and raised an eyebrow. “Something wrong Fred?” You asked him looking back Ginny and George who were both now talking about quidditch. “Harry is going against a Drumstrang champion and you’re going with the enemy.” He said looking at you slightly angry but in reality it was mostly jealously Your jaw dropped in shock and angry that your friend who knew for a while was getting mad for a date to a ball. You started grabbing your things and looked at Fred and Ginny and George were still oblivious to the argument. “Honestly Fred just because someone from another school asked me to the ball doesn’t mean they are the enemy. So you may think I’m going with the enemy, but I can make my own decisions.” After you clutched your things storming up to the girl’s staircase. ~*~Three Days Later~*~ You walked into the common room and saw Harry laying down one the couch in front of the fire place with the golden egg on his chest. "Having trouble?" You asked Harry as you sat down by his feet. "Yeah. I can't find out what the clue is in this thing" Harry said. "It's all right, Ron. It's okay, Ron. It's all right. It doesn't matter" Ginny told Ron as she with one of her friends guide Ron into the room. Harry sat up. "What happened to you?" Harry asked Ron. "He just asked Fleur Delacour out" Ginny said as she help Ron sit in one of the chairs. Hermione who was reading a book got up along with Harry and walked over to Ron. "What?" Hermione asked. "What did she say?" Harry asked. You walked over to them. "No, of course" Hermione said. Ron shook his head. "She said yes?" Hermione asked covering her mouth with her hands. "Don't be silly. There she was, walking by. You know how I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it. It just sort of slipped out" Ron said. "Actually, he sort of screamed at her. It was a bit frightening" Ginny said. "And what did you do then?" Harry asked. "What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this, Harry. I don't know what got into me" Ron said. The Patil twins walked passed Harry and told him hi. You nudged him with your elbow and nodded your head at them. Harry got what you were saying. "Hey!" Harry said walking after them. ~*~HP~*~ It was the night of the Yule ball. All day you were in your dorm room as you fixed your hair and make up for the ball. Your dress was basically Elsa's from the movie Frozen. You basically were a ice queen. You were just about done with your hair and makeup. It was an hour before the ball to start. After you was satisfied with how you looked you began to walk slowly towards the door. You made it down the staircase and in to the common room. You were going to meet Demetri outside of the Great Hall, along with the twins and their dates. You walked out of the common room and down the grand stair case carefully. You finally made it to the bottom. You saw Fred and Demetri staring at you with their mouths dropped open. You felt your cheeks heat up. But you walked over to Demetri shyly. "Vov. You look beautiful" Demetri said. "Thank you" you said blushing. "Wow" you heard George said. Fred, Demetri, and you turned towards him. Your mouth opened a little at what you saw. Angelina and Katie was walking over to us. They looked *cough*slutty*cough* in their dresses. "Hello (Y/N). You look beautiful in your dress" they both said. "Thanks and you do too" I said. "You're beautiful" George blurted out to Katie. "Thank you, George" Katie said with blush forming on her cheeks. "Shall ve go?" Demetri asked holding out his elbow for you. "We shall" You said grabbing his elbow. Unknown to you Fred looked at Demetri in jealousy, but he decided to copy Demetri's action with Angelina. Both you and Demetri walked into the Great Hall that was decorated like it was made of ice. "Everyone make a walk way" Professor McGonagall said making students get out of the way. "The theme matches my dress." You told Demetri pointing to the decorations. Demetri smiled and looked at you. "Yes, vou make a beautiful ice queen" Demetri said. "Thank you" You said with blush on cheeks from the compliment. "Don't be shy. You are very beautiful." Demetri said. The Great Hall doors opened and the champions with their dates walked through. Everyone started to clap. Fleur was in front with her date. You believed it was Roger Davies and he was in Ravenclaw. Then there was Viktor Krum with Hermione as his date. Hermione looked beautiful in her dress. Next was Cedric with Cho and finally Harry and his date Parvati. Parvati also looked beautiful in her dress. When all the champions got to the dance floor they started to dance. Professor McGonagall and Professor Dumbledore walked out on to the dance floor and started to dance. "I believe there is a romance between them two" Demetri whispered to you. You nodded. Soon everyone joined the dance floor. "Care to dance, m'lady?" Demetri asked you. "Of course kind sir." You said. "Thank you for the dance m'lady." Demetri said. "Anytime kind sir" You smiled. Demetri and you started to dance. Fred and Angelina also began to dance. Angelina started to talk to Fred who had his attention on you and Demetri. After three slow songs, Professor Filtwick called the Weird Sisters on stage. The Weird Sisters started to play Do the Hippogriff. "I love this song!" You screamed. "Vhat!" Demetri shouted. "I love this song!" You screamed again. "Me too!" Demetri shouted. You both moved to the back of the crowd so you could dance. You both danced for sometime before Fred came over and asked for a dance. Demetri and Fred traded partners before dancing with you. "I hope the night never ends" You said as Fred span you around. "Me neither" Fred said. "This is so much fun. I'm glad I cane to this ball with Demetri" You said. "I am too or I'll be like Ron over there. The only thing is that unlike Ron I actually danced with my date." Fred said nodding to where Ron sat. "Why would you be like a grumpy Ron for? You brought Angelina to the ball." You asked him. "I'm jealous of your date that's why." Fred said. "Why?" You asked him. "(Y/N), I have to tell you something" Fred said a little serious. "Okay, what is it?" You asked him. "In private" Fred said. "Okay. We can go outside" You said. Fred and You quit dancing and walked out of the Great Hall. You both passed a few students that was snogging and walked out of the school. You saw a few carriages rocking. "Can't people find a better place to do that?" You asked Fred. He shrugged his shoulders. You both stopped walking by the fountain. "I wished I had brought a coat" You said rubbing your hands on your arms. "Here" Fred said putting his coat over your shoulders. "Thanks" You said wrapping it closer to you. "(Y/N), I like you, more than a friend" Fred said with a blush on his cheeks. You froze. You weren't expecting Fred to say that. You always thought he had a crush on Angelina? He is nice and sweet. Also caring and cute. You always liked Fred more than a friend too you just never thought he had the same feelings for you. "I like you too. For a while now." you said blushing a deep red. "Y-you do?" Fred asked you. "Yes" You said shyly. "Would you be my girlfriend then?" Fred asked you. You shook your head yes. "That's great!" Fred said with a huge smile on his face. Fred hugged you. When you pulled away from the hug you froze and looked at each other. Fred moved a strand of your hair and put it behind your ear. The two of you then leaned towards each other. You closed your eyes as your lips touched. It felt like fireworks and electricity was going through your body as you both kissed. You both broke apart and looked over by some bushes that had started moving. "George!" I hissed. George smiled widely at the two of you. "It's about time you two." George said "This is awkward" Fred said rubbing the back of his neck. "Tell me about it" You said. George smiled at Fred for a minute and left. But before he left he shouted "Don't worry about your dates they both thought you both make a cute couple." "Let's get back inside. I'm cold" you said. "Okay" Fred said and wrapped one of his arms around your shoulder. You both walked into the warm castle. "Here" You told Fred handing him his coat. "Thanks" Fred said taking the coat. The two of you walked back into the Great Hall the Weird Sisters was playing This is the night. "I love this song!" You said. "I think you love all of there songs" Fred said smiling. "They're an awesome band" You said. "Fred! (Y/N)! Over here!" George shouted from where he, Katie, Ginny, and Neville sitting at. Fred and you walked over to them. Fred grabbed your hand. You both sat down. "Are you two together?" Ginny asked Fred and you. "Yes" Fred said with a big grin on his face. You cheeks turned a little pink. You noticed Katie frown a bit. "Finally. I was wondering when you two were" Ginny said and took a sip of her punch. "I'll be right back. I'm going to get some punch" You said. "I'll get you some." Fred said getting up. "Thanks" you said. Fred walked over to the punch bowl. "Oh, I'm also getting some for us." George said getting up and walking over to the snack table. Ginny and Neville went to go dance again leaving you and Katie alone at the table. "So you and Fred" Katie said. "Yeah" you said. "You shouldn't go out with him. You know Angelina loves him." Katie said "Katie" You began. "No. I don't want to be your friend anymore. Friends don't steal other friends crushes." Katie said and got up. Katie walked over to George and asked if he wanted to dance again. "Where did George and Katie go?" Fred asked. "To go dance" You muttered. "What's wrong?" Fred asked putting down your cup of punch. "Nothing" You said grabbing your cup of punch and drank some. "It doesn't look it" Fred said sitting next to you. "Katie and I had a little argument" you said. "You and Katie? What was it about?" Fred asked. "I'll tell you tomorrow, right now let's dance" You said. "Okay" Fred said standing up. You stood up. Fred and You walked to the dance floor and started to dance. You both danced until it was midnight. "I'd like to wish you all a happy Christmas and good night" Dumbledore said. There were only a few students left and a few teachers. Fred and you walked out of the Great Hall laughing. Hagrid tried to lower his hand down to Madam Maxine's bottom. "I think Hagrid has a crush on her" Fred laugh. "I know he does" You said. "How's that?" Fred asked you. "I can tell when someone has a crush on someone" You said. "No you don't. You couldn't tell I did or when Demetri did. Speaking of George what was it you and Katie arguing about?" Fred asked you. "Promise me you won't get mad" You said. "I promise" Fred said. You both stopped walking. You told Fred what Katie had said. "She's just mad, (Y/N). She'll get over it" Fred said. "You're not mad at her?" You asked him. "No. Well kind of yes I HAD a crush on Angelina, but I moved on. I realized my feelings for you." Fred said putting his arm over your shoulder. The two of you walked up to the common room. Fred gave you a kiss before walking up to his room. You walked up to yours. You walked into the bathroom with your wand and waved it at your hair. Your hair turned to it's regular look and your make up went away. You took the tiara and pins out of your hair and laid it down. You got out of your dress and shoes. You put your pajama on and walked out of the bathroom with your things. You placed your things in a small pocket in your trunk after shrinking them. You didn't want them to get lost or ruined in your trunk with all your things in it. You had to blush as you thought about what had happened at the ball. You placed the last of your things in your trunk walked back to your bed where you promptly fell asleep thinking this was the best ball ever.

"Cal, what's wrong, you've been off all day?" she asks, I feel as though I've been stabbed in the chest. How can I do this? How can I hurt her? She seems so concerned! I don't deserve her concern. I can't do it. "Nothing (Y/N), I'm fine, I promise baby." I smile. It's obviously not convincing though, because she frowns. "Nope, you're not! Babe, if something's wrong, tell me." "Okay, fine, you want to know?" I say, a little abruptly. She nods. "(Y/N), I think we should break up. What the magazines have been saying they're true. I cheated on you. I was drunk. " Lies all lies. Management want us over. They want me single. I see pain flash through her eyes. Then anger, hurt, heartbreak. She looks as though I'm tearing her apart, piece by piece, limb by limb. The only thing I won't do is apologize, say it was a stupid joke or a dare, take her in my arms and kiss the pain away. But I can't. I'm not allowed to. Management says so. I can't ruin the boy's careers. I care about them too much. I have to do this. (Y/N) will move on, unlike me. I love her, so much. It's killing me to leave her. But I have to. "And to think I loved you." She narrows her eyes. "I love you, (Y/N)! I really do! It's just...It's better for both of us." I plead with my eyes for her to forgive me. But she just makes it worse. "Calum I needed you! I love you. And you go ahead and cheated on me. Why was I not good enough?!" she begs, it hurts to see her like this. To hear the desperation in her voice. "(Y/N), I love you. I'll always love you. Just remember that that? I never meant to cheat on you." my voice is off. But I'm trying. She'll get better. She'll get over me. I know she will. She's strong. Stronger than me. "No." "Sorry?" I was stunned. Her insight had completely changed. "No, I won't remember that, because if I remember that, the flashbacks will come back, I'll see our relationship all the time and I don't need that, Calum. I don't' need any reminders. So, thanks, but no thanks. I love you too, now ba-bye." She offers a small wave and I can see anger in her eyes. She walked up to the front door as quickly as she can, picking up everything of hers on her way. Leaving her house keys behind. She murmurs something unintelligible before slipping out of the door. "I love you, (Y/N)." I mutter as I watch her slip away. Slip out of my life. There's not a single thing I can do about it. I fall to the floor, horrible, ragged breaths leaving my chest, my sobs carrying out through the house which feels so empty without her here. So, this is what feels like to be broken. I know she'll work through the pain. She'll get over it in time. It's what's best for her and for the boys. I don't matter, as long as they're all okay. I know there won't be any more late night phone calls. I'll never tell her I love her again, I won't be able to make her laugh or smile, she won't be my reason for living anymore. The tears cascade down my cheeks. But as long as she'll be happy, even if I'm not. I remember the day you told me you were leaving I remember the make-up running down your face And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them Like every single wish we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape If today I woke up with you right beside me Like all of this was just some twisted dream I'd hold you closer than I ever did before And you'd never slip away And you'd never hear me say ~Sorry it sucks and I hope you like it.

Well at least until he got the opportunity to become famous and be in The Wanted. You both miss each other lots but what gets you though is that he tries to visit you any and every time he has a chance. You even went on tour with him last summer but had to come back to finish college. You never told him but you developed a HUGE crush on him when you were on tour with him and figured out he hadn’t changed and that’s why your mushy feelings brought on bigger feelings. He just got back from LA and came to see you. He was still a little jet lagged so you went to the couch and turned on his favorite movie Inglorious Bastards. You two end up cuddling and the rest of the boys see, and Tom remarks “You both would be such a cute couple.” You blush knowing that’s right on the spot of your feelings. Nathan looks at you with a smirk and kisses you right on your mouth then pulls away mouthing “That’s a great idea.” Your cheeks get even redder knowing you two weren’t alone. The boys leave and soon you and Nathan both fall asleep. You on your stomach on him and him shirtless on his stomach under you. Max then comes back and snaps a picture of you two and soon it’s on Twitter with the caption “ Let’s me introduce Nathan and (Y/N) #thecutecouple!! ” Notes: Quotev http://www.quotev.com/story/2726905/Imagines/29 Wattpad https://www.wattpad.com/story/5792556-imagines DeviantArt http://animefanforever12.deviantart.com/gallery/47564166/Imagines Miss Literati http://www.missliterati.com/stories/imagines-54a4bc5e7fce544a0a0097d9
