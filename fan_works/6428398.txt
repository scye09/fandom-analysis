Can our safe-word be “I’m close”? What the what?! Rey sat up in bed, startled out of the fuzzy edges of sleep by the strange request suddenly dropped into her thoughts by a familiar but unwelcome presence in her mind. Next to her, Finn grumbled and rolled over, disturbed by her movements. She absentmindedly stroked his hair and he settled back in. on his other side, Poe slept like the dead. What’s wrong with you? She mentally snapped back at the voice in her mind with disgust. In response she got spluttering and the psychic equivalent of panicked arm flailing. What the- Oh Force! Wrong person! If the person sending the message had been speaking aloud, Rey was certain that his voice would have cracked embarrassingly during the outburst. And just like that, Kylo Ren shut off the force connection between them and disappeared from her mind as quickly as he had entered it. The young Jedi wondered for a moment if she should reach out after him to try and see if there was any useful information to be found out from the missed connection. Then Finn mumbled something sleepily and tugged on her hand, and she decided she didn’t really care what Kylo was doing at the moment. She was probably better off not knowing anyway.
