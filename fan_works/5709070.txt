Finn can sleep anywhere. Poe's seen him doze off on chairs and benches while the entire Resistance rockets around him at full volume, in the back of an x-wing, on the floor in someone else's room: head tipped down and Poe's jacket tucked around him tight, snoozing through anything. He seems to sleep worse on his own, like he can't get used to the quiet. Rey creates nests when she sleeps; she curls blankets all around herself, staff nearby, and wakes up at the sound of footsteps in the corridors, or doors opening down the hall. But she sleeps fine on ships, the hum of the engines a lullaby, knowing that the only other people who can come near are the ones she already knows, knowing that someone else is keeping watch. Poe has more space in his quarters than he knows what to do with, so it seems logical to invite them in. Him and Finn (and BB-8, mainly) don't mind keeping watch for Rey if she needs it, and him and Rey are fine with being Finn's reassurance. It means that he can come home to rooms filled with noise and life, and now? That's what he needs. Notes: This fic was originally posted at my dreamwidth account, feel free to come say hi!
