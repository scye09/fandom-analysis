Poe’s alive. Finn pulls him into his arms, hugging his body to him and totally not reveling in all the muscle pressing him against him that he totally wasn’t admiring a few days ago. They exchange pleasantries, before a cry of “Daddy” distracts them and a small boy runs up to Poe, snuggling against him as Poe lifts him up. A man follows him, and Poe kisses him on the cheek before turning back to Finn. “Buddy, can I introduce my husband, Temmin and my son Luke” Temmin’s kind of cute. His handshake is strong, with eyes saying “Step Off Son or you die”. He tries not to feel heartbroken. Sure, he knew he was falling fast for Rey, but he wouldn’t be as bi as he knew he was if he didn’t have a crush on Poe.
