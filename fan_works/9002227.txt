Something tickled. “Dammit, Ren, let me sleep” he muttered. He had a few moments peace and then he felt it again, feather light across his cheekbones. “This is the first day I’ve had off in months, and you will let me enjoy it in peace, or I swear you will regret it.” Miracle of miracles he managed to drift off again, but the touches began to intrude again, right when he was in the middle of a pleasant dream of sitting on a throne waving down at the cheering masses. He swatted at the annoyance, expecting to grab a finger and instead catching a stylus. “No.” Silence. “Ren, tell me you didn’t!” “Didn’t what?” How could such a scoundrel manage to look so innocent? “Stop batting your eyelashes at me, you nerf.” Throwing back the covers with stylus in hand he stormed in to the refresher, swearing at what he saw in the mirror. "REN!" “I told you there were constellations across your cheekbones, Hux! No, Hux, don't murder me!” Notes: Feel free to come say hi on tumblr!
