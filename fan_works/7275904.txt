"I won't stand for this!" Kylo shouted, throwing his helmet to the floor. "You can't do this! It's idiotic!" "Idiotic, maybe, but it will bring eventual peace and order," Hux said smoothly, ignoring Kylo's outburst. He severely contrasted his husband, who was slouched over and glowering; dark and angry. "And you need to heed my decisions." "I love you, and I cannot allow you to endanger yourself!" "Kylo," Hux mumbled to himself. He walked up to the dark haired man, and stroked his knight's cheek. "I love you too, my dear , but you must respect my choice." "I cannot stand guard while you try to negotiate with those hostile, slimy beings! You could-" "-die, yes, i am aware. But I won't, not with you watching, my love," Hux purred, kissing Kylo's cheek. Kylo scoffed. "You know the risk, yet you're still going through with it." "I'm the emperor, I must." "Don't you love me?" Kylo asked meekly. He was so wanting. So needy. Hux could barely keep his groan of annoyance inside. "Yes. However, I have a galaxy to rule and keep in order. I would rather pursue billions of lives rather than one." Kylo looked hurt. "You..don't care about me?" "Oh, no, no. I do, very much so, believe me, darling. I'll show you later. But for now, I need to focus on the best interest of my galaxy. Not on my whiny, but beautiful husband." "Alright, my love." Kylo shook his head, a smile spreading across his lips. He took Hux's hands and kissed the ginger's forehead. "Now, go kill that negotiation." Hux kissed Kylo's full lips. "I shall."
