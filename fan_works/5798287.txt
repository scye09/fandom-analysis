Kylo groaned as his head pounded, watching the roof of the ambulance spinning. Trust Hux to cause him to fall down the stairs – no, no, trust Hux to push him down the stairs. “I think he has a concussion.” “I wish I had a fucking concussion.” Kylo heard the sigh Hux made before he turned to watch the older man try and climb into the ambulance. Kylo moved his foot so that the it connected with Hux’s face. “No! No, family only, right?” He looked up at the paramedic who nodded. “Right.” “Oh sorry, family only, you’re not my fucking family.” “I’m not your family but you still call me daddy.” "That's disgusting, you're flirting with me and I have a serious concussion, don't let him in here, he's a monster.” The ambulance door shut and Kylo listened to Hux yelling his name as the ambulance started driving off. “Makes a change; hearing him yell my name.” Notes: Inspired by this scene from Girls that (as you can see on the post) my friend told me to imagine as Kylux and I stupidly did. Trash. I am trash. Plus I need to watch Girls and this is kind me getting off my ass to do that. I am trash. Thank you for your time. Keep it real.
