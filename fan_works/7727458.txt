waking up in the same bed together for twit user canignitestars. (See the end of the work for more notes .) Chapter 1 It’s barely lit when Kylo wakes, nothing but a soft, natural light illuminating the room. His forehead is pressed to Hux’s bare back, warm breath ghosting across the skin. It’s nice to be intertwined with the General, his arms wrapped tight around Hux’s waist, one leg pushed between the others. He doesn’t want to move. Neither, it seems, does Hux. When the other man wakes, he doesn’t tell him to leave like he usually does. Rather, he turns in Kylo’s arms and buries his face in the crook of Kylo’s neck, content to simply lie there and relax for once. Chapter 2 Summary: For Roy, who gave me the line "I told you to be careful, Ren." Somehow, they make it off the planet alive. Kylo still clings to him as they fly away, his bloodied body hanging from Hux’s shoulder. Normally, Hux would've pushed him off by now, but he was injured rather badly, and the warmth of Kylo’s body against his eases the panic he'd felt when he'd spotted Kylo in the snow, the panic he's already beginning to deny. Staring at the blood dripping down Kylo’s face, he calls for medical care before murmuring “I told you to be careful, Ren.” His only response is a soft smile, one Hux wants to punch away.
