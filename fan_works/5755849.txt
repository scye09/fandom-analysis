Chapter 3: The Beginning Kylo and bree train everyday for 8 hours. She's becoming stronger but not strong enough. Kylo kicked her to the other side of the training room. Get up he shouted. She tried but she just collapsed back onto the mat. She laid there panting. He slowly walked toward her and picked her up. He sat her in his lap and stroked her hair. It's ok bree. We'll take a break. You've been doing really well. Bree nodded against his chest. That's when she realized she was in his lap. Her face became as red as a stop light. And he looked down at her. He lifted her face with his finger and said why are you so red baby girl? Are you hot or are you being shy again? She couldn't speak so she told him both with her mind. He leaned down and gave her a soft but passionate kiss. I told there's no reason to by shy around daddy. That's when he kissed her again with a little more force. Bree kissed back and he slid his tongue in her mouth. She then straddled him and they were both breathing hard. Daddy wants to hear you scream his name. Are you ready? I was born ready daddy.
