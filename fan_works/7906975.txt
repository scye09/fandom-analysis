After Han's death, the ghost of Leia's father appeared to her in a halo of blue light. She'd been in the middle of examining her brother's old lightsaber when he materialized, young and scarred, with a peculiar gleam in his eye. She quickly put the weapon down. "Why are you here?" He examined her with a barely disguised hunger. "To remind you of who you are." Leia stiffened and locked the saber away, trembling. "I know who I am." "Do you?" There was Vader in his voice and in spite of the locks, the saber flew into her hand anyway.
