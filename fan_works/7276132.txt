Phasma kissed Gil, who had leapt up to help Phasma remove her armour, and laughed at Unamo's shocked expression. "Oh come on, you are curious, aren't you? Why else would you have come back?"

Phasma rubbed hands through her cropped hair and stretched. "Gil says you are a respectful domme. She said she needs... likes to be taken out of her head occasionally. I don't want to do that for her." "Oh!" Unamo wrestled with the idea of her desires being not just tolerated as a secret, but encouraged.
