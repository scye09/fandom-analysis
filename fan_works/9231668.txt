For a split second, a dull pain sits in her chest. It’s empty, hollow and heart stopping. Almost to the point of hurting- it teeters on the edge, pulsing to the beat of a dirge not yet written. This pain pushes at the inside of her chest, daring to break through age-worn skin. Then there is nothing. He’s always felt an ocean away, but suddenly she can't feel him at all. The pain fades away to a numbness, lingering in her bones like cancer. He was there, once, but now he is gone.
