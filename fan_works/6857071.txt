F: "Poe! Rey!" P: "What, Finn?" F: "I was thinking about..." R: "It's late, Finn..." P: "This is the point, Rey, didn't you get it? It's 3 in the morning, this is the time when you're the most creative..." R: "Oh, OK, I get it now. Go on, Finn, we listen." F: "We're made of star dust, right?" P: "I...guess..." F: "This is what we are told every time, right? That we're made of star dust. This means we're stars. We're all stars!" Poe and Rey sighed at the same time. R: "This is beautiful, actually..." P: "Hold up. This means even our neighbour Ben is a star?" R: "Oh my God, you ruined it, Poe..." F: "He's a black hole. A big, nasty, black hole..." Looked like Finn talked too loud, because someone from the upper flat knocked in their ceiling. P: "Oh, for real now..." R: "And when he fights with his roommates and we can hear him clearly we're 'overly sensitive'" F: "Next time he does that, we reclaim him, OK?" P: "Good." R: "Now, guys, enough with the philosophy and let's go to bed." F & P: "Good night, Rey!" R: "Good night!" Chapter 2 "Pssst! Eric!" The blonde turned around, facing Grelle, who was looking at him with wide eyes: "Red, ain't it late? Shouldn't ye be sleepin'?" "I was thinking." She made herself comfortable and continued. "Where are we from?" "Um...Earth?" "Maybe. But we're told - or at least I was told - that people are star dust. Does it mean that reapers are also star dust?" "I dunno, Red..." "But hold up a minute! Maybe we're star dust from dead stars! Like...hey, what was that for?!" It didn't hurt - the pillow was soft and fluffy - but Grelle pretended to be mad, dropping the act when she felt Eric's arm wrapping around her shoulder and pulling her close again: "It became complicated, Red. An' we're both too tired to discuss life problems at these wee hours." "OK, OK, I'm going to sleep." She closed her eyes, smiling unconsciously when she felt his chin on her head. "Goodnight, Eric!" "'Night, Red..." Chapter 3 "Levi!" "What now, shitty glasses?" "What if all titans are shifters, like Eren? Do they unconsciously shift and when they get back to human form they remember nothing?" "Do you mean that, regarding this theory, I might be a titan shifter who doesn't remember anything?" "Yeah, exactly! Even you could be a titan shifter, even I can be a titan shifter..." "Hanji, there's this thing called "getting drunk" which is approximately the same as being a titan shifter, only that you don't physically become a titan." "Oh come on, midget...HEY!" Levi didn't intend to break the pillow in Hanji's head ( Too much to clean after ), so his hit had been unusually soft. Not enough for Hanji, who turned around, facing away from Levi. Only when he wrapped an arm around her did she drop the mad act. "Y'know, slob, you have good ideas at night. You should put 'em down." "I will. Good night, midget!" "Good night, shitty glasses!"
