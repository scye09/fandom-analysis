"On Tatooine, there are two suns," Luke (Luke, Luke, always and forever Luke; never Master or any title more intimate) says wistfully. Rey feels a bubble of resentment - not the first- coil up in her middle; of course Luke would have grown up somewhere where, despite a desert as harsh as Jakku's, even a sun didn't have to be alone. He startles her then: he turns and meets her eyes, half-smile about his lips: "That doesn't mean they don't both set, Rey."
