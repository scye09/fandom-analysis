Ben lets Han take the lightsaber from his hands. He tosses it off the catwalk into the depths below. “I’m so sorry, dad” Ben breaks down into tears. “I’m so sorry.” They pull each other into a hug and bury their faces into each others shoulders. Han hushes him. “It’s okay,” He says. “Han!” Rey shouts. “Stormtroopers!” Finn warns. *Star Wars Theme Music* Chewbacca let’s out a triumphant howl as the three of them cover Han and Ben from the balcony. “Time to go home,” Han says to Ben. He pulls out his blaster gun, and leads them all to their great escape. Notes: Don't worry I haven't forgotten about writing those Teen Wolf fics! I'm still working on all of them.
