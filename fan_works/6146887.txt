“Some nice flying there,” Poe calls out, jumping down from Black One with careless ease. “Not too shabby yourself, commander,” Jess retorts, climbing from her x-wing and ignoring the hand he holds out to her. Poe’s dark eyes study Jess’ flushed face with wordless approval, lingering on her pale skin. It’s a dramatic contrast to her glossy black hair that she keeps tied back in a loose ponytail. Attraction has always been there between them. It’s unspoken but tantalising. Chain of command precludes either from ever acting upon it. Poe grins broadly. He’s never been one for following the rules.
