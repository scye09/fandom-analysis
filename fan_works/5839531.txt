Kail Bothnati It is cold, loud, and the light from Krev’s welding was sending pain signals throbbing through my skull. “Augh,” I moaned as I rolled over in my bedroll, on the floor beneath my workbench. The sound of metal clattering to the floor was the final straw. Sitting up I looked at my watch, Great, two hours of sleep. It’s not like I need more. Unzipping my bedding I crawled out and stretched up towards the ceiling. I let my arms fall and ran them through my short brown hair, before pulling on a hat. Long hair and engines, oil, and grime do not mix well. Cracking my neck I walked over to my latest project and stroked the interface with my index finger. A JR-4 Bespin swoop, the best you could ask for, and Sab had gone and blown out its beautiful engine. Turning around I grabbed my tool kit and got to work shaking my head, For a guy who can shoot a wombat from 200 meters, Sab Bathtec is the most stupid, ignorant, moof milking---.” “Bothnaaaaaati!” A voice yelled, and the feeling of slime sliding down my back made me bristle. “Hey, Sab,” I said wiping my hands off on a rag, black grease smeared over my fingertips, hiding the pale skin beneath the drudge. The Duros stalked down the stairs towards me, his blue brow wrinkled. And bad mood of the day crops up, before I’ve had a chance to have breakfast. “I wanted this bike fixed yesterday,” he said glaring at me. I took a deep breath, “Well, since I didn’t get it until last night--- ack!” His four digit hand caught me around the throat and pushed me up against the bike. His long index finger slid over my lips and I turned away, “Don’t forget who you’re speaking to, brat. You’d be dead if I hadn’t bought you from that Dug. I can still sell you to McKade down the street, if you continue to displease me. He’s looking for a new whore,” he spat in my face. I looked down shrinking against the cool metal of the bike behind me, “You’ll have it in two days.” “I want it tomorrow.” With one last shove, he released me and walked up the stairway, slamming the door of my confinement. My hands shook as I turned and started working on the engine. I glanced across the room to see Krev peering over his twin engine speeder bike. “What are you looking at?” I hissed. The Rodian spat back at me but ducked behind his engine when I raised my fist and the multiphase wrench I had gripped in my palm. Wiping my face I got back to work, This piece of shit isn’t going to fix itself. ****************************************************************************** Ben Solo “Ben, I’m only here to keep you from getting yourself killed. All the legwork belongs to you,” Keon said as he sat down at the bar. He glanced behind him, his platinum blonde braid falling over his shoulder, as he peered up at me, “Keep me updated, be careful, and you’ll do fine.” His light purple colored eyes glowing in the strobe lights. “Yes, master.” I turned around and surveyed the bar, gazing through the smoke and the crowds of patrons dancing to the heavy beat of some nonsense song. Taking a deep breath, I moved through the crowd, pushing my way forward, when a hot, clawed hand grabbed my arm. I turned around only to be met by fiery red eyes. Zabrak. I look over her face, up to the sharp horns sticking up from her scalp and the long black braids of hair the spilled over her shoulders, coming to rest on her breasts. Her plump black lips parted to reveal white fangs. I raised an eyebrow and she pulled me closer grinding against me. With a growl she stepped back, one claw hooked around my belt. Her hips swayed as she pulled me deeper into the crowd. I throw one last look over my shoulder catching Keon’s eye. He smirked and held up his glass of lightening blue liquor. I shook my head as I looked back to the woman guiding me onto the dance floor, Bastard. ****************************************************************************** Kail Bothnati “Come on baby, save momma’s bony ass,” I whispered as I fired up the engines. A purring sound, like a Wookie dozing beneath a heat lamp, fell on my ears and I let out a sigh of relief as I turned it off again. “Thank you,” I said patting the port oscillator as I hopped off. Stepping over to my workbench I pulled out a bottle of water and uncapped the lid, as I leaned against the counter. With a tired smirk I tilted the bottle towards the bike in salute, “To me,” I laughed as I took a swig of the lukewarm liquid. Wiping my mouth I stored the bottle and walked around the bike, polishing here and there. The better it looks, the less pissed off Sab will be , I told myself. As I bent down to wipe at an oil smudge on the footrest I heard familiar footsteps stomping down the stairs. Speak of the Devil. Sab and one of his call girls walked over to my station. He grunted and I stepped out of the way so he could inspect his bike, “The motor’s fixed, and I shaved down the fuel intake. Same speed less cost,” I told him. The Twi’Lek behind him looked me up and down with bloodshot eyes, Definitely a spice girl. I wiped my forehead as Sab turned around, “Have Krev bring it to the race up on the mid-level tomorrow.” I stepped behind him, “I can bring it,” I said trying to hide the desperation in my voice. Sab ran his hand down the side of the Twi’Lek’s body groping at her flesh, “That’s what you said last time. You almost made off with my second best bike, and credit stash.” I ran up the steps behind him, “I’ve been stuck in here for three months. Please you gotta let me out.” The Twi’Lek tilted her head back, and laughed, “ Please, Sab,” she said in a nasal tone, mimicking me. I glared at her and she held tighter to the Duros, “I’ll do anything, I’ll wear a tracker whatever you want. Just let me out.” He shook his head and walked out the door, “I’ll think about it.” ****************************************************************************** Ben Solo We stood in the alley, the dull beat of the club still loud enough to be heard from outside. The Zabrak leaned forward trying to kiss me, but I pushed her against a wall. Not enough to hurt her, but enough to get her attention. She let out a gasp and looked up at me, showing me her fangs. Her pointed teeth raked over her lips and she murmured seductively, “Uba wamma fofo whao uba bacaka fa phibee.” Great, more Huttese. Working quickly, I translated what little I understood. It was something about paying double? Frowning I put both hands on either side of her face and focused on her mind. The scent of spice and other drugs emanated from her and I could tell this will be almost too easy. If I could get her to stop trying to touch me… “I’m looking for someone,” I breathed as I looked down at her. Hot hands moved across my stomach, lifting up the hem of my tunic, and I closed my eyes, keeping my calm. With calculated power, I pushed her hands away. A small gasp escaped her as she looked at my hands that were still next to her face. “Uba doth wa Jeedai,” she spat accusingly. Growing impatient I pushed against the mental wall separating our minds, instantly quelling any questions or objects she might have had. “I’m looking for a Duros. Sab Bathtec. He has something of mine. You will tell me where he is.” The woman’s eyes clouded over and her posture straightened in a familiar fashion. You can always tell someone is under a mind trick, by their eyes, and the way their body relaxes unnaturally. She looked straight through me, “I’s will tell you where’s is he,” she slurred in broken Basic. She was silent for a moment and I stepped back. “Well?” I prompted. “Lower-city hideout. Nobata outsiders.” I waved my fingers, “Where does he go when he’s not there?” “Swoop races.” “And the next one is…?” “Tomorrow, noon, mid-level.” I turned and spoke into my communication device, “Keon, I’ve got the son of a bitch.” Chapter 2 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Kail Bothnati “Naa bimhee, brat ,” Krev’s voice murmured as a hard foot kicked me awake. I shot up, banging my head against the underside of the workbench. “Damnit,” I hissed holding my head as I climbed out, “What do you want?” I spat. The Rodian held out a bag, and I opened it, scanning the contents. I pulled out a bracelet with sharp teeth-like pincers, narrowing my eyes, “He’s letting me go?” Krev held up his hands and started tinkering with his speeder. With a deep breath I slid the bracelet over my wrist, and bit back a scream as it embedded itself in my arm. Pursing my lips, I breathed out, as the pain ebbed to a dull ache, and looked at my skin, reddening around the hellish bracelet. The only way to get it off now, would be to have Sab’s code, or a really good hacker. I looked back inside the bag, my eyes going wide. “He can’t be serious,” I said pulling the outfit from the bag. It was obvious that this was Sab’s way of reminding me how close I was to being a whore. If the number of leather straps and buckles were anything to go by. Krev pulled his goggles away from his eyes and yelled over at me, “Uba sey, “I’ll wear anything.”” With an inward groan I started pulling off my clothes, It won’t be that bad, will it? ***************************************************************************** Ben Solo The swoop track was festering with low-life’s and thugs, gathering around to bet on the race. Pulling up my hood I walked through the crowd, keeping my eyes low, my figure unassuming. Bikes sped past on the track and a bell sounded as the announcer’s voice came over the loud speakers, “Aaaaaand, it looks like Bothan Nowari is today’s leader once again.” I looked up at the board as the names for the next two races flitted over the huge screen. Turning around I started down the walkway, when a body slammed into me. I stumbled back as a small, thin, body dressed in a black leather outfit fell to the ground with a yell. Fiery eyes burned up at me from a girl with short brown hair and alabaster skin, “Asshole! Watch where you’re going!” From the volume of her voice saw and felt the number of eyes that looked our way. Without a word I turned and pushed my way through the crowd, and all but disappeared. ***************************************************************************** Kail Bothnati “Hey!” I yelled as the boy vanished. “Race 3 begins in fifteen minutes.” And I’m late. Sab’s gonna kill me. With a groan I picked myself up, and started pushing Sab’s bike up the ramp. When I reached the top the Duros scowled at me. “Where have you been?” he growled. Being the smartass I am, I naturally gestured to my outfit, “It’s hard to run when you’re wearing a corset and leather shackles.” Sab raised his hand to slap me, and try as I might, I couldn’t help but flinch. He lowered his hand, and nodded to the track, “Just hurry up. I’m not losing because of some street brat.” Without another word I pushed the bike forward, putting it in its racing slot. Jumping up on the seat I input the engine code, and hopped off as it fired up. ****************************************************************************** Ben Solo Keon and I leaned against the bar, separating us from the racing track and mechanic’s pit. Impatient I shifted from one foot to the other as the Duros stood right in front of us. I turned to Keon and hissed, “We should take him now, before his bike gets here.” My master held up his hand, “Be patient,” he murmured as he pointed to two Gands with heavy blasters standing just a few meters behind their mark. “If we wait until the last second we can nab Sab without having to deal with them.” Biting back my protest I looked over the swoop track. Sab Bathtec paced back and forth erradically, the dark shade of blue creeping over his cranium a sign of distress. I glanced at the race clock. Ten minutes to the race and no bike? I’d be stressed too. The Duros looked up and stalked towards the ramp as a bike was pushed up onto the pit by a small girl. Her toned body twisted in some getup that probably came from a brothel. Black leather straps wrapped around her chest, tightly, pressing against her breasts. Her bare, flat stomach moved with each breath as she pushed the bike along, then the leather straps wrapped tightly around her hips, giving curves to what would normally be straight and narrow. My fist assumption was that she was just another spice whore, but her body was too steady, her movements too focused to be an addict. Her hand ran through her short hair, and a slave bracelet gleamed in the artificial lights overhead. It wasn’t until she glanced over at the crowd that I recognized her. “Asshole! Watch where you’re going!” Gritting my teeth I turned my head avoiding her gaze. Keon hit me on the shoulder and pointed. Slowly I glanced over to see the girl pushing her bike over to Sab’s racing slot. The Duros stopped her, and the girl glared up at him, her lips moving quickly. Whatever she said, the alien did not appreciated it, and he held his hand up. I felt my body lurch forward, and then a hand press against the center of my chest. I looked up and to my left, as Keon shook his head, “Wait,” he mouthed. Narrowing my eyes I looked back to see the blue male dropping his hand, as the girl flinched. She walked past him, and pushed the bike forward. The two Gands behind them stepped away, and Keon reached into his robe, with a nod. Pulling back my hood, I flexed my hands, ready for a fight. ****************************************************************************** Kail Bothnati Once the bike was in place I turned around as Sab waved off his Gand bodyguards. I glanced at the crowd behind him and crossed my arms, feeling overly exposed. “You’ll wait with those two,” Sab said, then pointed a finger at my arm, “You better be there when I get back, or I’ll blow you to hell and back.” I gave a stiff nod and started to walk past him. VNNNNNNN. Two blades of blue and yellow glowed, as Sab’s bodyguards flew in opposite directions. Two men, one with a long blonde braid and the other with shaggy, midnight black hair, stalked towards me. I instantly recognized him. The boy that knocked me down. He’s a Jedi? I thought as I took a step back. Panic set in as he stared at me. The elder of the two looked past me with bright, almost purple eyes. “Sab Bathtec, you are charged with---.” A hard forearm wrapped around my neck, as Sab dragged me back, “You have no jurisdiction here, Jedi Scum!” he yelled, then he pressed a blaster to my head. I gripped his arm, and struggled as he pressed against my windpipe. The Jedi looked at each other. The boy nodded to me, “Let the girl go, and we can work this out.” His voice was level and deeper than I figured it would be. “I don’t think so.” He reached down and grabbed my wrist showing them the bracelet. “You see this? If she gets farther than two kilometers from me, or I send a signal through mine, she goes boom-boom.” Sab laughed, as his thugs filled the stands behind the Jedi. He stared at the two men as the gang members took aim. With a shallow breath I grabbed Sab’s arm, “Look out!” I yelled then I bit down. Sab shrieked and pushed me away. As I stumbled forward I turned around, and faced him as he aimed his gun at me. I raised an arm as he pulled the trigger. But the shot never came. I looked up as Sab stared at me, a red bolt glowing and hanging in the air between us. What the---? “I would move if I were you!” I looked behind me and crossed eyes with the younger Jedi. His black hair was tousled in the wind, as he held a hand out towards me, keeping the bolt in place. His friend stood behind him blocking shots from Sab’s gang. Brown eyes stared and yelled at me, “Now.” I rolled to the side and moved away, as the Jedi released his hold and the blaster bolt met the ground in a mini explosion of sparks and smoke. Brown eyes cursed as Sab hopped on his bike and sped down the track. “Damnit Keon, he got away,” he yelled as he joined his friend and sent a bolt flying back at its shooter. Beep. I crouched down to the ground breathing heavily. The bracelet on my arm began to beep and glow the farther Sab got away. No, please, I don’t want to die! I looked up as the thugs ran from the stadium, the Jedi too much to handle. “Help,” I whispered, the two men didn’t hear me. “Ben, calm down, we’ll get him next time,” the man named Keon said as he deactivated his saber. The younger of the two spun on his heel, “We could have had him if---.” “HELP ME, PLEASE!” I yelled at the top of my lungs. They both turned and looked at me, before Keon took off in my direction. His eyes were wide as he stared down at my arm. “Okay calm down. I can fix this.” He grabbed my arm and stared at it. “You don’t have the code,” the younger man said. I sobbed, “I don’t want to die, p-please--.” The braclet began to beep faster and I sobbed harder. Keon stood up. “I can’t get it off---.” “Then what do we do?” “Hold onto her.” Brown eyes crouched down and reached out for me. I flinched and his eyes softened, “Trust me,” he said. He pressed a hand on my shoulder as Keon took ahold of my arm. “What is he---?” VNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN. Notes: Comments and Kudos are always appreciated!!! Chapter 3 Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Kail Bothnati I was floating in darkness, numb, and blind. Then a light shone, then another, and another, like the lights of the cosmos, peering down at me. My lungs filled with air, and slowly, feeling returned to my body. A dull ache was present at the tips of my finger, Why does my hand hurt? I tried to move it and the pain radiate up my arm, coming to a stop at my elbow. I tried to move it, Why isn’t it working? Panic settled in my gut and I breathed in quick gasps. “You need to calm down,” a voice said in the darkness. With every syllable the stars glowed brighter, wiping away the void. “Ben, give her another stim pack.” Something stuck me in the side, and my heart began to pound as my sight came back to me. With a gasp I sat up, scrambling back in the bed I was laying in. I was in a dark room, no windows, just a bed and a light flickering overhead, “Where am I?” A man sat down in front of me with purple eyes. He held out his hand, “You’re safe now, but you need to calm down.” I looked across the room at a boy staring at me from the corner. I turned back to the man beside me. Purple eyes stared at me, What was his name? I thought, remembering his face, Keon? The older man looked at me, “What’s your nam---?” I let out a groan of pain as fire shot through my arm, and I looked down. My stomach churned and I began to scream. White bandages wrapped around my elbow, and where my forearm and hand should have been was just empty space. It’s gone?! Throwing back the covers I kicked Keon in the side and fell off the bed. “What did you do to me?!” I screamed as I scrambled across the cold stone floor. Hugging myself I pushed my back into a corner and sobbed as the two men moved towards me slowly. Keon knelt down on one knee, “I am so sorry, it was the only way to save you. I would never have done that if I had any other choice.” He looked at me as though he was the one in horrible pain. “We can fix it. Trust me, I---.” “Trust you? You cut off my, ARM!” I yelled. Hyperventilating, I glanced at my arm, or what had once been my arm, I can feel it, it’s like it’s still there… I leaned forward on my knees as I went dizzy, the pain enveloping my entire consciousness. I leaned against the wall and cover my mouth with my one remaining hand. “I’m going to be sick.” ******************************************************************* Ben Solo The girl from the race track was kneeling on the floor staring up at us in terror. Considering her predicament? I didn’t blame her. Keon murmured something to her, telling her how sorry he was. I could tell he meant it. He never apologized to anyone. Ever. “I’m going to be sick,” the girl said. I looked back at her, at her face. She covered her mouth with her left hand and gagged, as her skin turned a pale green. Acting fast I grabbed a waste basket and handed it to her. She glanced at me before hanging her head over the rim and emptying her stomach. Keon stood up and reached into his pack on the other side of the bed. Turning around he uncapped a syringe filled with pain meds. I bit back the need to remind him how little we had left and that we would need them. One look at the girl, with her body trembling and her eyes squeezed shut with pain told me she needed the meds more than we did. The girl flinched as Keon took a step towards her, pale eyes focusing on the syringe in his hand. “It will help with the pain,” he said. The girl shook her head, and press herself against the wall. “Don’t touch me,” she spat. Keon crouched down and held his hand out to her inching closer, “I just want to help.” “Don’t. Touch. Me.” The second those word left her lips the light that had been flickering all night finally went out. I peered into the darkness, but saw nothing. The sound of something thudding to the ground grabbed my attention, and I reached out in the force. Keon sighed when he felt it. “I got her, she’s out. Ben, can you find the lamp in my bag?” he asked. Silently I reached out for the bed, feeling my way through the darkness. There it is. I switched the light on and set it on the table. Turning around I watched as Keon picked the girl up. “I’ll put her in the chair, while we get the bed cleaned up,” he said. I looked down at the sheets covered in blood from cleaning her wound. “What are we going to do with her, Master?” I asked as I began pulling the sheets off the bed. Keon was quiet and I turned around. He was standing next to the chair staring at the girl, a grim expression ghosting over his face. “Master?” I asked. His shoulders went slack and he pivoted on one foot, “We need to return to the academy,” he said. I dropped the ball of sheets and stared at him, “But the mission--- I still haven’t met the requirements to be---.” Keon held a hand out to me, “There will be more missions, Ben. As to your training, I’ll talk with Luke. I think you’ve adequately proven you have what it takes to join the Knights.” I stared at him in surprise, speechless. Keon turned around again and looked down at the chair thinking. I stepped over and stared down at the girl, “You’re bringing her with us? She isn’t Force-sensitive---.” “I’m not leaving her here. Not after what we did to her.” “Luke won’t like this,” I said shaking my head. Keon glanced over at me, “Let me handle Luke. You just get us ready to leave.” ****************************************************************************** Kail Bothnati My eyelids opened and closed, sluggishly like time was slowed. Unfamiliar faces stared down at me, “She’s waking up,” a woman said. I closed my eyes feeling as though I was floating in a pool of water. Something brushed against me and I flinched, “Good reactions considering the anesthesia. Sit her up.” Soft hands hoisted me up by the shoulders. My head lolled forward, and I could feel my body swaying from left to right. Everything was so slow. Where am I? A black, gloved hand snapped in front of me, and I looked up. A man with red hair peered down at me, with a half-smile. I swallowed as he pulled up a stool and sat down in front of me. His lips moved and his voice sounded low and distorted, “Do you know where you are?” I shook my head, and I felt something pop inside my head. Sounds began to clear and the world moved faster. I looked around the sterile white room. “What’s your name?” the man asked. I looked in front of me as he glanced at me expectantly. “Kail Bothnati,” I breathed. The man typed my words into his computer. “How old are you?” “Sixteen.” I narrowed my eyes and asked a question of my own, “What is this place?” “It’s an academy… for people with certain aptitudes. Master Samari brought you here to take care of your arm.” I cock my head and he nods his head and reached for me. I gasped as I looked down. “How did you--- they cut it off,” I whispered as tears began to build up. The man took my hand in his and my breath hitched as a sense of feeling came from the appendage, “We have a state of the art medical facility here. An arm is pretty… normal.” I lifted the hand up hesitatingly, wiling it to close into a fist. Which it did. Flexing my new hand I laughed as tears poured down my face. The man stood up, “Someone will be by to speak with you soon.” The man left the room, but I didn’t care. I was too busy crying over my new hand to worry about anything else. ****************************************************************************** Ben Solo “You can’t just bring every tramp, and orphan you find in here Keon,” Luke said with a frown. “She isn’t a tramp… maybe an orphan, but come on we’re supposed to help orphans,” Master Keon joked. Luke glowered and I took a step away from the wall, “Uncle, we couldn’t just leave her. She needed help.” “This is a sanctuary for Force-sensitives. The more people we bring here the bigger chance we have of being discovered.” Keon cocked his head, “We haven’t been attacked for two years Luke, and one girl isn’t going to ruin that record.” Keon set a hand on Luke’s shoulder, “You know me, I wouldn’t have brought her if it wasn’t absolutely necessary.” Luke sighed, and moved across the room, to the observation window. Looking out of it he surveyed the gaseous planet we were orbiting, “The doctors will have her fixed up soon. Then she needs to leave as soon as she is able.” “And where will she go? Luke, your being unreasonable. Talk to her, maybe she can stay on as a staff member.” “A staff member?” Luke asked turning around and raising an eyebrow, “And what exactly would that job description entail?” I cleared my throat, “Mechanics?” The two masters looked at me and I explained, “I got a look at her hands before, they were covered in grime, and calluses.” I glanced at Keon, “And you saw the way she had the bike set up in under two minutes. I don’t think she was one of Sab’s girls as much as she was his mechanic.” Luke glanced between Keon and I, then he changed the subject, “I understand Sab Bathtec was allowed to escape?” Keon glanced at me, “Ben would you mind waiting outside. I bowed to the both of them and left the room as Keon explained, “In the chaos with the girl and the rest of Sab’s gang, the target did escape…” **************************************************************************** Kail Bothnati I let my hand fall to my lap, the weight of it reassuring me that is was real. With a sigh I glanced around the room, and wiggled in the course, black fiber dressing gown they had given me. Standing up, I stuck my head out the doorway, and looked up and down the hall. There was no sign of movement. Crossing my arms over my chest I stepped over the threshold and walked down the hall, the sound of voices drawing my attention. With a gasp I stopped by one of the windows and looked outside. A huge red planet was below us and I realized we were in space. My heart raced, I’ve never been off planet before . As I looked down at the planet a sense of worry settled over me. **************************************************************************** Ben Solo I leaned against a wall, waiting for either Keon or Luke to exit the conference room. I was growing impatient, What’s taking so long? A group of younglings walked by and I turned towards the window. “Hey, Ben!” With an inward groan I turned around. Manze, an apprentice a year behind my class walked over to me. Her overly cheery smile made me wish Luke and Keon would talk faster. “I heard you were back. How did the mission go?” “Fine.” “Someone said you and Master Samari brought back some girl---.” “Look, do you mind?” I spat at her. Manze jerked back and I looked behind her to see Keon smirking at us. I stepped past her and walked over to him. “Ben, how many times have I told you? You have to be nice to the ladies.” I glared at him then looked back over at the girl who was staring at us speechless. Keon waved his hand, “Hi, Manze.” Shaking her head, the girl took off down the hall. The man next to me sighed, “Ben, we need to work on your wooing skills.” Notes: Comments make me a better writer, and they're like Christmas presents!!!
