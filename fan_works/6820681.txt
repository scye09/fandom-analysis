Finn reached out and adjusted the black material, running his fingers over the soft cloth. “You okay?” he asked Poe smiled smiled and nuzzled into the palm of Finn’s hand. He kissed the tips of his fingers, ending it with a cheeky kiss. “I’m okay,” he promised, “you?” Finn considered the question. The two sat naked on their shared bed, Poe blindfolded and Finn not.
