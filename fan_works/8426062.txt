Hux does not shriek. He has not shrieked in - he does not shriek. He did not expect the sudden shock of violence at the back of his head, nor did he expect the horror and dishonour of the dribbles and shards working coldly down his nape. He absolutely did not expect it , and as such has no idea what the proportionate response to this is. He is an adult. Mature. A General . And the only person anywhere nearby who would have the gall to throw weaponised ground-water at him is busily trying to not shake in amusement, wrapped up in the millions of layers of black he wears. Hux narrows his eyes, and continues on. *** Kylo is in the shower. He is busily cleaning himself after a long day (Hux had declined to join him for once), humming nonsense tunes to himself. Hux waits until Kylo’s almost ready to leave, then he strikes. He pulls open the door to the fresher, and up-ends the bucket of melting snow-drift onto the man’s head. “HUX WHAT THE FUCK?” “I was just returning your volley,” he replies, trying not to be too smug about it as he watches his Knight sputtering under the cold spray. “IT WAS ONE SNOWBALL.” “Yes, and now I’ve preemptively prevented you from escalating the situation.” “I’M NOT THE FUCKING REPUBLIC.” “No. You’re not. I wish we could end them by dumping snow on them.” He hands Kylo a towel. Kylo grabs it. “We have stew for dinner,” he says, by way of a truce. (He hopes it’s ended the hostilities. He’ll soon find out.) Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 54 of the Kylux - Fluff & Angst series Next Work →
