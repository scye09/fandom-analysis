She woke, and he was holding her hand, waiting. And he did not tease her, or speak at all, just kept holding her hand, unable, or not ready, to say anything (for a change). The room was faded, distant, full of far-away beeping, and ghostly, half-there people moving soberly around her bed, but she knew he was the only one who was there , who could see she was now awake. She looked over and smiled at him. He wore a strange expression, half a smile, but somehow very sad. His smile flickered a little brighter as she met his eyes, and then morphed into a familiar casually-mocking-yet-affectionate smirk. His voice was that same drawl she had simultaneously wanted and not wanted to hear for the last year or so. 'Good morning, Highness.' Notes: Thank you for reading. Pontius
