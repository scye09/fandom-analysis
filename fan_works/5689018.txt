He was feeling depressed when his best friend moved out of the state, and he wanted them back. Hux knew he was going to see Poe again, but he didn't know when. He wanted to hold them, and tell them he loved their relationship with each other. "I miss them so much. So, so much." he cried, but then he heard a fake cough coming from the back of him. "Hux, why are you crying, and moping around?" Poe's voice filled the room, and Hux jumped up. He wanted to run over and hug Poe tightly, but nobody was with him in the room. That's strange, he said to himself, as he sat on his bed. "Poe? Are you there?" he called out, hoping that he wasn't hearing things. "I'm here with you in spirit. I'll always be here for you, love." Poe said, and Hux smiled. It was good to know Poe was always going to be there for him.
