“Can we pretend that it’s real?” Matt looked up at the hopeful sound of Techie’s voice. He raised an eyebrow, glancing at the small white substance the other was talking about. He licked the tip of his finger before pressing it lightly into the substance, tasting it on the tip of his tongue. He blinked at the sweetness, looking at it curiously. “Synth-Sugar?” he asked. Techie nodded his head. “Where did you get it from?” Matt asked with a faint frown. Techie blushed and looked down at the ground, wringing his hands. “I found a seller...just a kid. Kids don’t cut it with fake stuff. They don’t know how to do that yet.” “You know you have to be careful when you go out to buy such things. If a Judge caught you...” “I know.” “I’m just saying. I don’t want anything bad to happen to you,” he murmured. “I don’t think you’d last a day in a Cube; let alone the years you’d get for buying Synth-Sugar from a dealer.” “I’m careful.” Matt looked him over, smiling sadly as he nodded and pulled him into his arms. “I know you are,” he said, “I just want to make sure you stay safe,” he said. Techie smiled and nuzzled into his cheek, kissing him. “Thank you, Matt.”
