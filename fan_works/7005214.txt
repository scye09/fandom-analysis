“I'm sorry, Sir.” The apology surprises Hux. He blinks and looks at the blushing Mitaka, shaking his head as he reached out to take his hand into his own, pulling him up onto his feet. “What are you apologizing for?” he asks. “I couldn't...my throat is too...” Understanding dawns on him. He smiles at him kindly, shaking his head as he pulls Mitaka into his lap. “Mitaka, there is nothing to apologize for. Your throat is not capable of allowing you to give oral. Then we shall simply make sure you never attempt it.” “But, Sir...” Hux kisses him to make him go silent, humming as he gently runs a hand down Mitaka's bare chest. “I am sure we can find other ways to make each other feel good, hm?” Mitaka blushes but smiles, nodding his head. “Yes, Sir.” “Good boy.”
