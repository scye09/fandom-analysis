It was a close race. Kylo was pulling ahead, aaand Hux had white knuckles on his controller. Then, Kylo crossed the finsih line, cheering. Hux, needless to say, was angry. He slammed his controller on the cushion next to him, scaring Millicent away. "You're sleeping on the couch," Hux said curtly. Kylo laughed, confused. He turned off the Wii, then the TV. "I beat you at Mario Kart, and now you're banishing me to the couch for one night?" Hux wouldn't look Kylo in the eye. He was still fuming over how he lost a game meant for children. Just another thing Kylo could tease him about. Kylo deserved to sleep on the couch. "Yes, Kylo." "Will you be able to last the night without me, lover?" Kylo purred, pressing a soft kiss to Hux's neck. Hux shoved his boyfriend's head away. "Ugh. Of course I will. You're absolutely awful at night anyways." "I am not ," Kylo said, closing in on Hux again. He had a predatory smile on his face. "I think you enjoy me." "Not when you beat me at Mario Kart and gloat about it." Kylo threw his arms up in exasperation. "Hux! I'm unnaturally good at Rainbow Road, okay?! Get over it!" Hux chuckled. He lifted Kylo's chin with his index finger. "You're unnaturally good at numerous things." Kylo rolled his eyes, a little laugh escaping his full lips. He took Hux into his arms. "I knew you'd say something like that. See? Mario Kart is good for our relationship." Hux kissed Kylo. "Fine. But next time, we're playing Luigi Circuit."
