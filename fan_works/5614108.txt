The klaxons blare just as Poe climaxes, rutting out his orgasm against Finn's hip. "Shit." He groans, dropping his forehead to Finn's shoulder, mouthing at the skin there. "C'mon." Finn laughs. Nudging him up, he rolls away, making quick grabs at their discarded clothes. Throwing Poe's at his still prone body, he shrugs on his shirt. "Get up, Poe. Y'know they can't do this without you." Poe harrumphs. "Wanna stay here with you." He tilts his head, just in time to see Finn slip into his pants. In the light of his quarters, he can see the still slick sheen of his come on Finn's skin. "Aren't you gonna clean up?" Finn turns away, not that it matters. Poe can see the burning tips of his ears. "I like having a reminder of you on me." He says simply, not stopping in dressing himself. Poe smirks at that. Clambering off the bed, he goes to Finn, pulling the man into his arms, pressing affectionate kisses onto the line of his neck. "Get dressed, Poe Dameron." Finn says quietly, just as the klaxons sound for a 5 minute warning. "And come back to me, okay?" Poe brings his hand to rest at where he knows his come is probably sticking to the fabric of Finn's pants. "Don't I always?" He grins, licking an unspoken promise into Finn's mouth.
