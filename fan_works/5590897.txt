The first time Rey and Finn hold hands, it's at the Niima Outpost on Jakku and they're running for their lives from First Order stormtroopers. Rey doesn’t understand why Finn thinks it's necessary to grab her hand to run and tells him as much. * The second time Rey and Finn hold hands, it's outside the Starkiller Base and they've just witnessed Han Solo's tragic death. Rey, half-blinded by tears and grief is stumbling in the snow. When Finn reaches out his hand to pull her to her feet, she doesn't protest and she doesn't let go. * The third time Rey and Finn hold hands, he's unconscious and in a medically-induced coma. There's a machine monitoring his vitals and his closed eyes flickering in a deep dream state. "I don't like holding hands because there's no point … people always let go and leave people behind in the end," she blurts out, her eyes not moving from his face. "Hey - he's gonna be all right – this one's a fighter, I can tell," Poe assures her. He takes her other hand – he's a bold one, this Poe Dameron - and they sit silently by Finn's side. * The fourth time Rey and Finn hold hands, Finn's eyes are opening slowly as he comes out of the coma. Rey's face is the first one he sees and his smile is filled with relief and delight. "Are you ok?" he demands. " You're the one who was injured and you're asking me if I'm ok?" she exclaims, shaking her head, torn between laughter and tears. * The fifth time Rey and Finn hold hands, they're alone in his quarters in the darkness, fingertips tracing over skin and learning what feels good and what feels even better. "Is this ok?" he asks hesitantly as he presses another kiss to her mouth, his hands sliding her blouse from her narrow shoulders. Her hand reaches out to take his as she guides him towards the bed. "It's better than ok …" fin
