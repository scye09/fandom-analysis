Poe thumbs tiny circles at the small of her back, idly carving a tactile leyline into Rey’s conscious. The act a gentle physicality in his mind, but an ocean of memories to her newly awakened senses. She drowns in it. She wonders if he knows: can he see her counting the stars above Yavin IV? Can he smell the pine tar ground into her clothes? Taste the fruit Kes abandoned on the counter? These are Poe’s memories: mundane and fragile, and full of needs she's never been aware of. He kisses her cheek and she knows: they’re in this together.
