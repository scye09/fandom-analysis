Miscellaneous Rey discovers the occupants of the bilge in Chapter 2: Cover Art for 'Edge of Night': Portrait of the Master and the Apprentice: Chapter 2 : Concept sketches and an abstract-y illustration Summary: All of these are worksafe. It's a couple concept designs, an abstract-y Rey illustration, and an attempt at coloring a Sidious pic ^_^ Dark!Rey Concept Sketch for Rey's Jakku outfit... I think she looks too much like Winona Ryder, but I dig the leather ^^ Concept Sketch for Sidious' Jakku Outfit... I edited a few things for the color version, which is below this one: Concept Sketch for Sidious' Jakku Outfit, colored... SITH SIGIL YAY...I may refine the face later: Chapter 3 : Worksafe: Sidious & Rey Taking in the View Summary: Worksafe pic of Sidious and Rey standing on a cliff on Jakku, seeing what they can see :) Drawn in pencil, inked with Microns, and then cleaned up a bit on my tablet in Autodesk Sketchbook. Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Taking in the View Detail: Notes: I think I like the 'sketch first, scan, then edit in Autodesk' thing better than the 'draw freehand on Autodesk' thing. I can get a better handle on the tactile nature of drawing this way, and it feels more natural. *shrug* We'll see how it goes.
