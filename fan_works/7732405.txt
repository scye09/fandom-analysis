Hello AO3 Users! My name is catsintherain, and I'm looking for a Beta Reader for my work: 'Dirty Dishes and... Kitchen Love?!'. I try to hold myself to a high standard for writing, and I hope my beta will hold themselves to a similar one as well. To be honest, the idea of another person looking and judging my work before is released, makes me really nervous, so I'll keep it simple. You will signed as a Co-Author, given credit and profile advertisement. I hope to have work done quickly, so typically within a couple days of receiving the text, I'd like to have it back, so I may publish it quickly. You'll have weekends off, so don't bother working then :). You can have vacations off if you want and you are more than welcome to take a day off for school or such. If you would like to talk about signing on, leave a message!
