Care to dance?" The masked man had his hand extended in question. The red-head looked at him, green eyes wary behind the forest colored mask. "Why not?" The gala was a peace treaty between the two ruling families in this sector of galaxy; the Hux's and the Solo's. The heads of the families had agreed to marry their sons. The men swayed in time with the music, observing each other quietly. Brendol could make out a pair of smoldering dark brown eyes, almost blending in with the velvet black mask that donned the raven's face. The red-head could feel the heat radiating from their intwined hands. "My name is Ben." The shorter man was taken aback, he hadn't expected the other to introduce himself. Didn't he know what the party was for? "I am Brendol, but please, call me Hux." The raven hummed in thought, "I like that. Hux." The name rolled off of his tounge in a purr. It caused shivers to move down Hux's spine. "I do hope you know who I am." Hux said, trying to regain his composure. "Of course not, the mask covers your face." Ben turned him, re-clasping their hands as an encore. "I am to be the Hux family's head soon." Hux pulled back, "No. My fianc√© and I shall be my fami-" OH. Hux's eyes widened behind the dark green mask, "Is-might your surname be 'Solo,' by any chance?" The man pulled off his velvet mask, "Of course." Hux gasped, "You- you're Ben Solo!" Ben nodded, an eyebrow raised on his uncovered face, "Yes," he paused, lifting his hand to take off the red-head's mask, "And you are Brendol Hux." Green stared into brown, Hux's mouth was dry. "Beautiful." It was barely a whisper, but Hux heard it. Then the crowd crashed together, separating the two. The music restarted, the Hux and the Solo drifted apart. 'Beautiful.' Ben whispered it once more as Hux stood next to him on the altar. And everyday after. Notes: Bad ending X( I'm this close to giving up on 'Fade Into You'
