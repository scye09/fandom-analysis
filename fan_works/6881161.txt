The First Order never taught their indoctrinated the concept of love. Yet, Poe taught Finn all the different ways people can communicate love. In an embrace, during a miraculous recovery after escaping a planet blowing up. In a cup of tea, after sobs and pain and finally coming to terms with what the First Order did to him. In a stolen kiss, after much pining and finally going what the hell . In a letter, carefully folded and kept in a pocket close to the chest, read over and over during times apart. Yes, there were many different ways to love, and Finn can't wait to discover them all.
