A shiver ran down her back as the guards marched her down the hall. Red lights reflected off her pale skin and made her platinum blonde hair seem to glow. The four Stormtroopers surrounding her moved away as they came to a stop in front of a set of black doors. Silently, she pressed her nails into her palm trying to keep a calm demeanor as Hux sneered at her. “You have five minutes. You know the rules.” Despite herself, she let a glare slip as he stepped aside. He returned it but said nothing. Turning to the side he opened the doors and she went inside. She held her breath and stepped inside. It was a bright sterile room, a medi-droid moving to the side of a bed. Slowly she walked next to it, and let out a shuddering breath. They had him strapped to the bed, so he couldn’t move. She gasped when she saw his face, the right side hidden beneath layers of bandages that traveled down his neck. He was naked from the waist up, his left side wrapped in bandages, his shoulders covered in sterile strips of gauze. Reaching down she laid her hand on his, and his face twitched at the touch. Slowly his eyes opened and he looked up at her confused. “Satine?” Reaching up she ran her fingers through his jet black hair, “I’m here, Ben, we don’t have a lot of time, but I’m here.” Her voice had aristocratic lilt of someone from Coruscant, or Hosnian Prime. She bit her lips readying herself for him to tell her to not call him by that name, but the usually biting words never came. Sniffling she set her hand on the right side of his chest, “I missed you.” “I tried to find you,” he whispered. “I know, you almost did, twice on Mandalore and Dantooine, but they kept moving me,” she said wiping her tears. He shook his head, and gripped her hand tight. He shook his head. “I killed him,” he rasped, “I killed my own father.” His pain pulsed in the Force like an open artery, the anguish spewing from the wound, rebounding against her own. She bit the inside of her cheek and nodded her head sadly, “I know. I felt it.” “It didn’t change anything,” he whispered as pain shot through his side. Satine’s emerald colored eyes stared at him as he tried to sit up, but the restraints kept him anchored. Panting in agony he laid back down and stared up at her, “You were right, I should have listened to you.” Satine glanced over her shoulder, “They’re going to come back in a few minutes.” Ben swallowed and nodded his head, “Go with them, keep your head low.” He tried to sit up, “I’ll find you, I swear--- gah!” Soft hands pushed him back down and he looked up at her, “You can’t keep doing this,” she said looking down his body, “They’re going to kill you---.” “I just need more time, when they find Luke---.” Satine shook her head, “He can’t help us. He won’t.” “He won’t help me, but he’ll do anything for you.” With a sigh she pressed the back of her hand to her brow and closed her eyes, “Ben…” An unfamiliar voice spoke behind her, “Time to go.” She turned around as the door behind her hissed, and two troopers marched inside. They moved towards her and she shook her head, turning around to stand between them and Ben, “No!” They aimed they pistols at her, and she flung her hand up in front of her, throwing one trooper back against the wall with a scream. With a yell she turned to the other trooper, but not before he let off a stunning shot. All the strength in her body faded away and she fell to the floor, her temple striking the edge of the bed. All faded to darkness. ************************************************************************************* Run, run, run! Breathing heavily the young woman slid to a stop and scaled the side of a great tree, using the vines anchored to its trunk as footholds. Red florakeets fluttered overhead, as she disturbed their canopy. Panting she stood and scanned the forest no sign of movement. Wiping her face she grabbed a free vine and rappelled down to the forest floor. “Good job, Rey, you’re getting faster,” a voice said behind her. With a gasp she spun around, as Luke stepped out from the shadows. He chuckled, “Though it seems we still need to work on your Force focus.” Shaking her head, she wiped the sweat from her face, “I’ve been running all day, what’s next?” The old Jedi inclined his head, “We’re done for the day. I think Finn was looking for you before we left.” Her eyes brightened and she shifted on the balls of her feet as though she was about to take off in another sprint back to the Resistance base. Luke laughed, “Go on.” “ She’s come a long way,” an ethereal voice murmured behind him. Crossing his arms Luke turned around. “She’s a quicker student than I was,” he said nodding his head to Obi-wan, “But she still has a long way to go.” ************************************************************************************* Naboo. How the hell did I end up here of all places , Satine thought to herself as they walked her down the ramp. The group came to a stop as several officers met them on the landing pad. “Koresh,” she seethed. He was a tall, thin man, with greying hair and an idiotic line of hair over his top lip. The lieutenant smirked and turned, holding his hand out for her to walk ahead of him, “Miss Kryze.” With a smoldering gaze she stepped forward, and walked ahead of him. They were on a lakefront, the estate elegant yet aged looking. It was almost peaceful, except for the troopers staged on the roof and perimeter. “I think you’ll find the accommodations here much more to your liking than any quarters on a star destroyer,” the lieutenant said as they entered the mansion. Satine turned around in the foyer, committing every exit and window to memory, “How long?” “I’m sorry,” Koresh asked. Turning around she looked at him with pure exasperation, “How long will we be here this time?” The man waved the guards around them to disperse, and stepped closer once they were alone, “The Supreme Leader has ordered me to make sure no one finds you. I think we’ll both agree this is the last place Ren will ever look.” Reaching out he tried to caress her cheek, “You should make yourself comfortable---.” Slap! Koresh’s head snapped as she struck him, “Do not touch me,” she spat. Turning around she picked up her light blue skirts and fled up the stairs, “I can find my room on my own.” Wiping her face she ran down the hall, before choosing a random door. Slamming it closed behind her she sunk to the floor, holding her face in her hands, “ Ben…” ********************************************************************************* “The scavenger, defeated you ?!” Snoke roared, his voice filling the atrium of the ship. Ren stood in the center of the room, a jagged scar running down the side of his face. “She was untrained, and yet you are the one who fell in disgrace!” “I was weak---.” “That woman, the Mandalorian, is that where this weakness originates?” Ren shook his head, “Satine--.” “Would be dead if not for my power. Remember what you owe me, what favor you begged of me,” the giant uttered, pointing a long gnarled finger at the man, “Her life is mine.” “The failure was my mistake,” Ren said bowing to the Sith lord, “I will not dissatisfy you again,” he murmured, glaring at the floor in rebellion. Snoke moved slowly, hunched over, until he was seated on his throne once more, “Your training is incomplete. Succeed, show your commitment to the Dark side, or I will kill your lover myself.” Chapter 2 Satine stood in front of the doors to her balcony, studying the lakefront, counting the number of guards and the time between each rotation. That won’t work, she thought begrudgingly, There’s nowhere to run to. Turning around she made her way over to the bed. It was an elegant and posh room, with antique furniture and artwork of Naboovian nobility. It was dark by the time they sent someone to check on her. Knock-knock. Slowly Satine glanced at the door, waiting for another knock. After a few seconds her visitor knocked again, “Come in,” she called quietly. Turning towards the door she leaned against one of the bed posts elegantly as a young girl entered the room. She was short and petite with long flaxen hair and sprinkled freckles across her thin, straight nose. With a bow the girl closed the door and stood in the center of the room awkwardly. Satine crossed her arms, “So you’re it, hmmm?” “My lady?” The woman on the bed rolled her eyes, “So you’re the one they want me to make friends with this time, in the hopes that it will make me less aggressive?” Standing up she brushed her hair over her shoulder and set a hand on her hip, “It’s Satine by the way. Since they’ll have you spying on me every minute, we might as well call each other by name.” The girl froze and stared at her wide eyed as Satine waited impatiently. Shaking her head she pressed the girl, “So? What’s your name then?” “K-Kaira,” the girl answered stiffly, her bottom lip. “And what did they threaten you with if you refused their orders, Kaira?” Satine asked turning her back on the girl. The girl stuttered again, “N-n-nothing, they d-didn’t threaten me.” “That’s what you all say at first.” Spinning around she studied the girl, “How old are you?” she asked suspiciously. “How old are you?” Kaira asked finding her gall. Satine smiled and chuckled, “Twenty-five.” “I’m nineteen.” Quietly Satine motioned to the loveseat across from her and they sat opposite one another, “What did they tell you about me? Anything interesting?” she asked, seeming genuinely interesting. “They said you’re a political prisoner.” Satine’s head tilted back and she let out an obnoxious laugh. Kaira flinched with every snort, and Satine set a hand on the girl’s shoulder, “I’m sorry… But that is so tame! They told the last girl that I was an insane rebel and that I murdered all the others in their sleep. It took me weeks to convince her that she could go to sleep around me!” Kaira frowned, “Then why are you really here?” Satine’s face fell and she stared at her hands that rested in the center of her lap, “It’s stupid really.” Narrowing her eyes, the older woman stood up and waved her hand closing the doors to the balcony without touching them. The girl pressed her body against the back of the chair, “You’re a Jedi?” Satine turned and shrugged. “Kind of.” “What does that mean?” The older woman sighed, “I’m not very strong. I was sick a lot as a child, you have to be physically able to use the Force but I was too weak… That’s sort of what got us into this mess. I missed out on training and when I---.” Satine shook her head, “I end up telling this story every time they bring someone new, you’d think I’d be better at it,” she laughed darkly. Kaira watched her silently as she began to tell her tale. “I was… five I think, when my family sent me to the academy. They were aristocrats from Mandalore, and they could afford to do it without Luke’s charity--- most students he found were poor or orphans.” She glanced at the girl as she sat down on the armrest of the couch, “Anyway, when I was ten I contracted Bybbec fever.” “My cousin had that,” Kaira whispered, “He died.” Satine nodded her head, “The Academy had state of the art medical facilities. They treated it but by the time they did, it was too late to not have complications. My heart, liver, kidneys,” she heaved a great sigh, “Basically everything was damaged. The medic said I wouldn’t make it past sixteen so they put me in charge of rebuilding the archives.” Kaira frowned, “Well clearly you did make it past sixteen,” she said looking Satine up and down, “And you don’t look that much worse for wear. What happened?” “I had a friend… a boy, a year or so older than me.” Satine looked down, “No one wanted much to do with me after I was sick. I was the one they pitied, the one who would never be a master or even a real Jedi, but Ben…” Her voice was heavy with pain as she uttered his name, “Ben was special, it was like he saw more than just some invalid categorizing the data stores.” “He did something didn’t he? What? Satine shook her head, “He did the worst thing he could possibly do…” They stared at one another as she whispered, “He saved me.” ********************************************************************************** Memories She’s standing in between the shelves within the archive room, placing tiny, blue glowing boxes in their correct positions. Straightening her back she peers up at the top shelf and stands on her tip toes trying to place the last holocron on the shelf. “Oh, come on… Ack!” A set of hands pokes her in the sides and she spins around with a scream. With short black hair, and splattered moles across his face, Ben moves down the row of shelves with a laugh, and she begins to gasp for air, holding her hand to her chest. His eyes widen and he begins to panic, “Satine! Shit I---.” She doubles over, and he catches her in his arms as she slides to the floor. He pushes her hair back and stares at her face, and she does her best but she cannot hold her laughter in anymore. Her guffaws fill the room, and Ben pushes himself away from her, “That’s not funny, I thought you were really dying.” She leans back against the shelving behind her, still laughing, “Then maybe next time you’ll think before you try to scare the living daylights out of me.” Shaking her head she stood up and tried again to put the holocron away in its cubicle. Before she can reach up though, it is lifted from her fingers by an invisible force. She turns around, watching as Ben waves his fingers and the box moves into place. She smiles despite herself and moves down the row, “Show off.” He shrugs and gives a small smile, “I try.” Shaking her head, Satine leads him back to the main desk of the archive room, “Oh I found something you might like,” she whispered excitedly. Ben watches her as she stoops low behind the desk, and pulls out another blue box. He raises and eyebrow and she holds it out to him, “I haven’t had time to watch the entire thing, but the input data said it belonged to a Jedi Knight from before the Empire.” Curious, he leans against the desk, taking the holocron from her hands, and turning it over in his own, “Who?” Satine grins, “Anakin Skywalker,” she whispers, wiggling her eyebrows. Ben almost drops the box in surprise, and she reaches out wrapping her hands around his without thinking. They both freeze. Blushing she pulls her hands back and pushes her hair behind her ear, clearing her throat. Ben stands straight and stares at the box, “Where, uh, where did you find this?” Twiddling her thumbs she shrugs, and looks to the side, “Your uncle brought it in a few days ago.” Satine bit her lip and crossed her arms, “I thought you would like to see it.” “Yeah,” he says nodding his head, as he stares at the holocron, “But you know we have to have permission to access the records.” “I won’t tell if you don’t,” she says mischievously. Ben shakes his head as she pushes the box towards him, “Just bring it back tomorrow, and no one will know.” He hesitates, his hand hovering over the prism, “Fine…” Picking it up he sticks it in his pocket, “Thanks Satine.” Turning around she sat down and started cataloging, “I don’t sneak top secret holocrons to just anyone you know.” He laughs and moves around the round desk, “Yeah, I know. I owe you one.” Chuckling she begins to type data into the computer, doing her best to ignore him as he watches her. With a sigh she glanced at him, and he cleared his throat, “You should come tomorrow.” Satine frowns, “Tomorrow?” Ben chuckles and clasps his hands, “You’ve been in here too long. Tomorrow’s graduation… you know where we all get our first assignments as knights, same as every year.” “Oh.” They stare at each other for a few seconds and Ben sighs, “You aren’t coming.” She scrunches up her nose, “I should probably just stay here, someone has to reorganize the Bothan holocrons, and don’t get me started on the---.” He stops her, his mouth falling into a frown, “Fine. I shouldn’t have asked.” Turning around he begins to leave the room, “Thanks for the holocron,” he spat. Satine stands and calls after him, “Ben…” but he disappears through the doors. She starts to follow after him and steps to the side when, “Hah ---.” Her vision blurs and she grabs the edge of the desk, trying to keep herself upright. Slowly she sinks to the floor, her chest feeling as though a gravity lock has been placed around her lungs. She is out of control. Her hands shake, her vision refuses to clear. Closing her eyes she struggles to breathe and leans against the desk, as her body slowly stabilizes. She stays there until she hears the door open again. Turning her head, she wipes her tears away, as footsteps run towards her. “Satine?” She looks up as Luke crouches down next to her. His face is full of concern and he stops her as she tries to stand, “Hey just hold on, you don’t look too good.” Reaching behind her he tries to pick her up, but she fights against him weakly. “No med bay,” she mumbles. Luke frowns and she says it again, “Please, not there.” He shakes his head. “It’s getting worse you really need---.” “I’m fine,” she says as she grabs the edge of the desk. Luke stands up as she pulls herself up, his hands ready to catch her if she happens to fall again, “I’d rather spend time here than in a bed,” she whispers, as she wipes her face. Luke sighs behind her. “You should rest. I’ll take you back to the dorms…” ********************************************************************************** The next morning… Satine leans against the door, her head pressed against the cool metal as she tries to overcome the vertigo she’s been fighting against since she first woke up. She’s dressed in brown and blue robes. They’re fancier than the bland tan robes she usually wears. She had to borrow these from one of the girls next door. She even has her hair braided back, showing off her face. With a groan she glances in the mirror again, “I’ll just stay until the ceremony is over, then I can get out of there before people notice.” Wiping her eyes she straightens up, the dizziness from before pushed back by sheer will. Giving herself a firm nod she smooths out any wrinkles then steps into the hall. Clasping her hands in front of herself she steps behind a group of girls and follows them downstairs into the atrium of the Academy. No one speaks to her and she keeps her head down, careful to avoid drawing any attention to herself. Quietly, she moves away from the group as they all enter the auditorium, and sits on the far side of the room. She spies Luke and the other two masters at the head of the elevated platform, watching over the black robed students in the center of the room. Younger students sit down beside her without a word and she fidgets with the ties of her robe as she scans the crowd in front of her, looking for one face. There! Ben stands in the front row, his eyes focused on the three masters as they begin the ceremony, calling students up one by one announcing them as knights. Her eyes focus on the boy as he walks up the steps and receives his own data pad with his first official assignment. Like all the others he gives a stiff bow before cross the platform to jot down the steps. Despite herself, Satine lets a smile slip, just as he glances up, his eyes focusing on hers. He cocks his head and raises and eyebrow in question and she shrugs, as the student behind him impatiently pushes him down the steps. The rest of the ceremony is finished and she waits as the other students around her clear the room. “Satine!” She turns around as Ben runs up to her, a smile on his face. She steps away from the crowd and clasps her hands behind her back. “Congratulations,” she says quietly. Ben smiles at her and runs his fingers over the arch of his ear, “I was hoping--- I mean, I didn’t think you were coming.” She shrugs, “Well, if you had stayed a little longer yesterday I would have told you I’d be here.” He looks down sheepishly, “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have run off like that… it was pretty childish.” Satine looks down and nods her head with a small smile gracing her lips, “Just a smidge.” A salt and pepper haired man calls from across the room, “Ben!” They both looked over his shoulder, Luke, the grey haired man, and a woman were all waving them over. Satine glanced at the door, the majority of students gone from the auditorium. “You should probably go, it looks important,” she said nodding to the group. Ben shook his head, and turned around. “It’s just my parents.” Satine chuckles, “ Just your parents?” Everyone knew about his parents, the war heroes Leia Organa and Han Solo. “You should come meet them.” She shakes her head, and glances at his parents reflecting their curious gazes. She holds up her hands, “I should---.” “Come on,” he says taking her by the hand and pulling her down the steps. “Okay…” She takes a deep breath as Ben leads her across the room and they come to a stop in front of the three adults watching them curiously. Leia raises an eyebrow. “Ben, who’s this?” Luke clears his throat and Satine stares over at him, “This is our archivist, Satine Kryze.” Satine looks down at Ben’s hand which is still holding hers. Clearing her throat she tries to let go but he holds firm. “Satine Kryze?” Leia asked, “Any relation to the Duchess Kryze?” Blushing Satine looks away from Ben and bows, “She was my grandmother.” Leia glances at Han with a smile, “My father served with her in the Senate before the Empire.” Han clears his throat, “We should get going,” he says with a nod to Luke. Satine steps back, as Ben lets go of her hand, and watches as Leia gives him a warm hug. Han just gives him a nod, before they leave the room with Luke. “They aren’t staying?” Satine asks, as Ben watches them leave. His face is hard and he shakes his head. “They need to get back to the Resistance.” She stands behind him, his back tense, “Are you alright?” Shaking his head he turns around and plasters on a smile, “You never told me your grandmother was a Duchess.” “You never asked.” “So what does that make you?” She raises an eyebrow, “Nothing?” He crosses his arms, “Really?” “When my grandmother passed, the family lost its seat in the Mandalorian hierarchy. We’re just merchants now.” She tilts her head and adds, “And archivists.” Ben laughs and looks down at her, “I almost forgot.” Satine stares up at him, her blue eyes traveling over his face, before coming to rest on his lips. “What?” He reaches inside his robes and pulls out a blue cube, “I was supposed to give this to you, remember?” Understanding, she swallows and looks away, “Yes.” Making sure no one is watching she reaches out and takes the holocron back, “Anything interesting?” Ben shakes his head, “He didn’t make a lot of sense, it was probably right before Order 66, before the Fall.” Quietly, she sticks the cube in the arm of her robe and looks back up at him, “I’m sorry, I thought it would be more worthwhile.” “What makes you say that?” he asks, and she cocks her head. Reaching up he pushes a stray strand of hair behind her ear, “I got to see you again, so it was worth it in my book.” He peers down at her from beneath long black eyelashes, and his warm hand moves across the nape of her neck. She stares up at him with her lips parted. “Ben…” Ever so slowly, so gradual it seems to take an eternity, he leans down and she closes her eyes, as he kisses her lightly. It is like two conduits crossing paths, and electricity seems to arc across her skin. She melts against him, as he wraps his arms around her, until his tongue slips inside her mouth, and she opens her eyes and pushes him away. They stare at one another, and she presses a hand to her chest, trying to breathe, but unable to draw in any oxygen. It is the same feeling she gets when she was about to have one of her attacks. Her heart pounds so loud she can hear it, her lungs burn, and her hands begin to shake. It is stifling. “Satine?” he asks, his voice echoing in her ears as blood rushes to her face. Looking away she swallows and tries to move past him, but he stops her laying his hands on her shoulders lightly. “Hey---.” Reaching up she slaps his hands away and runs past him, leaving him behind in the Academy’s atrium. ****************************************************************************** Days later… “The last of the knights left this morning,” a girl murmurs behind Satine as she walks towards the archives. She keeps her eyes focused on the floor as she walks. She hasn’t seen Ben at all since the graduation ceremony. Although, her conscience politely reminds her, she hasn’t really gone out of her way to seek him out either. Now he’s gone. With a sigh she enters the room alone, and begins to filter through the holocrons. Filling her arms she begins to place them about the room, in the order really only she knows. In the back of the room, she reaches up and places the last holocron on its shelf when it happens. Her chest seizes and she lurches forwards, trying to breathe, trying to cry out in pain. Instead she coughs and what little air she has in her lungs escapes. Something wet drips from her mouth, and the irony taste of blood washes over her tongue. Reaching up she wipes her lips, red blood staining her grey sleeve. Weakly she stands up, using the shelves as support as she makes her way to the door. Holding out her hand she focuses and manages to push the door switch and it opens. She can hear people moving down the hall, and she falls to her knees at the threshold. “Help…” Everything fades to complete and utter darkness. Chapter 3 Sunlight came in through balcony doors, and Satine crossed her arms, trying to stay asleep. Opening one eye she looked across the room, Kaira passed was out on the bed, her feet hanging off the edge of the mattress as she snored. Satine shook her head and sat up as the door opened. She glanced up as Koresh stepped into the room, “Lieutenant.” He glared at her, “You’re wanted in the command center.” “Why?” “Why do you think?” he spat, “The Finalizer sent a transmission a few moments ago.” The man looked around the room, “Would you like me to tell them you’re preoccupied?” Snapping his fingers, a woman came into the room holding a blue silk dress, fringed in white. “I took the liberty of securing some clothes from the previous owners. “No.” “Then I suppose you’ll be fine in those rags for the rest of your time here?” he asked smartly, “Although I’ll be the first to admit that ripped garments are very becoming on you.” Satine stood up, “Shut up.” Without a glance she stalked over to the woman and took the dress before slipping behind the dressing screen. ****************************************************************************** Two guards stood behind her, pushing her onto the transmission platform as the one opposite of her booted up. Clasping her hands she held her breath as Ben came into focus, his hair longer than the last time they had seen one another in the med bay. He stared straight at her, as her eyes focused on the scar that marred his face. She hadn’t seen him without bandages before then and it made her chest hurt. “It’s not as bad as it looks,” he said quietly. Satine shook her head but said nothing. Ben crossed his arms, “Are you alone?” She glared over her shoulder at Koresh, who simply smirked at her, “Am I ever alone?” she asked turning back around. Ben nodded his head and looked her up and down. “Nice dress.” Satine rolled her eyes, “It feels like something your grandmother would wear,” she said, glaring down at the dress for emphasis. “I think they may have actually found it---.” “Ahem,” Koresh cleared his throat, “Please refrain---.” “We know the rules,” Ben spat. “Then perhaps you can abide by them Lord Ren? I would hate to relocate her again, when we only just arrived.” Ben glared over Satine’s shoulder, “I bet you would.” Holding up her hands she stepped so that she was in Ben’s line of vision, “Where are you? What does Snoke want now?” The man stiffened and looked down, “He wants me to find the Resistance base, and capture the girl and kill Luke if I have to.” Satine scrunched her nose, “What girl?” “I believe he is referring to the woman who escaped his custody on Starkiller base, and gave him that scar,” Koresh cut in. Satine turned around and hissed in unison with Ben, “Shut. Up.” A few seconds later Ben growled out, “Get out.” Koresh looked between them and Satine set a hand on her hip, narrowing her icy blue eyes, “You’re recording us anyway, you can at least give us the appearance of privacy.” The lieutenant set his jaw and bowed, “As you wish.” With a silent sneer he left the room, and Satine turned back to Ben who was watching her, worry plain on his face. “Have they hurt you? Has he done anything?” “No,” she said wrapping her arms around herself like a shield, “They’ve left me alone. Where are you?” she asked her voice desperate. Ben shook his head, “Near the colonies. Our spies report that they’re somewhere in the Outer Rim.” Satine sighed, “They brought another girl last night. She seems innocent enough. I might be able to use her.” He looked down and didn’t say anything. She frowned, “Ben, what’s wrong?” His voice was barely a whisper, “I can’t… they want me to kill Luke… I can’t . I already killed Han, now they want me to tear myself apart even more---” She took in a short breath and nodded her head, “Then don’t do it,” she whispered firmly. “Satine…” She smiled at him sadly, “Leave the First Order. They can’t stop you, they never could.” “They’ll kill you,” he said staring at her ashamed. “I know,” she said stepping closer to his hologram. Reaching up she ran her fingers over the edges of his figure, the blue light scattering across her skin as she touched it. “I’m alright with that as long as you’re safe. I can’t watch you kill yourself like this anymore.” “I never wanted this to happen,” he whispered. Looking down she nodded her head. He had said that only a few times since this all began. Once, immediately after they had been separated, another time when they had been running for weeks trying to escape from one of the many bases she had been secreted away to, and finally he was saying it now. Every time it made her heart feel as though it was going to break into a million pieces. He stared down at her, “I will find you,” he said, making his choice clear. Swallowing she stepped back, as he prepared to sign off, their allotted time together yet apart, almost over. “I love you, Satine.” She bit back the tears that threatened to spill onto her cheeks and stared at his face, committing it to memory, “I love you too.” A small smile slipped onto his lips as he looked over her body, “You look good in Naboo fashion.” Satine kept her face straight as he turned around and raised his hand. Then, he was gone. Slowly she turned around as Koresh came into the room. “A short visit,” he said smugly, “Especially since you won’t see one another again for a while,” he taunted. Satine looked down at her feet, and moved past him, “Not too long though,” she murmured as she walked down the hall. Notes: ***Sighs*** I don't have a problem... It's not like I post WAY too many Kylo fics... 0_o
