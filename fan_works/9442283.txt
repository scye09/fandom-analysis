“What gift would you like?” their host asks, smiling between them. “…we don’t need any gifts, thank you, your hospitality has been more than enough,” is Kylo’s immediate (and polite) response. “Nonsense! On such a joyous occasion we must recognise the commitment you have made to each other, and celebrate the fact you shared it with us!” “…it’s okay, we’re f–” “Ky, let the woman give us the gift. You don’t want to be rude, do you?” “I’m not being… Poe…” Kylo tries to communicate with his eyebrows, but Poe isn’t paying attention. “We need to keep the mission official.” “It would very much honour us,” the woman says. “But if you are not ready to form such ties…” “We’re ready,” Poe says. “Very ready.” *** “…Kylo, I thought she meant ties with the Republic , not between us .” “That’s why I am the diplomat, and you’re the pilot!” “I was just trying to be friendly!” “You were so friendly you accidentally married me so you didn’t hurt someone’s feelings .” Kylo watches as Poe rubs the back of his neck. “This isn’t gonna go down well with your mom, is it?” “She will likely laugh and offer to divorce us.” “Hey, we just got married. You really want a divorce this soon? Gimme a chance!” “We could just keep it between us, and… if we… uh… if we decide later we want to stay married, we could have an official ceremony and pretend to everyone we weren’t already married?” “We’re going to be fake-not-married?” “…yes.” “Kylo, I love you,” Poe says, and leans up to kiss him. “I accept.” “ You already did .” That’s the problem. And they can’t divorce right off, anyway, or risk bringing dishonour on their new ‘friends’. “I expect gifts.” “You got them, babe. Anything for my husband.” “ Don’t call me that, yet !” “Whatever you say, ball and chain.” Poe is going to need to buy a lot of gifts, Kylo thinks. A lot.
