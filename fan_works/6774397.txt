Okay so, Hux didn't remember how but somehow he and Kylo Ren were arguing about strategies and it somehow led to a furious make-out session with lots of moaning and now Ren was stripping him down while they kissed... ...Before this, Ren was not aware of how many freckles were on Hux's body. Or if there were any at all, besides his face, when he forgot to put on that stupid cream that covered them. (Kylo secretly wished it happened more often, it was cute.) Freckles were like beauty marks to Kylo. He was very lucky, because Hux had an incredible amount of them. From his face, to his shoulders, his back, his chest, his neck, his legs and even his ears were covered in freckles. It was amazing. Hux was amazing in general. Hux's skin was like beauty itself, freckles spread everywhere like a galaxy of stars in space. Kylo loved them. He wished he could count them, kiss every single one of them and tell Hux how much he loved him. He would get hypnotized by the constellations of them... They really stood out beautifully against Hux's pinkish pale, sensitive skin... Kylo pulled away from the sweet, yet passionate kiss. "Hux?" He caressed his right cheek while staring into his amazing blueish green eyes. "What?" Hux stared back. Kylo smiled warmly. "I love you so much Hux. You are my freckled beauty and no one will ever take you away from me." Notes: This will probably be the best thing i'll ever write, honestly. Sorry for the "in general" pun. xP My Tumblr is Kylux-Fangirl...
