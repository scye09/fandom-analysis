“I’m going to take care of you, okay?” Poe says, holding Finn's hand. They've had so many years together now – they’ve been through hell and high water and everything in-between. The air is thick around them, like they’ve been swallowed up by smoke and the gurgling screams of the dying. “I’m going to take care of you, okay?!” Poe screams, because Finn hasn't said anything and his chest has stopped moving and his eyes are staring up with his pupils blown wide in death and it's the first (and last) time Poe's ever lied to his husband. Poe screams again.
