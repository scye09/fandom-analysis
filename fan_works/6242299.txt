It’s been raining all day, the sounds of droplets on the roof of their tent weaving together, merging into one, strong, powerful. Just like us, Finn thinks, and Poe kisses him, again; and the air is too hot, making Finn dizzy, but he doesn’t stop kissing Poe, he never stops, never will. The rain lets up and the last rays of the setting sun make the tent glow. Poe pulls the flap open, and Finn stares into the world outside in awe, the colours muffled yet bright, the world quivering and uncertain, like an unfinished painting- “Aquarela,” Poe says, “Watercolour. Beautiful.” Finn turns to nod his agreement, but Poe isn’t looking at the sunset. Poe is looking at him.
