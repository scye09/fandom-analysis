Arkanis was excited to have the famous Princess Sommer at their planet. Everyone knew that is she being courted by their own General Hux, who belongs to the famous Hux family. Huxâ€™s family run the Planet. But no one expected that General Hux would ever court a future queen. His Father Brendol likes to boast about his son ruling the Galaxy, but no one ever paid mind to it. It was two days before Princess Sommer was seen in the public eye due. She was seen strolling with the General Hux at the national park. They were kissing on the bench. Nearby was her lady in waiting, Simone, and a technician named Matt. They were spotted having a romantic picnic. Matt fared poorly with the red lady. The next day, the Princess Sommer and her entourage visited General Hux's old primary school. They gathered all the children at the gym to see the Princess. There she was greeted by each child. One little girl ran up and hugged her, one boy gave her flowers and she hugged him, and a few of girls showed the Princess their dolls. The Princess decided to make it a play day. She went on to play with girls who had dolls. While her lady, Simone, played blocks with a mixed group of children. Matt was spotted sword fighting with a child playfully. General Hux seemed to be having trouble with the children. He gave up and sat in a chair. He was pouting like a child. Unlike her lover, Princess Sommer was a natural with children. She was so loving and down to earth that she sat down on the floor despite her wearing floor length dress. After school ended, General Hux was seen fighting with his Princess with Lady Simone and Matt bearing witness to his behavior. The Princess was then seen storming off while speaking her native language with her Lady in waiting and Matt. General Hux declined to comment on the subject.
