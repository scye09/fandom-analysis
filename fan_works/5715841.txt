My life is the legend of Orpheus - I'm going to become a dark god. I've known it for as long as I can remember. Born in a time of war when the universe was screaming, they told me I had power. I believed them. Some say I believed too strongly, but I protest- I just didn't like the restrictions they imposed. I studied. I know my strength. I can charm monsters from their caves, I can hold an audience spellbound with fear. I can save a hero from death. I know I can. Please, don't ask me to turn around.
