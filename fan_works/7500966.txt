"Im so sorry" "For the third time, father! I am doing perfectly fine in New York, and i am NOT going back to England! I DONT CARE WHAT YOU SAY!" Hux was sitting on his bed, arguing with his father on the phone yet again. What was it, the sixth time this week they had the same argument? He had recently moved to New York after turning 24 in hopes of finally getting away from Brendol and he had gotten very mad, wanting Hux to come back. Probably to have another poor little soul to torture. "Again, tell mother i'm sorry, okay?! I dont want to argue." he sighed. "I did NOT raise YOU to ACT LIKE THIS and DISOBEY ME! Four of your siblings have already left, and i HAVE DECIDED TO NOT LET YOU GO TOO! Now, you will respect my decision and come back OR, I WILL BE FORCED TO TAKE A PLANE OVER THERE, FIND YOUR SAD LITTLE HOUSE, APARTMENT, WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE SURVIVING IN, ARMITAGE, AND DRAG YOUR ASS BACK HOME!" Brendol Hux Sr. replied. "EXCUSE ME!" oh how Hux wanted to punch his father so badly. "I am TWENTY FREAKING FOUR AND I AM LEGALLY 6 YEARS PAST OLD ENOUGH TO MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS, EVEN IF THAT MEANS LEAVING THE HOUSE AND NO LONGER LISTENING TO YOUR ORDERS. I WONT GO BACK AND LIVE IN A HOME WHERE I AM NOT HAPPY JUST BECAUSE YOU REGRET HAVING FOUR LESS SOULS TO TORTURE! ITS LITERALLY BEEN A WEEK SINCE I LEFT AND I WOULD APRECIATE IF YOU LET ME LIVE MY OWN LIFE FOR ONCE!!" Hux was so angry he punched the wall as hard as he could. Once. Twice. Three times... He heard a loud crack sound. Holy shit. "Oh no. Oh no, no, no, no, no!" "What is it now?!?" his father angrily yelled over the phone. "I accidentally..." he left the sentence unfinished and hung the call. "Im so screwed." he whispered and put his head in his hands. "Oh... I hope they won't be mad... but what if they ARE mad? I dont want them to be mad... I guess there's only one way to find out." Hux inhaled. "Hello?! Is anybody on the other side?!" Silence. "Hello?!" he tried again. "What the hell happened?" spoke a deep voice coming from the other side. Must be his neighbor. "Umm... This is hard to explain but... I was... Having an argument over the phone and i... got so mad i punched the wall and... Accidentally broke a hole..." Silence. Again. "I'm sorry! Please dont get mad at me!" Hux peeked through the hole. "I can get it fixed myself, if you want. Just know that i really didn't mean to- OH MY GOD, YOU'RE NAKED!" he blushed, looked away and covered his eyes. His neighbor was a tall, dark haired, totally not handsome-looking man. "I'M SO SORRY! STARS, I FEEL TERRIBLE!" Hux felt like he wanted to cry. First he broke his neighbor's wall then he invaded his privacy. Way to go, Hux. He sniffed. What he certainly wasn't expecting was the response he got. "Are you okay?" spoke that deep voice again. "Huh?" "I asked if you were okay?" "You aren't mad?!" "No. It was all just an accident. You sound like you accidentally broke something important. Calm down. Now can you answer my question? Are you okay?" on the other side, he wrapped a towel around his waist. Hux thought about it. "No, i feel horrible." he decided. "I'm not going to kill you, please. Its not like the wall can't be fixed." "About the other... Thing... Im so sorry!" "Oh, that? I dont really mind. So you saw me, whatever. Another accident plus it couldn't have been for more than three seconds. By the way, my name is Kylo Ren." "Ummm... I'm Hux." "Well, Hux, nice name by the way, you sound like you really need a break from horrible things happening to you. I'd like to take you to a coffee shop i know nearby so you can calm the hell down." "Oh... I'd like that... but why are you being so nice to me?" Hux put a hand to the wall. "Well, for starters you sound pretty traumatized so i guess i just don't feel like yelling at you." Kylo smirked and started dressing up. "How about in ten minutes?" "Okay." Hux smiled. "I'll fix the hole when we get back..." Kylo chuckled. "Meet me in the hallway." ---- Ten minutes later. ---- Hux couldn't believe it... He had just met his hot neighbor and now he was going on a coffee date with him... It WAS a date, right? Anyways, he was in the hallway when his neighbor opened his apartment's door and looked him in the eyes. "Oh, you're a redhead." he curiously said. "Yes... Is- is that bad?" Hux asked shyly. "I guess you could say you're hot. Your hair is on fire, y' know." Kylo smirked. Hux blushed. Definitely a date. "And you have stars on your skin too." "Shut up." he covered his face and looked away. "What? You allergic to compliments, gingersnap?" "I hate you already." Hux replied smiling. "I know." Chapter 2 : Its an Awkward Kinda Date Summary: This was just gonna be a oneshot but noooo i had to leave it on a cliffhangerrrrr Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Together, they walked down the halls, then decided to silently walk over to the Coffee Shop. It was a nice evening. They stopped in front. "Here we are." Kylo said. "The First Order?" Hux curiously said. "Nice name, eh?" They walked in. "Quite different from what i expected. I mean, red and black leather chairs, and black stained glass square tables. Why does the counter have a red glowing top?" "I dunno. What would you know about coffee shops, anyways?" Kylo poked Hux. "I didn't say that was bad..." Hux smiled. "In fact, i kind of like it." "Really? Honestly, I'd thought you'd be more of the old school type of guys. Anyways, lets get some coffee." They walked to the counter where there was a female cashier with blonde hair cut short. "Phasma", her name tag read. She leaned over the counter and smiled widely. "Hey, Phas." Kylo greeted. "You know her?" Hux asked. "She's a friend of mine." "Kylo! Who's this?" she asked, surprised. "You on a date~?" "What? No!" Kylo suddenly felt less brave. "I just met him, he lives next to me and his name is Hux." "Neighbor, huh? And why'd you take him here with you? How did you meet? You barely have friends! And look, he's a ginger! Im so proud of you!" Kylo sighed. "He accidentally punched a hole in my wall and then looked horribly traumatized-" "I did not!" Hux interrupted and looked away with a sour expression. "Sure, sure. Anyways, i wasn't feeling like yelling at him so i just took him here so he could calm down and that's basically it, end of story." "That makes for quite an interesting introduction." Phasma said. "Hi, Hux. I'm Phasma, but you can call me Phas." she extended her hand out to him and he shook it. "Y'know, Ky, he's rather cute." Kylo looked away and groaned. Hux smiled at him and raised an eyebrow. "Oh, shut up." Kylo said. "I didnt say anything." Hux smiled wider. "So, what can i get you, guys?" Phasma asked with a smile. "You know, what i always order." Ren said. "Of course, burning hot coffee as dark as your soul to compliment your very dark and lonely life. How tragic." Hux swore Phasma had winked at the "hot" part and tried not to laugh but failed. Kylo decided he liked the sound of it. "And i'll add the whipped cream and caramel, too." "Do you have anything non-coffee?" Hux asked. "Yeah. We also sell milkshakes. And other stuff that compliments coffe, like cake, donuts, strudels..." "Do you sell strawberry milkshakes?" "Yep. That's what you want?" "Yes, please. And if you can add whipped cream and chocolate syrup, that would be nice." "Okay! He's got a nice taste, y'know?" Phasma went off to get their drinks. "Wait, does this mean you have a sweet tooth?" Kylo asked. "Umm, i guess, yes, is- is that bad?" Hux replied, suddenly nervous. "No... Just another reason to call you gingerbread man." "Wait what does that have to do? And since when do you even-" "Here you go!" Phasma cheerfully interrupted, placing their drinks in front of them. "I'm gonna pay since i was the one who ruined everything." Hux said, taking out his wallet. "But i was the one who asked you here!" Kylo protested. "And i'd like to return the favor, thank you very much." "But-!" Phasma sighed. "Congratulations! I'll let you get them for free!" "Oh... That's nice but you don't have to..." Hux tried. "No, no, no, no, no. I insist. Take. Them. For. Free. Now, enjoy your evening!" Phasma waved and went into the kitchen. Kylo took their drinks and walked to the stools next to a window. He placed Hux's drink down. They both sat. "I like your friend." Hux pointed out. "Yeah." Kylo sipped his coffee. There was silence while Hux stared out the window, drinking his milkshake using a straw. "So... who caused you to punch the wall? I mean, not to be rude or anything, but you said you were on the phone... " "Hm? Oh, um... my father. His name is Brendol. We... Dont exactly have the best relationship. I mean, I get it if you don't understand... It must've been different for you, i just happen to be unlucky and-" "No, i understand." Hux pushed his drink aside and looked up at Kylo. "You- you do?" "Me and my dad Han don't get along either. My family is weird. That's why i moved." Ren finished his coffee. "Really? That's the same reason why I moved. Well, at least my mother Maratelle is nice." "Well, Leia, my mom, prefers my cousin and her two boyfriends over me. She can ignore me for a whole day." "Oh, im sorry." Hux frowned and stared into his milkshake. Kylo stared at the night sky through the window. He sighed. "The stars, you know how i said your freckles reminded me of them?" "I dont know if i should be flattered or creeped out that you noticed them so fast." Hux stirred his drink with his straw. "You're pretty" Kylo said. "Are you sure?" Hux looked up at Kylo and blushed. "Dont be stupid, yes you are. How come you never noticed?" "I- thank you... No one's ever said that to me... You- you're pretty too..." Hux looked away and drank the last of his milkshake. They sat in silence for a couple more minutes. "It's late... I should be going back home and fixing the hole in the wall. Thank you for everything, Kylo. I feel better now." Hux said while getting up. Kylo grabbed his arm. "Sweets compliment bitter coffee... I bet you taste sweet after drinking that milkshake~" Hux's pupils dilated and he blushed deep red. "Kylo- what do you m- mean?" Ren stood up. Held Hux's hand and laced their fingers together. He looked Hux in the eye. Inched closer... And closer... And closer...... Closed his eyes, and then... They kissed. They. KISSED. Slowly, and sweetly... "OH. MY. GOOOOD!!!" Both their eyes suddenly popped open, startled. Too startled to actually move. Then. There it was. Phasma. Phasma interrupted them. With a huge, beaming smile. Of course it was her. Her eyes went back and forth between Hux and Kylo. "I KNEW IT! I JUST KNEW IT! I KNEW IT WAS A DATE! Kylo! I didn't know you could be so romantic. Im so happy for you!"
