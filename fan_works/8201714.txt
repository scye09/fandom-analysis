THE DEMON WITHIN (Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Kylo Ren’s thoughts when he sees his father) He is here. I can feel him. I turn and see him walking toward me…my father. I feel nothing. I see his face…He’s aged…his voice brings back memories from my childhood. I feel nothing. He thinks there is hope for me…. Wants me to come home… That life is gone for me…..forever Why do I feel conflicted? Damn tears! I feel them sliding down my face. Are they for the life I left? For my father - who stands before me? For what I know I have to do? His voice becomes a buzz in my ears A thrust into my heart…. I cannot leave the life I have now.. He doesn’t know the power, the seduction…the HOLD of the Dark Side of the Force. I have to destroy what I can no longer be… ….My father’s son!
