Poe POV: "Are you ready?" Finn asks me. I suddenly come out of my trance on my friend's voice. "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine." "You're nervous." He adds. I shake my head. "No, I'm not. I'm not nervous, I don't get nervous." Finn looks at me skeptically. "Alright fine. I'm freaking out. I can't believe this is happening." "You'll be fine. The both of you have waited for this for so long. Don't worry about a thing." I take a deep breath, and Finn pats me on the shoulder. "Let's go." - Y/N POV: "I don't think, I can do this." I look at my nervous self in the mirror. Leia places a hand on my shoulder. "You look beautiful, Y/N." "Thank you but, what if Poe-" "Y/N there is nothing to worry about. Poe will be so happy to see you. Just relax. This is your day." I give a small smile. "Thank you, Leia." - As Y/N walks down the aisle, Poe feels his heart stop and nerves dissapear. She looked absolutely beautiful. Y/N takes a deep breath as Poe takes her hand. She looks at him with big eyes, and he smiles at her. "I love you." He says quietly. "I love you, Poe."
