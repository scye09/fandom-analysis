Hey Everyone!! Um.....I will be taking a break for a bit. This isn't anything personal or anything. But some of the stories I have going will keep going. But the stories I have been working on gifting are still going to be released. Although there will be a delay. I am going on a hiatus for atleast two weeks or more. My life hasn't been too good. I really hope you all understand. And are willing to work with me here. Been struggling as to where most of my stories will go. And that is making me sad and tired. And I've been less motivated to write. As some feedback has been either hurtful or not encouraging. But I hope when I get back you all will still be ready to read my stories. And with much more vigor and zest for writing. Hoping you have fun and enjoy life. And I hope you all stay wonderfully brilliant loving people I know you to be! :-) Have A Wonderful Amazing Year! - Ashley_Winchester_77
