Chapter 1 "Hey! Rey! Wait up a minute!" Spied on by General Hux, Kylo Ren hurried to catch up with Rey as she marched through the snow-covered forest. Rey ignored him: She just wanted to get back to the rebel base in one piece. But it was too late to hide. Trying her best to look innocent, Rey turned around as a black-gloved hand caught her wrist. "What?" She asked, before waiting for Kylo Ren's answer. It didn't come, and she made to turn away again, but at last he said, a little edge of gruffness to his voice, "I....Um......Ehem....." Rey froze, and then, with a small sigh, began to walk off. But as she reached the clearing, something, perhaps their force connection, made the scavenger decide to stay. "Look. I'm sorry, but I don't want a fight with you, Ren..." Rey said, beginning to lose patience. Kylo Ren shifted uncomfortably, as his dignity started to ebb away. From behind his rock, General Hux leaned in closer to listen, but almost lost his balance and had to grab hold of a clump of moss to stop his presence being revealed.
