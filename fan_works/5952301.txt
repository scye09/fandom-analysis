Kylo couldn’t believe it. Of all the stupid, idiotic mistakes that had to happen. He stood up and pulled out his lightsaber and ignited it, fully intent on slashing up the first thing that he could find. The booth to his left caught his attention.

Satisfied he shut off his blade and sat back down. “Calm down Kylo,” Rey said, not even batting an eyelash at the destruction of the booth. “It was a simple mistake.” Kylo stared at her, disbelief evident in his eyes. “Confusing two five minute eggs and five two minute eggs are not a simple mistake!” Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 7 of the Drabble Dump series Next Work →
