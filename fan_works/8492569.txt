What was Hux supposed to do when the monster jumped out of him from an unexpected corner? Run? Punch him? Cry? His brain didn’t know how to react, but his body seemed to take over. He quickly kissed the actor, he expected the actor to jump back, not to reciprocate the kiss. So here Hux was, Halloween night, separated from his group, kissing a total stranger. A stranger whose mouth was plush and warm and perfect for kissing. A stranger who despite the gory Halloween makeup smiled warmly at Hux when they pulled back. A stranger who sheepishly gave Hux his number. A stranger who Hux was going to fall in love with. Notes: Haha I hate this sm, anyway...
