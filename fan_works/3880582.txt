When the Resistance first set up a forward base on the asteroid Tumblemaw, nobody had expected it to be anything more than twenty-square-foot room with gravity and atmosphere to store rations, fuel, and a few cots. Nevertheless, it became a sort of tradition for Resistance members who came by to leave something to make the place a little nicer, such as a refrigeration unit stocked with sweet drinks, a board with carved playing pieces, or a holo-entertainment unit with the latest songs.

Now come on, get me some caf.” “Can’t. Too comfortable. You get me some caf.” Twenty minutes later, they heard an X-Wing land. The airlock opened and Poe stepped through. He blinked in surprise at the two slouched figures draped over the couches. “Poe! Thank the Force you’re here.” “Could you, uh, get us some iced caf?”
