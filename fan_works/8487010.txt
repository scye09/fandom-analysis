This Is All Your Fault! "Kylo, may I ask, what are you doing?" Hux asked. Ren was in a questioning position on the ship's floor. "I'm searching for my holopad." Ren answered. Hux frowned. "Please do find your pad, I will not take money from my account neither the First Order's." Hux said sternly. Why couldn't Phasma or Lieutinet Mitaka accompany Kylo on this journey on this monstrous customized ship? What Kylo and he even doing on this journey? Hux sighed. "Ren, what are we even going?" Ren looked up from his mission on finding his holopad. "We're going on a vacation, we're going to a hotel." Ren stated calmly before resuming his mission. "Excuse me? What the fuck do you mean?! The Resistance can find us at a hotel, you know?! You dumbass!" Hux fussed, standing up. Kylo stood up also and pushed Hux back down onto the plush seat. Kylo straddled Hux. "Hux, calm yourself, this is the reason why we are taking a vacation. You are so tense and you're stressing yourself!" Hux glared at Kylo's damned helmet. "We are turning this ship around." Hux stated. "Too late, we're already here!" At least the hotel room was beautiful. Two beds, one black and one red, two bathrooms, etc. "Kylo, who paid for this?" Hux questioned. "I took it out of your account." Kylo said like nothing whatsoever was wrong. "Kylo! How much did this cost?!" Hux practically screamed. Kylo winced, "Only 100. They support the First Order!" Kylo said. Hux still frowned even though he was pleased that just 100 was taken out of his account. "So, how do you think I should style my hair?" Kylo said casually as he walked out of the bathroom. Hux jaw dropped and his face reddened. He quickly covered his eyes. "Kylo! WHY ARE YOU IN THE NUDE?! PUT SOME CLOTHES ON!!!" Hux screamed out. "Come down, Hux, I'm comfortable in my skin!" Kylo said. "I'' not comfortable seeing you in the nude, though!" BOOM! PEW! PEW! PEW! "What did I tell you? They were going to find us Kylo Ren sooner or later Kylo!" Hux said. Hux ran to look out the window. So many fucking ships. Hux sighed before walking to the door. "GO PUT ON SOME CLOTHES, KYLO!!! WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RUN!!!" Hux said and Kylo began throwing on clothes. Hux speed walked downstairs, so fast that Kylo couldn't even keep up with him. "Come on, Kylo!" Hux turned a corner and was met, face to face, with Rey. He grunted as he was shoved by Kylo who bumped into him. Rey smirked. Hux pulled out his blaster. "I forgot my lightsaber." Ren stated. "Dumbass!" Hux scolded! Whoosh! "Oh, my holopad was caught up in my robes!" Kylo said grabbing it. "Phasma sent a message! 'How is the trip? Are you two getting along?'. " Hux wouldn't mind is he died today. Rey charged at him with the blue lightsaber. Hux fired at her, one blast scraping her hip. "Damn it, Kylo! This is all your fault!" Hux said as he and Kylo were dragged off to a familiar looking ship.
