“I’m sorry, Ren, you’re not scheduled to come for another five minutes, thirty-two seconds.” Hux snapped his hips wickedly, driving his cock into one end of Ren and forcing a loud moan out the other end. “ Please , Hux,” Ren gasped, “I need it—” “Really, this is disappointing,” Hux said. “You…!” His admonition broke off into a whine as Ren clenched tightly around him. He drew a slow breath. “Oh, Ren ,” he huffed, “ that was a mistake.” “Isn’t faster better?” Ren begged. “You can get back to work sooner?” “Ren, Ren, Ren ,” Hux tutted at him. “No. I said this was for efficiency, not speed. There’s a difference.” He slid out of Ren’s hole, torturously slowly, only letting his cock fall away when Ren let out a strangled moan. “ Efficient actions take optimal advantage of speed and excellence,” Hux said, smacking Ren hard across the ass. “Actions that are simply fast are, well, usually disappointing.” He reached between Ren’s shaking legs and drew a gloved finger along the knight’s twitching cock. “Isn’t that right?” “Yes, Hux, of course, you’re right.” Ren’s head was thrown back, hair a sweaty mop curling over his forehead and clinging to his neck. His voice was trembly, his face was flushed, his bright red lips were parted, and his dark brown eyes were hidden behind lowered lashes. “You’re always right, Hux,” he whispered. “Please.” Hux hummed approvingly. “Very well.” He lined himself up and, without preamble, rammed violently back into Ren. “Remember,” he said, working to keep the strain from his voice as he thrust hard enough to drive the knight’s face into the mattress, “there’s still five minutes left. If I hadn’t had to lecture you, there would only be three.” Ren moaned and snuffled. “I’m sorry,” he sobbed. “I’ll be good…” “Oh, kriff ,” Hux cursed, his body suddenly overtaken with violent shuddering. He jerked, twitched, and collapsed across Ren’s back, disgusted with himself. “Your lack of discipline is apparently contagious.”
