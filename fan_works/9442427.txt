“Kylo, I sincerely doubt we’re… we look nothing alike!” “Neither do my mother and uncle, and they turned out to be twins ,” Kylo points out. “I am not taking any chances.” “If we are related, then it’s distantly, and we’re not reproducing, so–” “I am not fucking a relative, Hux.” “Fine, but I want you to know this is weird.
