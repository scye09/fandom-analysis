"I'm well aware of your appalling record in that department, so I've made one for you. If you bring scum here, then you will clean it up within six hours." "A time limit?" Ren asked, tilting his head a fraction. "Perhaps your talents would expedite the process. You're welcome to join us." "How generous, but no. He's all yours." Hux waved a hand dismissively and turned to leave. "Try not to make a mess." "Oh? You seemed to enjoy the last time we worked together, General." Ren's voice dropped lower. "And I cleaned that mess thoroughly, didn't I?" Hux paused to aim a thoughtful glare at Ren. "I'll consider granting you twelve hours," he amended, flat and brusque, "based on your performance." "And that will start...?" "When I'm done with you." Ren hummed. "What about--" "--My ship, my terms, Ren."

I really hope that Kylo continues to annoy Hux with unwanted prisoners in future canon.
