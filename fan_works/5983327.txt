(Y/N POV) "Your a psychopath!" I yell at Captain Kylo. He crosses his arms "I prefer the term, creative" He snickers and shakes his finger at me. "Ignorant CHILD" He screams, slamming his fists on his oak wood desk. The ships rocking makes his little puffer fish lamp sway back and forth. I always hated that thing, so unoriginal and cliche, but Kylo liked it so I didn't complain. "Sir, we can't keep capturing and butchering innocent people like this! It's unhealthy and cruel" Kylo scoffs and and leans over his desk, his eyes piercing my own. If looks could kill id be dead in an instant. "Unhealthy, cruel, and butcher are my game, darling." I stare him down and turn to walk out "Well then you have pretty weak game." I slam the door shut and stroll out the the deck. "Attackers on port side! Ready the cannons!" Quarter master Hux yelled at the crewmen. I look up at the crows nest, empty. I walk over to the pole and start to climb the weak rope ladder. Finally reaching the Crows nest, I look out to see our attackers, the pirate gang, The Ljus. I panicked, knowing Captain Kylo had a major problem with them. I heard a story about Kylo recking the whole ship because they took his prized booty. I suddenly felt pity for the man. I try to shake that thought from my head, what's wrong with me? I think about the captain once more and my face lights up red and a bright peach. Do I have feelings for our beloved Captain? ___________________________ (Kylo POV) The Ljus "There here for me, those bastards! That won't take my crewmen this time! Or my sailing master, she's the best navigator around!" My face turns a deep red and I can't help but smile "(Y/N)...." I let out a deep sigh and shake my head violently "I can't catch feelings for out Sailing master, she probably doesn't even like me, I treat her like shit" I sit in my spiny chair and I sway back and forth while thinking of (Y/N). The door busts open and I see our Quarter master, Hux. "Captain, we can't take them all, we need your help" Hux is out of breath and his uniform is torn slightly at the waist. "Hux, are you ok?" He looks down at his side and a shocked look appears on his face. "(Y/N)! Sailing Master!" I yell, I'm not sure if she'll hear over all the cannon and hand gun shots. I run out on deck and see her in the crows nest,looking out at sea. She looks beautiful doing that I snap out of it and I call up "(Y/N)! We need your help!!" She looks down at my and climbs down the rope ladder. "What is it, captain?" "Quarter master Hux is seriously I ingered, we need your help to treat him." She nods and I lead her to Hux. ___________________________ (Y/N POV) "It's gonna sting, but just for a second, ok?" I lean over Hux in a white room at the keel of the ship. His shirt is undone, exposing his small, tan body. His eyes are closed, he looks so peaceful not yelling commands with his hoarse voice. "Here goes nothing" I take the medication and pack it on the wound. Hux lets out a blood curdling snarl and reaches for my throat. Pulling me down to his face he screams "ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME!?" "S-sir... I-I told you-u it would h-hurt..." I struggle to get out. Huxs face softens and he lets go "I'm- I'm sorry, I don't know what can over me.... Continue." I'm shaking violently as I finish putting on the medication. "It should heal by a few hours, ok?" I say putting it away. I hear Hux let out a deep sigh, I know he's staring at me, I can feel it. "Ok...." He lets out softly and closes his eyes once more "Can you play with my hair? It helps me fall asleep?" I was somewhat surprised Hux was acting like this, but I can't pass up the opportunity of seeing him so vulnerable. I walk over to the bed and get in with him "Is this ok?" I pull him close to my chest and he nods. Twisting my fingers trough his hair, messes it up, he looks quite handsome with shaggy ginger hair. I smile as I see his eyes start to close, and drift off to sleep. He's quite handsome My eyes were getting droopy. I was just about to close my eyes when the door slammed open "(Y/N) we need your help on-" Captains face turned to a scowl at Hux. "What's going on here?" "He couldn't sleep so I'm aiding him, it's ok" I push Huxs hair out of his face and kiss his forehead. As I get up out of the bed Hux groans and reaches out his arms "Don't go..." He says sleepily. I look at Captain then and Quarter master. I frown a bit and kiss Huxs forehead once more "I'm sorry, I have to help on deck" Hux smiles at the kiss and snuggles deep down in the covers. Captain Kylo wasn't too thrilled about what he just witnessed. Slamming the door shut made me jump, "What was going on in there!?" He scolds me "Nothing sir, I was just aiding him, and I quite enjoyed it!" "Don't do that next time! Don't enjoy it!" My face was full of hurt and disgust, "Why do you care!" I spit at him "Because I care about you!" His face softens realizing what he just said. I looked shocked as my face flushed red "I-I have to go" I turn to the stairs going up to the deck. "Wait-" He yells but I ignore him and keeps walking.

Hope you all enjoyed! I will be posting every other day! Thanks! - Kylos Nose Chapter 2 : Chapter two (Captain Kylo POV) I lay awake, staring into the darkness of my quarters. I sigh and look over at my puffer fish lamp, letting out a soft glow. (Y/N) never liked that lamp, I don't know why but she said its "cliche". I think it's quite nice and fashionable. I can't help but think of (Y/N), her smile lights up my whole world. I lay my hands on my forehead, a warm tear rolls off my cheek. I start sobbing, letting out screams and pleads. " (Y/N)!" I scream at the door. I stand and pace the floor, my hands in such tight fists my knuckles turn white. Letting out a animalistic yell, I take out my sword and slash at the opposite side of the room. As I go to thrash the door it opens, I hurry and pull back. "(Y/N)? What are you doing?" I ask sheathing my sword and sitting on the edge of my bed. "I heard yelling and crying from your room, then I hear you scream my name, I had to make sure your ok" She sits on the bed with me and looks at my tear stained eyes. "I'm not OK" I say about to cry again, I look away from her, I can't show weakness around her. "What's wrong?" "I've been having nightmares, about you..." I stop and look at her, waiting for her response. "What are they about?" I begin to tell her but I stop, she can't know what I feel inside. "Nothing..." She frowns and grabs my shoulders "It's ok... You can tell me anything" I sigh and begin again "You died, the Ljus took you and they killed you" I had to tell a small white lie, I can't tell her the whole truth. "Oh, sir, I promise you that won't happen" she hugs me and reassures me that she'll be fine, but I can't fully calm down. "(Y/N)" I say shakily "Yes?" "You can call me Kylo, but only when we are alone together" She smiles softly and kisses my forehead. I love her, but I can't admit it "Ok, Kylo" she says sweetly and stands up to go but I grab her wrist "Can you stay? So I can sleep?" I blush a bit and turn away. I feel soft, warm hands pull my face forward and I look into her eyes "Of course" I smile and lay back on the bed. She gets in beside me, laying her head on the crook of my neck. "Sleep now" I commanded her and let my eyelids fall freely over my eyes. ___________________________ (Y/N POV) I wake up hoping Kylo would be there with his long arms wrapped around my waist, but he wasn't there. I sigh and sit up, I can't think about him like that, I was just doing him a favor so he could sleep. I shake my head, clearing my head off all impossible thoughts, then stand up. "Ugh, that stupid puffer fish lamp" I smile at it, it makes me think of Kylo and that's why I hate it so much. Walking out of Captains quarters I hear footsteps down the short hall way. I jump and walk over to my quarters. "Hey, Sailing master" one of the first mates said. "Hey, Adam" I smile and open my door. "We're having a meeting on the main land, Captain Kylo told me to warn you, your more than welcome to come." I nod "Thanks" I walk in my quarters as Adam walks back to the deck. I change into my wardrobe, it's a long blue great coat with gold and white accents, white button up under shirt, tight brown pants, brown boots with gold and blue claps, accents, and rubber bottom, and to top it off a blue and white captains hat facing sideways. I look in the mirror. Not good enough for Kylo I put my hair in a loose bun and put white gloves on. "Good enough" I say while putting on a multiple necklaces. "Oh! Last but not least" I walk over to my bedside table and pick up my hand gun, putting it in my belt. I flatten my shirt down to my chest and clear my throat. A/N Hope you enjoyed!!! Had nothing to day today so wrote a short chapter! -Kylos Nose Chapter 3 : Chapter three (Y/N POV) "(Y/N)" I hear Kylo call to me. "Yes sir?" I walk off the ship onto main land where Kylo sit on a small chair next to a table, spread all over the table is a map and some quills. "Sit, we need to talk a moment" I sigh and sit down, for I want to adventure not have a little "talk". Looking at the map I notice a plan, a route, to an X marks the spot. "We need you to find this X, there is treasure burried there and we need to to pay of the Amarta clan." I lean back in the chair to ponder a bit, finally making my disition I sit up and place my finger on the map. "Only if you tell me the routes and not leave me with just this map." I look up at him with my eyes and scan his pale face. "Of course, wouldn't want you to get lost in an unfamiliar place now, would we?" An evil smirk appears on his face. I shake my head and take a good look at the map. "I'll do it, sir." "Perfect." He said while standing up and handing me the map. "Be back before sundown, please" "Your not my mother" I giggle and take the map. ___________________________ I'm walking through this forest. It's hot, wet, and humid. I take out the map and study the direction I'm supposed to be going in. "North East is..." I take a pause to look at my compass "....That way" I point a finger. Walking I stubble across a bump in the ground. "That's... Odd..?" I kneel down and start to dig it up with my hands. A handle pops out of the ground, I go to grab it and pull it out of the ground. It's a captains sword all damaged witch made it cool and dangerous. "Woah" I swing it around a bit. It's light, easy to swing, and cool looking. I stuff it in my belt and continue walking North East. ___________________________ I exhausted, tiered and exhausted. "I can't go any farther..." I lay on the cold sand, running it through my sore and blistered hands. Sighing at the sensation I pull out the map. I gasp, the X marks the spot should be right here. Looking over to my left and my right I see a man, digging. "Hey! You sir?!" I yell crawling towards him. He looks at me and stops digging, "Yes?" He walked towards me. "Lemme help you up" He grabs me and pulls me to my feet. "What are you doing?" I ask brushing sand off me. "I found this X marks the spot, so I'm digging it up" My face lights up as I gasp, "I'm looking for that, look!" I pull out the map and show it to him. "I'll give you some if you give the rest to me, it's for Captain Kylo, the captain of the S.S StarKiller ship." The man cringed at the name. "Your park of the Mork pirates aren't you?" "Why yes I am, I'm a sailing master, the best one around" I sand tall and turn my nose up "Thank you for noticing" The man just nods and frowns "Well, if it's for your sake to live you can have it" "Wait- what? Really?" "Yes, Captain Kylo can be very mean when he doesn't get what he wants." "Yes he can.... Hey, what's your name?" "Poe, I'm the ships crows nest men, I keep watch" "Oh, nice to meet you Poe, I'm (Y/N)." I smile but he frowns. He takes a step back and tears fill his eyes. "You seem really nice, and I'm sorry I have to do this to you... I'm sorry" My face went grim as pirates spilled out of the forest, grabbing at my arms and waist. "Poe! You sen me up! You bastard!" I scream and cry "KYLO!!!" CAPTAIN KYLO!!" I yell but no one comes "I'm sorry (Y/N)." He turns away and everything went black. ___________________________ (Kylo POV) It's been three days and (Y/N) still isn't back, I told her to be back by sundown. I'm panicking and I shouldn't be. Maybe it was harder to find than I anticipated Maybe she fell asleep Maybe she got killed Maybe, maybe, maybe Never ending maybe thoughts running through my head, they won't stop. I try to force it out of my head but I just end up hurting myself. Sighing I stand up and walk out on deck. "Sir, are you ok?" I hear a familiar voice behind me. "No, Hux" I set my elbows on the railing and place my head in my hands. "Three days and she's still not here, I'm broken." (Y/N) and Hux are the only two that have seen Kylo so vulnerable and scared. "It's ok Captain, she'll be back soon, I promise you" Hux sets his hand on my shoulder and smiles softly at me. He takes it off and his face goes back to its original stone cold state. "She'll be here soon..." He repeats. Hux walks back off to his quarters. I still stand there, staring into the forest, listening to its sounds. "Please come back soon, (Y/N)" Tears start steaming down my face, before I know it I'm lying on the floor, sobbing. I scream and yell, she doesn't run to my side this time, to aid me sleep. I lay there and let the creaking and groaning ship lull me to sleep. My tear stained eyes slowly close. A/N Thank you for reading!! :D Hope you enjoyed Songs: Control - Hasley Home - Daughter Chapter 4 : Chapter four (Y/N POV) "Where's Captain Kyo?!" I yell through the dark room at a dark figure. I woke about an hour ago, in a cold dark room. Only one light lit in the middle, it shown slightly on a man standing in the corner. I struggled to get up but I was strapped to a slanted table with bindings on my wrists, ankles, and waist. Who ever the person was in the corner, they didn't want me leaving. "Who are you?" I manage to spit out. The figure just starts walking towards me, not saying a word. "I said WHO ARE YOU!" I struggle harder against the bindings, leaving harsh rashes on my wrists. The figure got closer, I could see it more clearly in the dim light. It had a long brown cloak, a black belt, and a sword hung from the belt. I look down, not wanting to face it. "You know who I am." The figure spoke, In a male voice. "I do?" I look back up. "Yes..." There was a long pause, and almost awkward silence. The silence of the cold dark room was broken when the man slowly lifted up his hands up to his cloak, and began to slowly put it away. I winced and looked away, I don't want to see his face. The hood slowly falls to his shoulders as he lets go, his hands lower and he sighs. "Look at me child, I'm not going to hurt you." He places a cold hand on my chin and softly forces me to look at him. I let out a small gasp, it's Luke Skywalker, the most famous Ljus side pirate. "Do you recognize me now." I gulp hard and nod my head. Flash backs go around in my head like a tornado. There's me with Luke on a island together, him training me. Captain Kylo taking me from him. Luke crying and stay on that island alone, forever. Then I see me and Luke in that room, but instead we are holding eachother, and I am a young child. Then it occurs to me... Luke is my father. A/N Sorry for the mega short chapter!!! I will try to upload a longer on again today!! I had writers block ughhh! I hope you enjoyed!!! Please let me know in the comments if there's anything you want to happen later on in the story!! Thank you! - Kylos Nose Chapter 5 : Chapter five (Luke POV) (Y/N) gave me a look of sadness and dis pare. "(Y/N), I am your father." I couldn't think of anything else to say. A deep heavy silence filled the room. "(Y/N), I'm so sorry." I brought my hand up to her cheek and kissed her forehead. "Your my Flower, and I should not have let Kylo Ren take you." I cringed at the name Kylo. (Y/N) just sat there, staring at my eyes. Tears building up in her eyes. Before I knew it she was sobbing into my old hands, struggled to breath. "HE WILL PAY!!!" She screamed through her tears. She pulls at the restraints. "CAPTAIN KYLO! HE TOOK ME FROM MY FAMILY!!" (Y/N) let out a horrific battle cry and pulled the bindings straight off the table. "Please stop your going to hurt yourself!" I exclaimed trying to hold her back. (Y/N) was raged, beyond raged. She could not be tamed, and she swore she would get Captain Kylo back for his actions. ___________________________ (Kylo POV) "Captain Sir, we have news on (Y/N)" Hux said. I lifted my head up from my desk, my blood shot eyes starting at Hux. "Well spit it out!" I was starting to get impatient, I haven't seen my darling in five days. Hux jumped at my sudden raising of my voice. "The Ljus captured her." There was a long pause, I balled my hands up in fists and roared like an animal. "THEY TOOK MY ONLY BIT OF SUNSHINE!!" I slam my fists on the desk and scream more jumbled nonsense. "Sir, I'm pretty sure we can get her back." Hux says trying to get closer to me. "You know nothing HUX! LUKE IS HER FATHER! JUST- JUST GET OUT!" I scream at him as hot tears fall down my cheeks. I point to the door and Hux bows, then leaves. I sit on my bed thinking, I need to get (Y/N) back. I hang my head low, thinking of her, and all the good times we had, even the bad. I was stopped in those thoughts when I got a sudden plan. "I'll go get her, take her like I did years ago, I need her back." I stand, trying not to cry, and start to pack some small things. I decided not to go in my usual attire because it wasn't very movable and I could be easily spotted in blue red, and gold clothing. Sighing I grab my sword, and hand gun, for extra protecting. Luke is very powerful, and if he finds me I need anything I can get. ___________________________ When the ship was all asleep I snuck out to the deck to get into one of those small boats. We always kept some tethered to the side of the ship, in case of only a few crew members needed to go ashore. Crawling in one I set some food and water down on the floor under a bench and sat down. I cut the rope holding it in place. The little boat fell to the ocean with a massive splash, witch covered me in salty water. "GREAT!" I say sarcastically and took out an ore. Only a few minutes pass and my arms are already tiered from rowing. I sigh and set down the ore. I lay across the bottom of the boat, looking up at the massive stars and moon. I wonder what life outside of this planet is like? I wonder if anyone knows where (Y/N) is? I miss my father, I wonder if he misses me? Questions won't stop bombarding my mind, it hurts too much to think while the small boat rocks. The Stars put a soft warm glow on my face, making me feel comfy and at home, I feel actually welcomed for once. I was hated amongst the land, no one loved me. (Y/N) loved me, I'm pretty sure anyway, I mean why would she sleep with me? I sigh, no, she came cause I yelled her name and she wanted me to shut up so she could sleep. That's why she helped me sleep. I yelled and make my hands fists, pressing them into my eye sockets. "I don't even love myself, but I can't leave this life, Hux, Phasma, and Snoke will kill me. I'm the only reason we actually kill people and take over land. They'd be dead without me." I think long and hard about the last thing I said. They'd be dead without me. "I'd be dead without them..." A tear coldend by the air, slowly makes its way down my cheek. My eyelids feel like bricks, I can no longer keep them open to look at the beautiful stars. My eyes slowly close, before I can even think I'm fast asleep. ___________________________ Salty ocean water splashes on my face, making me jerk away. I cough viciously "Ahg... What the... Fuck." I say coughing breaking it up. The sun is out, shining and casting hot rays all over. Sitting up I yawn, stretching out my arms and back. "I wonder where I'm at." Looking around to my left and my right I see a small island. Flashbacks race through my head, I wince as some of them are not good. (Y/N) is here. A/N thank you for reading!!! Sorry for not updating in a while!!! Soundtrack: Colors of the wind - Pocahontas (YIS LOVE THIS TOO PERFECT FOR THIS STORY!) Eternity - idk the artist -Kylos Nose :) Chapter 6 : Chapter six A/N Ok don't watch the video unless you ship Kylux.... You might be scared... But I found this gem on YouTube along with MANY more Chapter 7 : Chapter Seven (Kylo POV) "W-What?" I say rubbing my eyes free of tears. "You heard me Kylo,I can never forgive you for this." She stood, leaving me on the floor, crying harder. "P-Please don't leave me..." I pleaded. "NO CAPTAIN! I have to..." She opened the door, many ship mates pooled in, surrounding me as (Y/N) stood in the doorway with her back to me. "Do with him what you will..." I was immediately scooped roughly off my feet, blackness starting to wash over me. ______________________________ I felt cold water on my face, I was suddenly jerked awake by a surge of coldness to my brain. I coughed violently "WHAT THE?!" I sit up quickly and place my hand on my throbbing, hurt head. "Get up, Ren." I hear Huxs voice. I look over to see him standing there, a scowl on his face. "What...?!" I say sarcastically. "You know exactly what! You didn't bring back our sailing master!" "I'm sorry Hux! It's not as easy as you may think!" "NO REN! YOU LET YOUR FEELINGS FOR HER GET IN THE WAY!" My eyes flared anger and rage as I flung my legs over the edge of the bed. "Supreme leader Snoke won't be happy about this at all! DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?! Kylo, get (Y/N) back here, NOW!" And with that Hux stormed out of the room, slamming the door. "Bastard, it's not as easy as I presumed..." Sighing I stand on my feet, letting the cold boards of the floor take my mind of her. I step out into the light, that the sun was casting through the window. I was alone in my quarters, no one there to bother me... Just me, myself, and I." Why do I have to go through this... I'd leave this life if I could. I sit down in my chair and slam my head into the oak wood desk, making it shake. "(Y/N) come back..." A/N I'm sorry for short chapter!!! I can't really think of anything till the plot picks up again!!! Thank you for reading!! -KylosNose
