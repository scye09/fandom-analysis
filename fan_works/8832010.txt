“Would the Lieutenant tell the General that the Knight is not talking to him?” Mitaka startles, and glances over at Kylo Ren. “S-sir?” “The General can hear just fine,” Hux snaps. “It’s the Knight who is being a big baby.” “Uhm…” “The Knight isn’t listening if the General is talking.” Okay, so he needs to relay that. “….I… General Hux said–” “HE HEARD ME PERFECTLY WELL, MITAKA, DO NOT INDULGE HIM.” “You’re my subordinate, so you do as I say,” Kylo snaps. “He’s not your subordinate, you’re not even in the ranks of the First Order, Ren!” “He still has to do what I say!” “He’s my officer, get your own. And no , I don’t mean any of mine. If you want to play stupid games, you can bring one of your Knights and he can talk to my Lieutenant.” “What about the Captain?” Mitaka tries not to hear any of this. He does so not want to get involved. “What about her?” Hux asks. “She’s in the Order.” “You’re the one saying you won’t talk to me .” “ You ironed my socks .” “ That is hardly the grounds for a lover’s tiff, Ren .” “ YOU IRONED MY BOXERS. THEY CHAFE.” “They look smarter!” Which is when the Captain arrives. “I prefer you both witho— oh. Lieutenant.” Mitaka hoped no one would see him backing out of the room. “Uhm…” “ Dismissed ,” Hux tells him. He runs away before he gets any more unwanted mental images. He doesn’t know how Captain Phasma copes.
