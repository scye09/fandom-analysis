I discovered that you are the best thing in the world. I have discovered that you are my favorite person, and nothing in the universe does me any better than your embrace. Your affection is everything I long for in life, and being on your side provokes the best feelings of all. And you're so beautiful ... Oh my God. You're wonderful and beautiful, just seeing you in my mind already makes me shiver. You are simply the one I love the most, with all my heart. Precisely because of this, I understood that I can not imprison you. Of course, keeping you in a pot and having you whole for me is an idea that sounds delicious. But I truly love you, and it is not healthy to do that. Like a beautiful bird, you should not be caged, but remain loose, free to fly and do whatever you want. I really want your singing, but you are free to choose what you want. Anyway, I just want you to be very happy. I'll always be here, like the old man waiting for the free bird to return to enjoy it, always wishing to have you by my side forever. I love you, prince. Be happy, wherever you are, with whoever you are, wherever you go. I will always carry you in the heart, as the best memory of my life, and as the greatest dream for the future. I love you so much. Until anytime you want
