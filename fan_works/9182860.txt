Her hair is done up in white ribbons, three enormously lopsided buns trailing down the back of her neck. Every inch of her is elegant, from the fine bones of her ankles to the very tips of her pointed ears. As Ben watches, she plucks a low-hanging fruit from the tree stretched above her, and takes a bite. Juice trails down her neck, the gauzy white fabric along her collarbone going damp and sticky. Just as he’s beginning to wonder if maybe he should stop spying and announce his presence, she turns towards his hiding place with a pointed glare. Says, “You might as well come out, you hideous mouth breather.” Her mouth is full of half-masticated fruit. Miniscule chunks of fruit and spittle spray every which way. Perhaps nymphs aren’t quite as elegant as the stories would have you believe.
