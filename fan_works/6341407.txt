Ever since Starkiller base, there was something different about Rey. She could feel it niggling at the back of her mind, but she couldn’t quite put a finger on it. It was a strange feeling, a sort of warmth that wrapped around her at night or when she was alone. At first she was alarmed, but as time passed, she was comforted by whatever it was. She chalked it up to the Force and her new connection to it. But when she got to Achto, she found out what it really was: a Force Bond, between her and Kylo Ren. Notes: Reylo Week deserves better. But I'm in a dry spell so all I can make are drabbles. Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 3 of the 100 word drabbles series Next Work → Part 1 of the Reylo Week 2016 series
