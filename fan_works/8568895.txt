“Kylo.” “Mnnnf.” “Don’t pretend you’re asleep.” “Hffmfn.” “You are - as you regularly remind me - several inches taller than me .” “…so?” “You can damn well cuddle me some times, you know?” “But you’re so good at it,” Kylo wheedles, turning to look over his shoulder, wiggling his butt back at Hux’s implacable side. He knows his rear is a source of great enjoyment for them both, and he is not above using it. “Please?” “I thought you wanted me to express my feelings and desires more frequently?” “…when they involve hugging me.” Kylo sighs. His ass does another dance, and gets slapped for it. “You can’t just pick and choose which desires I express, or even feel!” A snuff through his nostrils, and Kylo starts to roll. “Fine, if it matters that much to you–” “And don’t do it in a ‘I’m doing this badly so you don’t ask again’, way. You’re supposed to want to make me happy, too.” “I make you happy plenty.” “Blowjobs do not count.” “Blowjobs do count, and I will remind you of that next time you want one!” “Just fucking hug me already, you needy sack of shit,” Hux snaps out, and then immediately shows fear and horror in his eyes. Kylo lets him suffer for twelve whole seconds before he howls in laughter, and grabs the man in both arms, ruffling his knuckles through his hair and kissing at his neck. “Fine, fine. Come here, I’ll cuddle your bony ass.” “Oh, shut up.” But Hux is fighting his smile as he rolls around, and shoves said ass at him. It is bony. But it’s also still nice to curl up around.
