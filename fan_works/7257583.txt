His little brother sat on the edge of his cot, his head bowed. His impossibly fluffy hair hid his face, something their father often scolded him about. Today however, their father was lenient. Brendol approached his little brother, placing a hand on his shoulder. The last of the mourners had left their home, leaving the family to mourn the loss of their mother in peace. "Bren?" "I'm going to miss her," he whimpered, his lower lip trembling. Brendol sighed and sat down beside him, hugging him around his shoulders with one arm. He watched as fresh tears fell down his cheeks and he brushed them away. "I know but you'll always have her with you," he said. Been pouted a little at that with a snort. "Like how the priest says?" "No," he said. He smiled, poking a few of the freckles on his face. "Do you know what these are?" "Freckles?" "And each one is a kiss from mother from when you were first born." "Really?" "Really." He watched as his little brother's face lit up and he found that his own mood was raised at the sight. *** "Mother's freckles are becoming darker again," Techie noted. Hux snorted at that, smiling at him. "You've been outside more often. It's bound to happen." Techie smiled, poking his big brother's face with a finger. "Her kisses for you are standing out too," he said. He smiled, resting his forehead against his own.
