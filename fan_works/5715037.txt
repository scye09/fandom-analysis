The villagers never stood a chance. - FN-2187 raises his blaster – puts it to the Jedi’s forehead. “Stay out of my head, scum .” “Finn, it’s me ,” she says, there are tears in her eyes but FN-2187 isn’t moved – her lightsaber rolls away before Kylo Ren picks it up. “Good work, FN-2187,” he says. “You’re dismissed.” - The Jedi almost escapes. Almost. FN-2187 wipes blood from his lip and retrieves his helmet and his rifle – someone else will pick up her body. -x- FN-2187 has nightmares sometimes, but they’re vague – pushed to the back of his mind by his reconditioning. He hears screaming, smells smoke and oil and rotting flesh, feels humidity and heat and a too cold body sitting stiff in his arms. But when he wakes up – the nightmares fade quickly, and he’s left numb. Just how he likes it. -z- End. Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 43 of the author's fave series Next Work →
