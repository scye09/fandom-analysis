They had been checking out a rumoured First Order supply mission over Naboo and the ship had been shot down into the planet’s many oceans. “I’m working on it okay. This ship is not designed for travelling underwater and our engines are fried. I need to redirect the back-up power to the escape pod but once I do that the life support systems in here will fail. “And we won’t be able to breathe,” Finn sighed. “And we won’t be able to breathe,” Poe repeated, hitting the console. “Go stand by the pod. I can redirect it from here then run as long as you are in the pod with the door open then we can start the depressurisation and oxygenation before the two of us pass out,” Poe stated but he did not sound convinced. It worked. Finn thanked the maker every few seconds but it worked. They both sat on the floor of the pod as it jetted away from the still sinking ship. Poe was frantically gasping for air but they were both alive. “Isn’t it Naboo that has the giant fish?” Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 2 of the The Force Awakens One-Shots series Next Work →
