Somehow she's always in the middle of things. Their things. She's had more insight into their relationship than anyone ever, and knows things she never wanted to hear. Poe can be too frank. And while Finn can be more subdued — only not really — from time to time when it comes to Poe he's all smiles, and a never ending stream of sweet-nothing's and praise. They're equally ridiculous. But they're her friends, so she takes everything with a grain of sand. Or something like that, because she cares. Still, in moments like this when she's on the last bits of her patience, she can't begin to understand how she ended up with such friends. Much less how she was dragged along with them to choose furniture for their new apartment of all things. "I think red would be nice." "How about orange?" "How about you shut up and give me a kiss?" "Sounds good to me." They haven't stopped with the touching and the grins since they left their new house. And they're back to making out like they're the last people in the entire galaxy, it's quite the show. Rey has to smile awkwardly to every passerby giving them an odd look when they almost topple over a couch. She groans and wants to go back home already. She has important things to do, like tend to her ship. A rebellion to keep fighting for. She clears her throat with decision. "Sorry, do you think we could hurry this up?" They break apart, lips shiny and twin grins on their lips. "Yeah, sorry Rey, we just need to decide on a bed," Finn says. "A good sturdy one," Poe supplies. They're my friends. They're my friends , she reminds herself. They march on towards the aisle with the beds, and Rey takes it as a little victory. Only five minutes later they're back at it again.
