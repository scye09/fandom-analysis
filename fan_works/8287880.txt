His earliest memories are of Organa telling him about the Force. The all consuming power that flowed within all living things. From the moment Ben Solo took his first breath, his mother knew that he was strong in the Force. Stronger than her anything she ever felt before. Holding her infant son, she thought of the destruction of Alderaan, the evil of the Empire, and the fate of Anakin Skywalker. She kept these fears and secrets to herself. Ben Solo’s bedtime stories are about the mystical Jedi, the enigmatic Yoda, and the brave man who he was named after. Han Solo’s tales are less exciting. His father is a scoundrel and a cheat who was fortunate enough to be on the right side of history. Solo did not understand the Force. He did not fear his child as his wife and brother in law did. He dreamed of his son following him into the smuggling business, of gifting him the Millennium Falcon on his eighteenth birthday. Solo was as Force-sensitive as a rock. This caused tension in an already rocky marriage. He thought ignoring Ben’s growing powers and explosive temper would prevent the inevitable. Solo refused to accept that he was a bit player in the Skywalker family saga. Then there was Luke. Optimistic, foolish Luke Skywalker. He wanted to save Ben like he saved Anakin Skywalker. He wanted to rebuild the Jedi Order. Luke Skywalker wanted a lot of things he couldn’t have. When he stumbles upon Kylo Ren surrounded by the corpses of padawans he knows that history will repeat itself. He is powerless to stop it. There can be no Light without Darkness. It is the will of the Force. The Skywalkers and Solo defeated the Darkness. Kylo and his Knights of Ren will bring balance back to the Force. Ben Solo never stood a chance.
