He looks down at Hux, ruffles his too-sleek red hair while he thinks of hazel eyes and brown hair, more than a few strands out of place. Still, this is certainly one way to improve their working relationship. And of course Hux’s military precision extends even to blowjobs, his rhythm so regimented that Ren’s sure he’d hear the Imperial March if he probed the General’s mind. Hux doesn’t notice when he uses the Force to press against his own throat, not exactly, though Ren feels gloved fingers squeeze his thigh at that exact moment. Gasping for air, he wonders if she’d hold back like he is right now. He thinks back to when he had her in this chair, when they both felt it, something like a whimper escaping his lips. Or would she be reckless? He pushes harder. It feels good - good enough that his hips jerk upward, interrupting Hux’s own monotonous movements - but it’s not quite right . As his vision blurs, he can’t help but long for more, for the feeling of her skin against his, fingers closing around his throat… He releases just before his consciousness slips away, thrusting into the General’s mouth so that he’s almost choking. He almost smiles - there’s something amusing about Hux with saliva and semen dribbling down his chin, and then the man takes out an elaborately decorated handkerchief to clean himself up before struggling to stand. Ren can almost feel the pins and needles in his own legs. “Hux.” His eyes follow the other man’s face, but he’s not quite sure what it is he’s looking for. “Ren,” he nods curtly, and turns on his heel. “I’ll…see you later.” Ren smirks as the General shuts the door behind him. “Yes, I’m sure you will.” Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 4 of the Far Above the Moon series Next Work →
