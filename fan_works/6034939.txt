Everywhere Poe could feel Kylo Ren’s presence. He would be tinkering with his X-Wing and he could hear the thrum of a lightsaber from just over his shoulder. There was never anything there. Whenever he tried to sleep, the feeling of his mind being on fire returned with his mind tearing itself apart every hour of everyday. It started to effect his flying, he was unable to tell what was real anymore. He would see Kylo Ren on every battlefield he flew over until he stopped flying. Then the Knight of Ren became more vivid. He would appear behind Leia when he was in a debriefing. He would appear fighting Rey instead of Master Luke. Poe was losing his grip on reality slowly and painfully. Then his hallucinations started talking, telling him to fly away from here and hide on the outer rim. Telling him that he wasn’t worthy enough to fight for the Resistance. And Poe was starting to believe him.
