“Chirrut, I did not die to see these children make the same mistakes their elders, and not betters, did.” “Baze, my love, you didn’t die for a lot of things.” “I know.” “We can pretty much take it as a given that you didn’t die for nearly everything . Would it not be more meaningful to say what you did die for, instead?” “But I did die to stop a giant ball that shoots planets up. And this one shoots five. So I think it’s still relevant to the current situation.” “This is true,” Chirrut concedes. “You might even think that a ball that destroys one planet at a time was better than one that does five.” “Neither of them can be counted as ‘good’.” “…no, both are, indeed, bad. But one is less good than the other.” For a moment, they watch as the First Order engineers outline the schematics to the two men. One covered head to toe, the other in a coat that’s too big for him with murder on his mind. “Why do Skywalkers always ruin everything?” “He’s not a Skywalker, Baze.” “He might as well be. Are you arguing semantics over surnames with me?” “We might as well all have the same surname, if we came from the same first ancestors, then.” “That is not what I meant and you know it.” “Skywalkers do not just ruin things, they change them. That is what surrounds them, in the Force. An alteration, a new way.” “Not always for the better.” “No. But do not give up hope, not yet. There is always the potential for good, in everyone.” Baze shakes his head. “I’ve seen enough.” “Very well. I think the Force will surprise you, though.” “It always does.”
