"Homeboy is staring at you. AGAIN." Rey glanced up from her book, frowning slightly. She hated to be interrupted when she got to a good part. The two upper grades were crammed together in the auditorium for yet another boring assembly about college, and "choosing the right career path for you!" Personally she didn't want to think of any of this stuff for at least another year, so she had brought a book with her, spending the long hour going back and forth between reading and talking to the boy next to her, her best friend, Finn. She briefly locked eyes with the person in question; a tall, dark haired boy sitting about two rows to the side and beneath them. He was covered in head to toe black, with a baggy hooded sweatshirt, strap and chain-adorned pants, and clunky military-style boots, also decorated in straps. He hadn't always dressed like something out of an emo kid's wet dream. She had known him for years, as his family had lived in the house across the street from hers since grade school. When they were younger they were often forced (or as the grownups would call it, "encouraged") to play with one another, as their moms were good friends, and always at one another's houses. Then about two years back her mom passed away, and the visits from the Solo household became less and less frequent. Which wasn't due at all to lack of effort on /their/ part; but after her mom's death, her father became more and more of a social recluse, pushing away those once close to him and burying himself in his work. Their differing personal interests and groups of friends pulled them away from each other, resulting in a friendship that was more neighborly than actually friendly. Still, she texted with him quite often, and on rare occasions she also hung out with him in the outside world; platonic activities where they shared slightly common interests, such as food and movies. Despite the often scary black clothing and his carefully crafted cynical demeanor with others, he was actually a really nice guy. And, for some reason, it seemed like since the start of this year, his Senior and her Junior, he had been making more of an effort to talk to her, spend time with her. She couldn't imagine WHY; she was so different, probably dull, compared to the group of friends he normally hung out with. She had off-handedly mentioned this to Finn, one time when they were watching TV at her house. He jumped right away into the whole "Maybe he has a crush on you" spiel, and despite her protests, hadn't left the idea alone ever since. It wouldn't--be such a bad thing, if he DID see her like that. Which she doubted. It was just, she honestly didn't see what the attraction would be, on his end. Again, despite questionable fashion choices, he was actually quite good-looking. Tall and muscular, with tiny dark moles standing out against pale skin on his face and neck. Unusually full lips for a boy, and a full head of long, semi curly black hair that often fell in a messy tangle across his dark, expressive eyes. His name was Ben Solo, although, about three years back, he had started going by Kylo Ren, which he had informally christened himself around the same time he went into full-goth mode. With the exception of his parents and a few stuffy teachers, nobody ever called him by his /real/ name; she doubted that half the people in his life even knew what it /was/. He was sitting with his core group of friends, an eclectic trio who, like him, wore mostly black and went by singular, made-up names. The girl was tall, taller than Ren even, with short spiky blonde hair and multiple piercings in her ears and lip. She went by the name Phasma. One of the others, Ren's best friend, was a guy who went by the name of Hux. He was about shoulder length height to Ren, skinny and pale, with dark-framed glasses and bright orange-red hair. If Rey had to guess she'd say that, aside from Ren, he was the most intelligent one in that group. Certainly the quietest; or at least he was that way in public. Lastly, there was the other boy, about halfway in height between Ren and Hux, with straight brown hair, big ears, and a mouth that wouldn't quit. He had one of those annoying carrying voices, loud and somewhat nasal, that you could pretty much identify out of any group of people. He went by the name of Mitaka, although his friends had adopted to calling him Mitty on most occasions. She looked at Ren, now, who was indeed looking at her; and she raised her hand a little , wiggling her fingers at him in a slight wave which he returned, smiling tentatively, before turning back to the sketchbook sitting on his lap. She couldn't see very well what he was drawing from here, but it looked sort of like a dog or some small animal biting the head off of another, larger animal. Turning back to her book, she said to her best friend "He wasn't /staring/; he just happened to be looking in this direction, Finn." Finn snorted a laugh, leaning back further in his seat. "So he just 'happened' to be looking in this direction, like 5 separate times, now?" "Well, obviously that's not such a hard thing to do, if you've 'happened' to /see/ him looking over here all these times." "Touch√©", he said, grinning. "Hola, amigos", said a voice from behind them. Finn turned around, smiling widely; but Rey didn't have to turn around to know who is was. It was Poe, the guy who had moved here a little over a year ago from San Antonio; a startling attractive half-Latino boy with an adorable accent, curly brown hair, huge soulful eyes, and skin that stayed enviably tanned-looking even in the coldest winter months. And, most importantly, he was dating Finn. The first time that Finn had confessed to her that he had feelings for the charismatic newcomer, she had been somewhat surprised, but supportive. Finn had never shown interest in /anyone/ before, male or female, so she had assumed that there must be terribly special about the one person who had finally caught his eye, in that way. Eventually the two started dating, casually at first; and then earlier this semester they had declared themselves in love and exclusive with each other. It was somewhat awkward, in the beginning, trying to include Poe into a group that had been a duo for so long. However his charms and his obvious devotion to her best friend warmed Rey's heart to him, and now the three of them were nearly inseparable, spending copious amounts of time at each other's houses and hanging out. He walked up now, leaning across his boyfriend to give Rey a tight hug before pecking Finn on the cheek and slipping into the seat he had been saving for him. "So what's new in the land of boredom?", he asked, leaning back in his seat and frowning at the stage, where some representative from the local college was giving a speech about freshman enrollment. "You know, same old same old," Rey said, not looking up from her book. "What do YOU want to be when you grow up?", she asked in a mock-cheerful voice, imitating the speaker at the podium. Sitting up a little, he said "I don't know about the rest of these losers, but I'd like to be Mr. Finn one day", he said teasingly, reaching over to grab Finn's hand. Finn gave his hand a squeeze before saying "I think they mean something that'll earn money, babe. Something lucrative." "But it will earn money. I mean, at least YOU will. You're going to be a professional basketball player, right? You'll be making millions, and I'll get to be a stay at home spouse, with the kids. It's a good plan." Finn laughed, before saying "Yeah, okay; tell that to Coach Dickwad the next time he has me riding the bench the entire game." "Sounds like a smart plan to me, Poe", Rey says as she turned another page. "Well what about YOU, mamacita?", he asked, using the nickname he had assigned to her from the very beginning. "What do YOU want to be?" She frowned, looking up from her book at him. "Happy, mostly." "That's -- deep", Poe said, now looking at her thoughtfully. "That should be the answer everyone has; to be happy." "I suppose; but happiness doesn't pay the bills, in most scenarios", she said, yawning and stretching out a little. "Which is why we have to sit through bullshit assemblies like this one." Finn leaned forward, conspiratorially. "Well I know what would make you happy," he said, shifting his eyes down towards where Ren was sitting. "What's that?, asked Poe, confused. Right then the bell rang, dismissing the auditorium and saving Rey from having to answer Poe's question. Her heart sank as she heard Finn say to him, low, "Don't worry; I'll tell you later." Chapter 2 iMessage Tuesday 8:47 PM Finn: what's up bestie and bae? Poe: hey there sexy Poe: was just thinking of you Finn: yeah? why's that?

This was his fifth attempt at drawing the stupid self-portrait he had been assigned in Art, and for the life of him he couldn't figure out why it kept turning out so bad. He also didn't get why, when he was alone with his sketchbook, drawing came so easily to him. He could draw anything off the top of his head, and most of his stuff turned out pretty good. But whenever he had to draw something for an actual assignment-- He had thought that taking Art as his elective for the semester would be s breeze, as he spent most of his free time sketching out the pictures in his head, anyway. He quickly learned, however, that his work suffered greatly when it had to be drawn within the confines of school assignments and standards. It was too far into the year to drop out and take something else, so he just put his head down and plowed through, trying to make the best of the situation. Even if his class work was horse-shit compared to his actual work. Like now. He was almost temped to take out his phone and snap a picture of himself, to work off of, before telling himself how stupid of an idea that was. Why in the world do you need to look at a picture of your own face?, he thought angrily to himself. You've lived with it for 18 fucking years; do you not know what you look like, yet, or what? Frustrated, he sat up in his seat, looking around him. Most of the tables in the library were empty, except for a few kids scattered here and there at random tables, reading or talking quietly amongst themselves into the stillness. It was about an hour after the final bell, and most of the other kids had gone home. He was sitting in here waiting for Hux, who had a meeting down the hall with his creative writing club. Hux's car was in the shop, getting new brakes put on, and Ren had grudgingly offered him a ride home. He really shouldn't complain; before he had gotten his wheels Hux had driven him all over the place, without complaint. The least he could do was wait for him one lousy day, right? He turned back to his sketchbook, sighing again as he tried to make another attempt at drawing his face. No, fuck; now his ears were all wrong. Resisting the urge to scream, he crumpled the drawing up into a ball and tossed it beside the other balls, sitting on the table. At this rate he would have quite a collection before he left. He was staring down at the blank piece of paper, but found himself thinking of the assembly earlier. Mostly it was boring, but he was paying attention enough to hear the benefits of possibly going to community college for 2 years, before transferring to a "real" school. It was probably a smart option, considering that his grades weren't the best; and community college was an extremely cost-efficient way to build up both grades and transferable credits before going to the "big boy's school". Not that he particularly wanted to think of any of that now. He had been half paying attention, his eyes wandering around the auditorium, until they landed on Rey, his friend and across-the-street neighbor. He wasn't sure why, exactly, but lately she had been on his mind more than usual. They texted each other every so often, mostly lighthearted things like funny memes or amusing anecdotes about school. But he often found that, no matter how short or how goofy the conversation, he always wanted more. Like, he could go on talking to her forever. He had been thinking this when he was looking at her, not realizing he was staring until she caught his eye and smiled at him, giving him a little wave. She'd be easy to draw, he thought to himself, absently moving his pencil over the paper and beginning to sketch out the face in his mind. A pale, small-oval face framed by chin length dark hair. Tiny nose ending just above full lips. Semi-sculpted cheeks. A smile that crinkled her wide eyes and illuminated her whole face. "Hey, I'm ready, let's get out of here", Hux spoke behind him, causing him to jump a little in his seat. He hadn't even noticed him walk up. "What'r you working on?", he asked curiously, attempting to peek over Ren's hunched shoulders. "Self-portrait for art", Ren mumbled, curling his hand around the picture to hide it; too late. Hux had already seen. "I don't know, man, I don't think you look quite as pretty as that. Really NOTHING like that, at all. Do you want to borrow my glasses?", he asked teasingly, taking them off and holding them out to Ren. "Shut up, Hux", Ren growled, slamming the book closed and stuffing it into his backpack. He stood up and slung his bag over his shoulder, pushing in his chair as he said "Come on, let's get out of here already." The two boys walked through the empty hallways in silence, a bit, before Hux cleared his throat and said, somewhat awkwardly, "Was that--your neighbor?" Ren scowled at him and said nothing, as Hux continued "Because, if it was, it was good. Like, really really good. Very--lifelike." Ren shrugged his shoulders, still saying nothing, as they reached the parking lot and made it to his car. He unlocked the doors and got in, tossing his backpack in the back seat and cranking the key in the ignition. His stereo immediately started blaring out his old Black Sabbath CD, the last thing he had been listening to this morning. He winced, turning it down a little. They drove along in silence a little towards Hux's house, before he spoke again, in a low voice. "That girl--is really cute, Ren. At least, she is in the picture. Why don't you ask her out sometime?" "We do hang out sometimes," he mumbled, not looking at Hux. "Just last week we went to see that movie, remember?" "I know that, man. I don't mean like /that/. I mean like, an actual DATE." "She wouldn't want to for-real go out with me, Hux. I don't think I'm her type. Plus, you know, we're friends. Just friends." "Jesus Christ you're a jackass", says Hux, a smile in his voice. "Haven't you ever heard that the best relationships are ones that start off as friendships?" "No, I haven't, you dick", Ren said, smirking as he looked over at Hux. "If that's the case, why aren't WE going out, then?" "Because you're an ugly, ignorant fuck-face and I have standards. Idiot." Now both boys were howling with laughter, eyes tearing up and coughing into their hands. When they calmed down a bit, Ren looked back over at him, grinning. "I think you meant to say that I'M a drop dead sexy genius and you're a pale puny ginger numb-nuts." "Eh. To-may-toe, Tah-mah-toe." They pulled up in front of Hux's house and he got out, leaning back in the open window to say "Thanks for the ride, punk-ass. Text me later, huh?" "Yeah, yeah, yeah. See you later, loser", he said and pulled off, leaving Hux standing on the curb, still chuckling to himself. Chapter 4 iMessage Tuesday 11:03 PM Ren: so you dicks comin over or what? Ren: hello?

Ren: safer this way, trust me Rey: lol ok weirdo Rey: see u in 10 Ren: k Chapter 6 He pulled up in front of her house and jumped out, grinning. She was sitting on her front step, under the porch light. Her hair was pulled back into a messy bun, and she was wearing her dad's oversized Yale hoodie over a pair of pale pink pajama bottoms, black Converse shoes peaking out from underneath the hem. She looked absolutely gorgeous. He walked over to the passenger door, pulling it open and lowering his head in an exaggerated bow, moving his arm in a sweeping gesture. "Your chariot awaits, mi'lady", he said, smirking up at her from beneath the hair. She laughed and stood up, turning red as she said "You really do know how to go full dork-mode, don't you?" He laughed as she got in, saying "I'm nothing if not amusing." The ride to Coldstone was punctuated with more laughs, as they switched back and forth between various radio stations, arguing with each other's "taste" in music. Pulling up, Rey couldn't help but notice how crowded it was, for this time of night. It was only around 9pm, but still, for a school night that could be pretty late. They ordered their ice cream, Kylo getting an Oreo sundae and Rey getting a double chocolate waffle cone, before going to sit at one of the little tables by the window. She looked around the room. Lots of the people here seemed to be from school. As she focused on a large group sitting between two tables across the room, she recognized them as the school's drama club, probably just coming from rehearsals for the new play they were putting on. Oh, shit, she thought; if they're here, then that means . . . As if reading her thoughts, a tall curly headed brunette boy happened to glance up and meet her eyes, grinning in slow recognition. Then he looked to her left and saw Kylo, and his smile got even wider, his eyebrows going up with curiosity. Excusing himself to his friends, he stood up and headed across the room towards them, pushing a lock of hair out of his face with one hand and holding a sundae in the other. "Rey! Hi girl! What's going on?", he asked loudly, looking pointedly at Kylo through narrowed eyes. "Hey Poe", she said, standing up to hug him. "This is Kylo", she said, gesturing towards him with her head. "Hey. I'm Poe.", he said, extending his hand before pulling over a chair from the next table and flipping it around, sitting on it backwards. "What are ya'll doing out here so late?" Rey gave him a brief explanation of what they were doing there, before distracting him with a question about his groups play. He launched into a full diatribe of their rehearsal, gesturing with his hands and acting out a few of his favorite scenes for them with his spoon and a straw from the little dispenser on the table. Kylo was watching him and listening, polite but somewhat confusedly. Rey could understand that last part; Poe often came across quite strongly to those who didn't know him very well at first. His dynamic nature and sometimes exhaustive charisma could be hard to handle, at first. "Looks like my group is leaving", said Poe, tossing the remains of his sundae in a nearby trashcan. "I'll talk to you later, mamacita," he said as he leaned over to hug her again. "And it was nice to meet YOU," he said, nodding at Ren. Ren nodded back, watching as Poe left and walked towards his friends, looking back over his shoulder at Rey one last time. Oh, God, she thought to herself, Now I really AM never going to hear the end of this. "He's--interesting", said Kylo, absently scooping up the rapidly melting remains of his ice cream. "Yeah, he is," said Rey, nibbling the last bit of her cone and throwing the stub in the trash. "He's the one dating Finn now. You remember Finn, right?" Kylo nodded, wiping his mouth with the corner of his napkin and tearing the rest into tiny strips. "That's funny", he said, seemingly absorbed in his little task. "I never would have thought that Finn was . . . you know . . ." "Gay?" "Yeah", he said, looking at her tentatively. "Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's just, not something I would have pictured." "Well, truthfully, I don't believe he IS gay. Poe neither. Or anyone, for that matter", she said, glancing up at the confused look on his face before continuing. "Or I guess that's not what I mean. I mean, I don't think labels should be a thing anymore. People put so much emphasis on what other people are or aren't, and like, why should it even matter?" "I think you should love who you love, or like who you like, and just leave it at that. If you're a guy and you love a guy, fine. If you're a guy and love a girl, fine. What you do should have no effect on other people's lives, you know? But why's it so important to put a label on /everything/?" She stopped speaking, abruptly, looking at him to see what he thought of her impromptu rant. He probably thought she was a little crazy. He was looking at her with a thoughtful expression on his face, his brow furrowed slightly as if in thought. "I never really thought of it that way", he said slowly, running his hand through his hair. "But I see the point of what you're saying, and I think I agree. Labels ARE pointless and you SHOULD just love who you love, no matter what other people decide to /call/ it, or /say/ about it." "You're pretty smart," he said shyly, looking down at the table. "And you're pretty sweet", she said, timidly reaching across the table and grasping his hand in a brief tight squeeze before letting go. "For the ice cream, I mean. Very nice of you." "It's no problem," he mumbled, before standing up. "It's getting kinda late though; are you ready to go?" "Yeah, I'm ready." He held the door for her as they stepped out into the chilly night, each pursuing their own thoughts as they glided through the dark towards the car. ~*~*~*~*~*~ "Hey", she said, glancing around shyly at his friends before pulling a small brown bag out of her backpack. "I made these for you, this morning. A little thank you for the ice cream." He and Hux and Phasma had been sitting in their usual corner table in the cafeteria, when suddenly Rey walked up to them, seemingly materializing out of thin air. He wondered how she had gotten in; this wasn't her lunch period, and usually the lunch aides at the door would check the ID's of all unfamiliar faces to make that they belonged there. Now he took the bag, opening it and grinning. Inside was a handful of large, fluffy looking M&M cookies. "Geez this is nice of you. Thank you." Hux elbowed him in the side, and Ren jumped a little, clearing his throat before saying "Oh. This is Hux, and that's Phasma", he said, pointing to each one in turn. She smiled and said Hi to each of them, before looking back at Ren. Do you--want to join us? I can pull another chair over.", Ren asked, straightening up in his seat a little. "Thanks but no. I was just passing outside and saw you sitting here." "Besides I should probably get out of here before Godzilla over there realizes I snuck in.", she said, gesturing towards the burly lunch aide standing a few feet away from the door, chatting with one of the teachers. "That's cool. Well, thanks", he said, somewhat awkwardly, trying to control the blush he felt creeping over his face. "No problem", she said, turning to leave. "Let me know if you liked them later; if the secret poison doesn't get to you first", she teased. "It was nice to meet you both", she said to the other two at the table, smiling shyly. "You too", said Phasma, eyeing Ren before smiling back at the girl. Hux nodded and smiled, also looking at Ren. Phasma couldn't control the wide grin spreading over her face as she waited for Rey to be completely out of sight, before she pounced on Ren. "Geez, Ren, your face is so red right now", she teased, leaning across the table and flicking at his cheek with her fingers. "Shut up", he grumbled, flinching away from her hand and pulling his hood over his head. "Not sure but I think that girls in my Bio class", Hux said. "Like she sits in the back of the room. Wow, up close . . ." "Cute, right?" Phasma joined in, taking a sip of her Coke. "So tiny! Like a little doll!" "Yeah Ren you better be careful with her, you're liable to break her with your big self.", said Hux, leaning back in his chair and lacing his hands behind his head. "Hey guys, what's up?", asked Mitaka, coming over and plopping down next to Phasma, setting a large plate of fries and a Kit Kat bar in front of him. "What's wrong with you, Ren? You look like you're having a stroke or something." "Shut UP", he growled at him, grabbing his bag of cookies and pulling out the biggest one, scowling as he nibbled at it. "Who shoved a stick up /his/ ass?", Mitaka muttered, shoveling a fistful of fries into his mouth. "He's just a little embarassed because his ~girlfriend~ was here", Phasma cooed, stealing a handful of fries off his plate. "Girlfriend?", he asked, confused; then he said "Oh--you mean that one girl?" "Yeah, that one girl", said Hux, also leaning forward to steal fries from Mitaka. "Seriously though have you ever seen her up close? Really adorable." "No, I haven't", he said, as Ren glowered at them all from underneath his hood. "Isn't she with that one guy though? The one from the basketball team?" "No, she's NOT", snapped Ren, slouching back in his seat. "That's her /friend/." "Okay dude, calm down. Just asking, God." "So we still going to the play tonight?", asked Phasma, changing the subject. Mitaka groaned next to her. "I HATE these school plays," he said, opening up his candy bar. "They're so damn boring!" "So do I but if Mr. Rebar is offering extra credit for this, I can't NOT go. And you either, genius, not after you flunked that last quiz." "That quiz was bullshit, anyway. Like none of the questions were in the book!", he exclaimed, waving his candy bar around, tiny flecks of chocolate falling from the wrapper. Phasma rolled her eyes. "Yes they were you idiot. You'd know that if you actually /read/ the damn thing!" "All we've gotta do is go, right? And we get the extra points?" "See, this is why you keep failing. We also have to write a one-page review of the play, critiquing the actors 'n shit." "Seriously? That sounds like a lot of work. Aren't there just Cliffnotes or something I can copy? It's Hamlet, right?" "Yeah but you're not writing a review on the damn book; its on the play itself, the actors. Pay attention once in a while!" Mitaka pouted, balling up his candy wrapper and stuffing it into his empty water bottle. "Now I really /don't/ wanna go." "Well suck it up buttercup cuz you're /going/. So are these two weirdos. Not like /they/ have to. Hux actually loves these things." "I do. They're really good. And honestly it wouldn't kill you ignorant cretans to get a little bit of culture.", said Hux. "Wait so why am /I/ going, then?", Ren demanded, crumpling up the now-empty cookie bag and tossing it on top of Phasma's empty tray. "I don't need extra credit, and I don't like plays, either." "Peer pressure, bitch. We're going, you're going. Plus you're driving, so--" Ren frowned but said nothing, fiddling with the lid of his bottle of Sprite. Phasma watched him for a little bit, seemingly about to say something but then changed her mind, sighing a little. "I've gotta go; I have to get my art project out of my car and get it to class before the bell rings. Don't want it to get broken by some asshat in the hallway." She stood, walking across the room to dump the garbage on her tray before coming back and grabbing her backpack from the back of the chair. "Cmon Mitty, come help me carry it in, please?" "Fine," Mitaka huffed, standing and smoothing back his hair. "Later, D-bags", he said, tipping a nod back to Ren and Hux as he and Phasma made their way out the door. The two boys sat in silence a few minutes, each lost in their own thoughts, before Ren said, somewhat awkwardly, "I think--I really do like her, Hux." "Who?" "Who do you THINK?", Ren asked, sighing and rolling his eyes. There was another long pause before Hux said, in a serious voice, "So tell her." Ren ran a hand through his thick locks, chewing his lower lip before saying "I couldn't do that, Hux. I'm almost positive she doesn't like me, like that." " 'Doesn't like you' ?", Hux repeated, looking sideways at him. "Dude she MADE YOU COOKIES! If that's not "like", I don't want to know what /is/!" When Ren didn't respond, he looked over at him again and sighed, taking off his glasses and rubbing the lenses with the back of his shirt. "Look", he said, squinting as he readjusted his glasses back on his face, "What's the worst thing that could happen if you told her? I mean no matter what at least you wouldn't be sitting around wondering about it anymore, right?" "But at the same time," he continued, turning in his chair to face him, "If you DON'T say anything then you'll never know what could have happened. Always that what-if. And we're too young for what-ifs, man." "I'M too young for what-ifs, Hux", Ren said, a soft smile on his face. "But you're like 12 years older than me, so it should be fine for /you/." "ONE year, you ass", says Hux, smiling and punching Ren on the arm. "But anyways," he shrugged, growing serious again, "Think about what I said, and let me know if you need some help or something. I can be a great ice-breaker." Ren rolled his eyes at that, smirking. "Yeah I'm sure you can be, Hux. Thanks for the offer but I'll handle this myself, okay?" "Ok", Hux shrugged. "But if you change your mind. You know I only say this shit because I love you, right, Ren?" "Yes I know, weirdo. Geez why don't you say that a little louder, I don't think they heard you in the back." "I FUCKING LOVE YOU REN!", Hux screamed out, drawing several amused stares from around the cafeteria. "Ass", said Ren, before both boys burst out into hysterical, raucous laughter, clapping each other on the back as the bell rang, sending the room into scattered little groups all around them.

What are you doing here still?" Rey turned around, surprised to see Kylo standing behind her. It was about 2 weeks after their venture to Coldstone, and she hadn't seen much of him since then. It was growing late, getting on 5pm, and most of the students had gone home already. Finn was supposed to give her a ride home, but the coach had called an impromptu basketball practice and now he wouldn't be free for at least another hour. Rather than wait around, she had told him that she was just going to catch the city bus home. She gave him a hug and watched as he loped off towards the gym, duffle bag slung over one shoulder. Now she was standing between the two sets of glass doors to the school entrance, keeping watch on the bus stop across the street. It was too cold to stand outside so she picked this semi-heated vantage point instead, standing and idly watching the flow of traffic and random pedestrians hurrying by. She explained all this to Kylo now, who was listening to her with a concerned look on his face. "Is that really all you're wearing?", he asked, eyeing her. Rather than her normal heavy pea coat she was wearing leggings and a light-weight hooded sweatshirt that barely went past her waist. She shrugged and said, "Well like I said Finn was going to be my ride so I didn't think I needed anything heavy." Shaking his head, Kylo pulled his own leather trench coat off and held it out to her, ignoring her protests until she finally took it. It was, of course, HUGE on her, hanging all the way to her ankles and burying her tiny arms in its massive sleeves. But it was warm and comfortable and smelled good, /really/ good, so she was glad to have it. "Come on," he said, pushing open the heavy doors and gesturing for her to follow. "I'll give you a ride home; but on one condition." "Which is?" "Come hang out with me somewhere first." "Like--where?" "I don't know", he said, unlocking his car doors and climbing in, turning the key in the ignition and immediately cranking up the heat. "Somewhere. Anywhere." "Well---I was going to ask Finn to take me to that new record place on Terrance Street. Do you want to do that?" "You mean CD store?", he asked, confused. "No I mean /record/ store. It just opened like a month ago. Supposedly they sell actual /real/ records, like the old Vinyl ones. Supposed to be fairly cheap, too. Also I think stuff like VHS's, cassette tapes, old posters--things like that." "How have I not heard about this?! Okay let's go!", he said excitedly, pulling out of the parking lot and into the flow of late-afternoon traffic. When they pulled up to their destination, Rey was struck by how charming the place looked. It was a small dusty-brick building with a large front window and an overhanging sign with the words Sam's Records & Retro spelled out in neon bubble letters. The door was a blue velvet and glass revolving door, like in a hotel. Walking in was like stepping into a time machine. Rows and rows of different music genres and assorted movie bins lined the bright green floors, and the walls were decorated with a variety of framed posters depicting pin-up girls, muscle cars and a plethora of old movies and tv shows. A number of candles and incense sticks were placed along various small end-tables scattered throughout the store, smells of vanilla, jasmine and sandalwood blending into a seamless bouquet of fragrance. On a shelf behind the checkout counter sat an old record player slowly spinning out what sounded like "Me and Bobby McGhee". Rey wasn't really a Janis Joplin fan but the song did lend a pleasant atmosphere to the store. "Jeez, I feel like it's Christmas or something", Kylo said beside her, grinning excitedly as he headed off in the direction of the wall labeled 1980's Rock. Smiling, Rey walked around a bit, exploring different walls and containers until she came to a stack of old posters, labeled "2/$10; Buy 4 Get Fifth One FREE!" She sifted through the display, carefully turning each page and inspecting the artwork on each one. Kylo came up to her, his arms loaded down with a eclectic mix of records and VHS tapes, looking pleased with himself. "Wow, are you planning on buying out the store?", she asked, smiling at how happy he looked. "Rey there's no way I could pass up on this. Look!", he said, gesturing with his head towards an album wedged underneath his left arm. "It's Appetite for Destruction! I've always wanted one of the old vinyl records of this!" "You like Guns n Roses?", she asked, surprised. "That's interesting; I wouldn't think that 80's hair bands would be your thing." "Are you kidding? Those are like the best kinds of bands; back when rock was dangerous and exciting." "I'll take your word for it. I like Guns n Roses but if I had to pick any 80's Rock band it'd probably be Metallica. Old Metallica. You ever listen to songs from Ride The Lightning? Like, Fade to Black? Change your life." Kylo grinned, gesturing to the album wedged underneath his other arm. "Got it right here, actually." "Wow", she said, laughing a little. So it looks like we share some taste in really old music, but not current stuff? "Looks like it", he said, laughing as well. "What'd you find?" "Oh", she said, grinning. "I found 3 Bettie Page pinup posters I didn't have yet. She unrolled each one to show him, being careful not to rip the delicate aged material. "Huh. Those are really pretty", he said, as they headed towards the check out. "When would that be from? The 60's?" "50's, I think," she said as she pulled out her wallet to pay the girl behind the counter. "Bettie Page is like, my queen of the pin-up girls. She was so gorgeous." "I think it was the contrast", she went on, as Ren paid for his items, "Between the hair and the eyes. Like the bright blue highlighted by the dark hair. Different considering most pinups of her time were blondes." "Yeah, sometimes it's the different stuff that shines the brightest", said Kylo, as they thanked the cashier and headed back out into the darkening twilight of a late-fall afternoon. Back in the car, Kylo said, turning to her, "So is there anywhere else you want to go? Get something to eat, maybe?" "That's okay", she said as she buckled her seatbelt. "Unless--do you want to come over to my house, when we get back? Come keep me company? My dads gonna be working til like 10 tonight. We can--order Chinese? Or something?" "Yeah I'd like that!", he said quickly, eagerly. Then be blushed a bit as he mumbled "I mean, yeah, Chinese sounds awesome." Rey smiled down at her hands as they pulled out of the parking lot and back into the street. ~*~*~*~*~*~ The ride back to Rey's house was mostly silent. Kylo seemed to be lost in his own thoughts as he stared out at the road, answering her comments and questions with monosyllabic responses. When they got to their street, he pulled into his own driveway, saying it would make more sense to just park at home and walk across to her house. As Rey grabbed her bag, preparing to get out of the car, Kylo suddenly reached out and caught her arm, stopping her. "Wait." She turned back to look at him, slightly startled. "What's wrong?" He pulled back his hand and put both hands on his steering wheel, fidgeting a little. "Can I . . . talk to you?" It seemed as though all the color had drained from his face and he was fidgeting around harder than before, not looking at her as he spoke. Rey's heartbeat picked up a bit; he looked sick, what was wrong? "Of course", she said out-loud, hoping her steady tone of voice would help calm her own nerves. "You promise you won't like, laugh, or something?" "You know me better than that, Kylo," she said, frowning slightly. At first it didn't seem like he'd say anything else, as he continued to stare at the floor and restlessly pull at the strings of his hoodie. When he did start speaking, his voice was so low that she had to lean towards him, straining to hear. "Okay. Here's the thing: Rey, I um, I like you. Not just as a friend. I mean yes I like you as a friend; but I mean. More. A lot more. And I've been a chicken shit about telling you this for a long time but. Seriously. I've felt this way for what seems like forever. I don't think I can take not knowing anymore. Not knowing if . . . maybe? Maybe you might . . . like me, too?" Now he did look up at her, timidly, his eyes filled with a mix of hope and fear. Now it was Rey's turn to be silent, thinking of what he had just said. She couldn't sit there and say that this necessarily came as a surprise to her; not after that text from Hux and all the other subtle and not-so-subtle signs that had been there. Still, it was a shock to hear the words finally coming from his own mouth. There were a million things she was thinking, feeling, and she wasn't quite sure which one to address first. She snapped out of her reverie as she noticed Kylo was still staring at her with his big dark eyes, his anxiety practically bleeding out into the air as he waited for her response. So she slowly leaned over, carefully took his face between her hands, and gently pressed a kiss into his lips. And then a second one. And then his initial shock wore off and he was kissing her back, wrapping his long arms around her soft waist and pulling her in close. Finally they let go of each other and pulled back a bit, smiling at each other. Rey was about to say something when a splash of light from behind startled her. Twisting around, she saw her father's car pull into her driveway across the street, and she watched as he got out and trotted up the walk and into the still-dark house. "Shit! He's home early!", she said, pulling her stuff together. "I've got to go; he's going to wonder why I'm not home yet." "Wait", said Kylo, grabbing her arm again. "Do you . . . are we . . ." "Text me in like 15 min", she interrupted him, leaning over and giving his lips one last quick kiss before hopping out of the car, slamming the door behind her. Kylo continued to sit in his car for a few more minutes, in the dark, noticing how cold it was getting with the heater off . . . . . . but unable to stop smiling.
