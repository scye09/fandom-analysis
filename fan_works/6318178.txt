Kylo grabbed his wrist the moment Poe tried to move out of bed. "Babe," Poe sighed, "you need to eat. And drink." Kylo pouted, as if eating and drinking were superfluous luxuries. "Then ask the droids to deliver it to your room." Poe chuckled before bowing his head to kiss the back of Kylo's hand, causing his mate to sigh, eyelashes fluttering with pleasure. "This ain't the First Order babe. Can't spare resources on room service. I'll be back before you know it." Kylo grimaced and rolled over, turning his back to Poe, causing another chuckle to escape his lips. Poe pinched Kylo's side causing him to yelp and curl further away before he stood up to leave. "Brat." He said as he pushed the door open. "Jerkface." He heard just before it closed behind him.
