The two men lay on their backs next to each other, slightly sweaty, naked, and vunerable. Kylo's private quarters were always the farthest away from anyone else's, which made their small 'meetings' feel a little more safe and private. Kylo rolled to his side, facing the ginger man next to him. "Hux." he mumbled. "K- Ren," Hux sat up, pulling the thin blanket up with him. "I know what you're about to say, please don't. Not tonight." They don't look at each other. Kylo remained on his side, sighing a bit. "I don't know why we can't make it work, we can't even be friends-" "That's because we're not," Hux interrupted. "We're not friends. We're not boyfriends. A relationship in this environment couldn't- wouldn't last." He stated quietly, standing up to dress himself. Kylo almost felt as if that was more a reminder to himself rather than a reminder to Kylo. "Then what are we? What is this? Why do we do this?" Kylo snapped a bit, sitting up to look at the General. Hux didn't bother looking at him back, and instead finished getting dressed. It hurt. Why must he be so goddamn distant? "I... I don't know. But something keeps telling me that this should end. Goodnight, Ren." His response was calm, but it stung. It made Kylo feel a heaviness in his chest. With that, he left. The door hissed shut and Kylo Ren hadn't felt lonliness like this in a long time.
