“Millennium Falcon, you are clear to land. Rogue Squadron, please take two passes before attempting to land,” Aura said into her microphone. A blast of roaring reply came into the mic, as the pilots whooped and hollered after their victory. With a smirk on her lips, she pulled the headset away from her ear and spun around in her chair. “General Organa?” she asked, as the old war hero and legend turned towards her, dark circles beneath her eyes. “They’re back, ma’am.” Several yells of joy rang out and papers flew through the air as the control room filled with celebration. Aura stood up from her chair and wiped her forehead. It had been a long day--- a long week, actually. Now they were finally safe, and Star Killer base was no longer a threat. Closing her eyes, she sighed in relief. Then, a hand clapped down on her shoulder and she turned around to find Leia Organa smiling at her. Confused and shocked at the sudden tap, she stared into the woman’s tired blue eyes. There was happiness in them, but as Aura peered deeper, something dark, something hurt lurked in Organa’s irises. “Good work, Lieutenant.” The general gave a half-smile then walked away, as Aura was pulled into a hug by one of the other analysts. Warily, she watched her superior retreat from the room. Turning back around, she yelped as a bottle of Correllian Brandy was passed before her, and a glass full of the liquor was thrust into her hand. “For the Alliance!” someone called. Everyone in the circle lifted their glass to their lips and chugged down their drinks. Coughing, Aura pressed a hand to the center of her chest, as the whiskey burned its way down her gullet. The alcohol and all the stress she had been feeling, went straight to her head, and she leaned against a desk, setting her glass aside. The rest of the room swirled as more whoops rang out. Suddenly, warm hands snaked their way around her waist, and she let out a yelp. She leaned back against a hard chest, as a warm breath landed on the nape of her neck. “Hey, Aura.” a voice whispered in her ear. Turning around, she was greeted by bright eyes, blonde hair, and a happy-go-lucky smile. Without a word, hot lips crashed into hers and she let out a gasp as she pushed the young man away. “Kyle!” she hissed, looking around at the officers and other servicemen around them. The man laughed, and grabbed her hand, tugging her closer to him. “They’re busy,” he said, pulling her from the room. Glancing behind her, she saw that the room was indeed a chaotic celebration. Without a word, she closed the door behind her as they snuck out. ***************************************************************************** Bending down, Aura pulled her leggings on one leg at a time as the man in her bed watched her with eyes as blue as the Manaan seas. Kyle sat up on his elbows and quirked an eyebrow. “They don’t even know we’re gone. Come back to bed,” he murmured. Aura laughed. “Why, Lieutenant Mas, how unprofessional of you.” Pulling on her shirt, and leaving it completely unbuttoned, she sauntered over to him, her hips swaying back and forth provocatively. One hand threw her red hair over her shoulder, as she straddled his lap. A sharp, flirtatious grin spread across her face and she leaned down, gently pressing her lips against his. Kyle’s fingers followed the centerline of her body, grazing over her skin, sliding down between her alabaster breasts, before coming to a stop at her waist. The two of them broke apart as Kyle looked up at her. His blue eyes stared at her, and Aura stared back for a moment. He always looked at her like he was seeing through her. And just like always, it unnerved her. She tried to look down, to move out of his arms, but one hand held fast to her waist, as the other cupped her cheek. He forced her, gently, to look at him. “I love you,” he said, sounding so, so sure. Aura froze. He said it! Afraid, and unsure, her eyes stared down at him in shock. “Um…” She looked away. Kyle’s hand dropped from her face, falling to rest on her bare thigh. “Ummmm?” he asked raising an eyebrow. She looked back at him sheepishly, knowing what to say, but not having the strength to do it. “I---.” She cut herself off and stood up, pushing herself off of him, ready to flee. Her hands rose up and started buttoning up her shirt, in a frenzy. The bed creaked and a warm hand appeared, catching her wrist. She stopped. He hadn’t hurt her. He was gentle, always so gentle. Aura couldn't bear to look at him. So, she let her head tilt back, so she could look up at the ceiling. Closing her eyes, she turned around. “Kyle, I’m sorry, I just… I don’t know yet.” Her eyes opened and she stared at the door. Heart crushing silence filled the space between them. Slamming her eyes shut, she held her breath, waiting for him to speak, to say anything. “Okay,” he said. She whirled around in surprise. “Okay?” she asked, raising an eyebrow. Kyle nodded and looked over her head like he was peering into the future. “Okay,” he shrugged, “You’re not there yet.” Taking a step forward, he reached up and ran his hands down her shoulders, rubbing his palms against her arms. Aura looked into his eyes, seeing nothing but patience, and understanding… and love. “I can wait. I’m a very patient man, lieutenant.” He pressed his forehead against hers and she closed her eyes. “Okay,” she whispered back, as she leaned against him, sliding her own arms around him, holding onto him tightly. They stood in silence until an excited whoop came from the hall outside their door. Breaking apart, Aura looked over her shoulder, then back up at Kyle. Clearing her throat, she pushed herself away from him. “I need to get back,” she said. Picking up her boots she pulled one on, as she balanced on the other foot. “I’ll see you later?” “Sure.” She looked back at the man standing half-naked in the center of her room and blushed as she finished getting dressed. With a wry smile, she backed away and stopped by the door. “Maybe you should find some clothes, before Skal walks in?” Kyle crossed his arms and smirked playfully. “Like she wouldn’t love it.” Aura laughed full heartedly at that as she slipped out the door. Oh, Skal would definitely love it. **************************************************************************** In an Unknown System Kylo Ren knelt before the dark figure that sat on a throne above him. “Your failure has proven that you are still in need of training.” The young man looked up, his face covered in bandages. Long dark hair framed his face, as he took a deep breath, clearly in pain. “By the grace of your training, I will not make such a mistake again, my master." Supreme Leader Snoke leaned forward, his marred and disfigured face glowing in the starlight surrounding them. “See that you do not, Lord Ren. My mercy is not infinite. You will not receive a third chance.” Chapter 2 Aura sat down at her desk with a sigh. What happened…. Force, she was such an idiot. Come on! A guy says he loves you, and all you can come up with is “Um?” Shaking her head she turned to the side and set to work, as people trickled in and out of the control room. Aura was in the middle of computing attack percentages when a dull thud shook her desk, and she snapped her gaze to the side. A pile of paperwork sat on her desk as the control room sergeant walked by. The old man looked down at her with a scowl, knowing full well where she had been, but said nothing. Instead, he just continued his rounds. Understanding that this was a one-time only chance to make up for her earlier disappearance, she started working through the pile. Even though they were only a few hours into celebrating their victory over Star Killer base and the First Order, someone still had to make sure the Resistance’s flight command system was watched over. With grim determination, Aura took on that responsibility. “Hey, where were you?” Skal said behind her. Rolling her eyes, Aura spun around in her chair. Aura’s roommate, who also worked two desks down, was leaning through the door watching her. Skal was a little older than Aura, with blonde hair that she kept cropped short. The lieutenant glanced at her and shook her head. “Don’t ask.” Aura turned back to her computer screen and began to document the flight logs of Rogue Squadron. Footsteps sounded behind her, and she bit back on a groan as Skal sat down next to her. “So,” the blonde began, “I couldn’t help but notice that Lieutenant Mas went missing around the same time you did.” Aura shrugged. “Coincidence.” Skal pouted and crossed her arms. “Oh, come on, girl! I need some details!” Slamming a file down on the desk, Aura turned to Skal and spoke in a flat, dead, voice. “We went down on each other so hard we broke the bed.” The other girl’s face turned angry, as Aura turned back to her desk. “Is that the “detail” you were looking for?” she asked without losing her focus. The other analyst sidled up to her, leaning on the desk. “You’re no fun. You know that?” “That’s not what Kyle said,” Aura said in retort. “Ahem.” Both women sprung up and turned around. “General!” Skal exclaimed, as they both saluted their superior. Leia Organa waved them off and clasped her hands behind her back. “At ease,” she said. The old woman glanced at the computer screen behind Aura. “Why aren’t you at the celebration?” she asked. “I---,” the lieutenant began before the sergeant walked over. The grumpy old man’s eyes glared at the girls before he saluted Organa. “Lieutenant Keys and Kaffka are supposed to be documenting the flight logs and deaths of out fighter squadrons, ma’am.” General Organa frowned, “Don’t you think that can wait until tomorrow?” “But, General---,” the old man began. The Resistance leader held out her hand and cut him off without a word. Biting his tongue, he stepped away silently. She turned to Aura and Skal. “Go on, both of you. It’s been a long day.” Aura hesitated and looked at Skal, but the girl nodded her head towards the door as though to say, “Let’s get out before she changes her mind!” With a nod to the General, Aura followed behind the Skal, and they both ran from the room. Just as they reached the door, Aura glanced behind her to find the woman watching her. It was like General Organa was looking at a long lost child or a loved one. As she walked out the door, a chill settled over Aura’s shoulders, thick and wearing. *********************************************************************** “I can’t believe the old bat let us go,” Skal hissed as they walked down the corridor. Aura frowned. “She’s not that old.” She shook her head and stopped unable to shake the feeling that there was more to the General than what met the eye. The report of Han Solo’s death had made its way around the base, and they were close, married even, but there was more to it than that. The woman was in pain at more than just the loss of her husband. Something else was driving her, and how whatever it was that made her so willing to keep fighting made Aura even more curious. Skal stepped in front of her and waved a hand in her face, “Hey, what’s wrong?” She drew Aura from her thoughts as they rounded a corner. “Nothing,” Aura said pushing past her friend. “Girl, you’ve been acting like you’ve got a bantha stick shoved up your ass, ever since you came back from your little party with Kyle.” “I'm all right, Skal. It’s just---,” she turned and looked at the other girl. “What?” Aura shook her head and looked back down the hallway. She couldn’t bear listening to Skal’s badgering any longer. All she needed was a way to escape. Quietly, she moved her hand behind her back. “I think I left my ring on my desk.” She started back down the corridor without the other woman. “Oh,” Skal said looking back in the opposite direction, “Do you want me to come with you?” she called. Aura could hear dread of being asked to follow her evident in Skal’s voice. “It’s fine. I’ll see you later!” the girl called disappearing around the corner. Once Aura was out of sight, she leaned against the wall and sighed as she looked down at her hand. A silver ring glistened on her right ring finger. Skal’s footsteps disappeared, and Aura peeked out from around the corner. Skal was a good friend, Aura knew, but sometimes… sometimes she was too overbearing. Tilting her head to the side, she stretched up towards the ceiling and walked slowly back down the way she had come. Silently, she fidgeted with the ring. A sharp pain rushed through her head, and she gasped, collapsing against the wall. A voice echoed in her head, a face flashed before her eyes. Brown eyes, glimmering in starlight, stared down at her, “Don’t lose this. It’s all I have to give right now, but maybe---.” Aura froze and blinked her eyes as the face disappeared and she was back in the hallway. Her right hand pressed against the wall as she steadied herself. Just as the pain went, and she took a step forward, it came roaring back with a vengeance. “Hah-augh---,“ she gasped as she bent over pressing a hand to her forehead. “Not again.” “Ben, stop, this isn’t you---.” A voice screamed tearing through her mind and soul. “Aura? Aura can you hear me?” Dim lights flickered, and a hand caught her by the elbow as she stumbled. She looked up, “Huh? General?” Old blue eyes stared down at her, “Shhhhh, here sit down.” Leia helped her over to a bench silently. Aura sat down slowly, and bent over, pressing her palms to her temples. A soft groan escaped her as she fought against the familiar pain. Eventually, it began to fade. It was like a weight left her body, and she felt as though she was floating. With a thud, she leaned back against the wall and looked up, as Leia walked down the hall towards her quickly. “General?” The woman came back with a cup of water, “I think you can afford to call me Leia, lieutenant.” Aura took a sip of water and closed her eyes with a sigh. Then she set her hands on the bench and pushed. Slowly, she tried to stand, but the other woman sat her back down, “You’re not going anywhere for a while.” “I saw---,” Aura shook her head. Leia crouched down and looked up at her in concern, “What did you see?” The young woman stared down at her, “I don’t know.” She glanced down at her hand, and at the ring on her finger. Leia stared down at the ring and frowned. When she noticed Aura’s gaze, she cleared her throat and looked back up at her face. “You’re exhausted. It’s been a long day for all of us.” The general stood up, “Which way to your quarters?” Aura pointed down the hall in front of them, “Next to the cafeteria.” “All right then, let’s get you to bed.” Leia bent down and helped the girl to her feet. Slowly, they made their way down the hall. Aura tried to stand on her own but stumbled, and grabbed onto the wall as her legs gave out. “Watch out there,” General Organa said pulling her back up. “Here, hold on to my arm.” Weak, yet grateful, Aura did as she was told. The closer they got to her quarters, the louder the sounds of the celebrations going on in the cafeteria became. They passed it by, and Aura winced at the sound of whoops and hollers. With a sigh of relief, they finally made it to Aura’s room. “I think I can handle it from here,” she said. “Are you sure?” Leia asked. Aura nodded her head and started inside. Then she stopped, “General?” she glanced over her shoulder, leaning against the doorway. “Hmmm?” the war hero mumbled as she turned back around. "I heard about General Solo. I’m sorry.” Leia sighed and looked down, “Me too, lieutenant, me too.” With that, she turned on her heel and made her way silently down the corridor terribly alone. Aura let out a deep breath as she slipped inside the room. Exhaustion weighed on her body, and she flipped off the lights, before making her way through the darkness. Unable to keep her eyes open, she collapsed, face first on her bed. Dreams gave way to the reality, and she sank into a deep sleep. ************************************************************** Two dark shadows walked in the night, as thunder crashed overhead. “It’s the only way. You have to trust me.” Slowly, they came to a stop beneath a fabric canopy, clinging to one another “I do, but Ben---.” “I’m doing this for us. It’s the only way we can be together. I love you… So much.” “I love you too.” The taller of the two leans back and holds out a tiny ring of silver sparkling with each flash of lightning. “Don’t lose this. It’s all I have to give right now, but maybe---.” A soft sigh travels through the air. “Ben, I don’t need a ring.” “I know you don’t need it, but I want you to have it.” He slips the ring on her finger. “It’s a promise. No matter how far they drive us apart, I will always find you. You're the one, and you always will be Aura." Notes: Subscribe, kudos, and comment!
