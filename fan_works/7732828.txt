Something was off. Hux couldn't lay a finger on what exactly went wrong, he had done everything he usually did. He wined the lady, dined her – Rey, her name was Rey – and had spent an exceptionally entertaining evening. She was witty and funny. She laughed at his lame jokes and he hadn't even paid extra for that. When Hux realized they were the only guests left in the hotels restaurant, he thought wistfully that he had to take her upstairs now, or say goodbye. But he enjoyed her company far to much to let her go. She was sweet, and gorgeous, but it was her sweetness that really got to him, made him almost shy. She was there to get fucked, but Hux revered her. Made sure she enjoyed him as much as he enjoyed her. As his climax hit him, realization hit as well: For the first time in his life he was making love. Notes: So, hooker AU. I didn't tag it not to spoil the surprise. (It's so short, anyway.) I don't know where this came from. Bittersweet, onesided Reyux. Or is it?
