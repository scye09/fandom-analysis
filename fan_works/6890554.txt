Rey and Kylo Ren sit across from each other. "What are you doing here?" They don't know where here is, to be honest. They don't know what fanfiction is or why the fuck they're being shipped together. "What are YOU doing here?" He said, equally as confused and angry but that's because the fucker has anger issues. Rey rolled her eyes, so ready to kick the moody 30 year old's ass (y'all know he's 30 right???? like??? but right age doesn't matter, Rey will still kick his ass to oblivion). "Aren't you gay?" And moody and annoying, but she left that part out. "Aren't you ace?" It would fit in with her being alone forever and not needing anyone in her life to actually have meaning, but because he's a pissbaby, he doesn't think of that. Rey just get's up. "I'm leaving, this is stupid." BECAUSE REYLO IS STUPID. Also the epilogue is that Rey destroys Kylo and he goes crying to the orange jr hitler. THE END. Notes: i don't get you reylos
