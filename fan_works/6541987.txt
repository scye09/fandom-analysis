“It hurts ,” he moans. “The medical droids on the ship will take care of you,” Hux deadpans. Lord Kylo Ren admitting to pain is not something he’s used to, or something he knows how to react to. “I’m sorry,” he sighs. The wet feeling on his collar is no longer blood. “Keep it together, Ren,” Hux says, trying to come off dry and put-off, but he knows worry creeps in. Ren laughs, but it’s more of a sob against his throat. “If I don’t bleed dry before we reach the ship, Snoke will kill me himself.” His breath hitches and he sniffles. He’s right; even with his heart rate slowing, he’s still losing blood way too quickly. Hux is more than likely going to have to burn this coat. “I’m sorry about your coat,” Ren says, right on cue, still sniffling. Ren makes another choked laugh, and curls up closer to Hux in his arms. “Didn’t you once say you’d have my hide the next time I personally compromised a mission? Maybe I can be your new coat.” Hux’s stomach sinks. Ren’s hardly the joking type. He doesn’t really think he’s going to die for this, does he? Ren sniffles again, and his hand comes up to grab at Hux’s front. Even through his gloves, Hux can feel the desperation in his grip. “This went wrong.” “Shut up,” Hux says. It surprises himself, but it happens. Ren laughs again, that same awful, broken noise, and Hux nearly wants to drop him. This doesn’t feel like Ren, the metal-voiced brat whose terrible orders and dumb moves he’s had to tolerate and allow on his ship. He feels wrong, and heavier despite his blood loss. His identity crisis is melting snowflakes in the air. He’s practically gagging on it. “You’re fine,” he lies. Notes: did you know you can find me on tumblr ? : O
