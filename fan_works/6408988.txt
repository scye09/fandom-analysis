Prologue Everybody has one. No one questions asked, it’s just always been that way. At the spot where your head and your neck meets. It’s very small, and you can’t see it yourself. You normally can’t see others either because it is covered by their hair. We usually look at each others when we get drunk. We laugh about it, and we make up stories about how we’re going to meet them. Our soulmates. It’s all planned. Their initials are marked on the backs of our heads. If the letter is capitalized, it's a male. If not, female. Mine says F. It's a little strange. Everyone around me has got two initials. I'm a little worried about it. What if I don't have a significant other, and the letter is just an error? At the same time, I've got a feeling he's out there somewhere. He's a mould breaker. I just need to find him.
