A long, long, time ago, in a galaxy far, far away… The galaxy was saved. RESTART The galaxy was at war. RESTART It starts with a boy. His name is (Luke/Anakin/Jacen/Kylo/Ben/Obi-Wan/Finn/Poe/Han). He’s a hero. Except when he’s not. Then there’s a girl. Her name is (Leia/Padmé/Jaina/Rey/Siri/Mara/Satine/Ahsoka/Tenel-Ka/Allana/Tahiri) She’s the princess. Except when she’s not. They save the galaxy. Except- RESTART Or maybe it was the other way around. Maybe the girl was first. Maybe she was a (queen/senator/empress/jedi/pilot/historian/pacifist/warrior). She carried a (blaster/lightsaber/staff/nothing). Maybe the boy came next. Maybe he was a (slave/farmboy/smuggler/pilot/jedi/sith/stormtrooper/negotiator). He’s part of the (jedi order/rebellion/empire/sith order/nothing). They save the galaxy. Maybe- RESTART There’s two of them. (three/four/five/six...)

Together- RESTART They know this story. It was told to them by (parents/mentors/siblings/friends/acquaintances/strangers/the Force). The girl (headstrong/stubborn/brave/stupid/untried/jaded) starts it. Except when she doesn’t. The boy (naïve/wise/strong/weak/foolish/cunning/optimist) ends it. Except when he doesn’t. They save the galaxy. The story says- RESTART They’re on a mission. The (plans/queen/weapons/aid/knowledge/desperate hope) must be brought to (the Rebellion/the Senate/a ravaged planet/the clones/the New Republic/the Empire). They fly in (a junker/x-wing/fighter/diplomat’s ship/freighter). They’re (running out of time). They (only have one shot/one chance/one hope). They are (the last) of the (jedi/sith/planet/senate/rebellion/empire) They save the galaxy. They… RESTART They are… He is… She is… I am... They save the galaxy… RESTART There’s blood on her hands. There’s ash in his mouth. Sand is beneath their feet. (It always comes back to the desert.) They save the… RESTART There’s a weapon in his hand. There’s a word on her tongue. (It’s the other way around.) They save… RESTART They… RESTART They are… RESTART (They are always Skywalkers.) (Always) (Sometimes, the names aren’t important.) RESTART They save the galaxy.
