"Here take this, please." Y/N hands Kylo a pill ad a small cup of water. He raises an eyebrow. "Why?" "Well, it'll numb you up, so it won't hurt when I stitch you up. Or would you rather bleed out and die? Either one is fine with me." "Yeah, I'm sure it would be." He looks at them with an amused expression. He holds out his hand. Y/N putts the pill and cup and he takes it without a fuss. "Just get it over with." He lays back down and stares at the ceiling. "Sir, you need to remove your shirt." Y/N says in a monotone voice. "Anxious, are we?" He smirks, removing the black garment from his pale frame. Y/N shakes their head. "Not at all." They start. Kylo doesn't make a sound, and Y/N wasn't complaining. Once finished, they tap him on the shoulder. "Your side's done. I need to clean the wound on your face." He looks at Y/N and they look back, with a don't-fight-me-on-this-look. "Fine." Kylo whines as he sits up. Y/N says thank you and grabs a warm wash cloth. "This might sting a bit, but it'll be quick." "Then get started." Y/N places one hand on the right side of his face, while cleaning the left. Feeling the sting, Kylo hisses and latches his hand onto Y/N's arm. "You done yet?" "Yep!" Y/N sets the now slightly pink towel down. "I have some ointment for you, you'll need to apply it every night before you go to bed." They hand it to him, but not before applying some on his face. "Can I put my shirt back on, please?" "Whatever you want. I'll need to check up on it daily, so you'll need to-" "Really sweetheart?" Kylo sounds annoyed. "Yeah, well, sorry." He shakes his head. "S'fine." He mutters under his breath. "What was that?" I said it's fine. It's fine." Alright. Have a good night sir." Y/N replies. Kylo responds by waving his hand in the air and walking out.
