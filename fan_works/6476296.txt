Finn wakes up to Poe screaming. It's loud, and right in his ear, and normally Finn would complain but the sound is filled with so much terror and pain. “Poe!” Finn sits up and shakes Poe by his shoulders. Poe’s eyes are open wide and his body is stiff. “Poe!!” Finn says more harshly, and shakes him harder. He doesn't know what to do, he just wants Poe to wake up. This hasn't happened before. Awareness flickers into poses eyes before he lashes out at Finn with a harsh yell. Finn falls off their shared bed and hits the floor hard, but doesn't cry out. It's silent other than Poe’s rattling, heavy breaths. “Finn?” He says finally. Terrified eyes peer over the edge of the bed and down at the man on the floor. “You were screaming.” Finn says, as an answer to an unasked question. “Right it my ear. It was loud.” “I had a nightmare.” Poe whispers. He looks almost like a child, the lower half of his face hidden. “Do you wanna get back on the bed?” “Yeah.” Finn slowly stands up. He's probably going to have a bruise tomorrow. Poe moves over so Finn and comfortably lie down and wrap his body protectively around Poe. “Sorry for pushing you off the bed.” Poe whispers. “You were scared. It's okay.” “I had a nightmare.” Poe says again, and he pauses, like he wants to explain but isn't sure how to. “About Kylo Ren.” Finn hugs Poe tighter. “I'm here. He's never going to hurt you again as long as I'm here.” “Do you have nightmares too?” Poe’s voice is small. “Yeah.” Finn decides to go with that answer after a moment of silence. “Not screaming ones though. The kind where you wake up with tears running down your face.” “I'll protect you too, buddy.” Poe says. “We’ll protect each other.” Poe nods, and sometime later, falls asleep. Finn stays awake all night.
