Title: Shredded Fandom: Star Wars Characters: Hux/Kylo Ren (Matt the Radar Technician) Word Count: 100 Rating: PG-13 A/N: AU during the events of Star Wars: The Force Awakens Warnings: Force Choking Summary: Hux is not happy with Kylo being on Undercover Boss . "You're the 'Commander of the First Order'? I don't remember you getting a promotion." Hux glares at the figure sprawled on his bed. "And since when do you know anything about being a Radar Technician, 'Matt'?" The word barely leaves Hux's tongue when an invisible vise tightens around his throat. "You're just angry it took so long to see through my disguise, Hux." The grip vanishes as suddenly as it appeared, making Hux gasp for air. His lips curl back into something more snarl than smile. "Just for that, I'm going to trace your 'eight-pack' with my teeth." "Promises, promises."
