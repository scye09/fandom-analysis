Kayla was a reckless driver and Armitagia was originally nervous, but so far there were no hiccups of any kind. Even Kayla's road rage seemed like a distant memory.

Kayla teased as she got off the freeway. Armitagia shrugged. "I know it'll add an hour to our trip, but as long as I'm with you I don't care." Kayla smiled and Armitagia felt like the luckiest girl in the world. Notes: That was so fluffy. Ha! I hoped you liked it! Don't be afraid to talk to me on tumblr! oforlikelalune.tumblr.com
