The man I replaced is living happily on Coruscant; the Dark Side has excellent retirement benefits. It allows the name and the reputation to be passed on. No one would tremble before the Dark Lord Ben Solo ." "And therefore the mask," Rey said. "Yes," Ren agreed. "The Knights handle the details of the switch, but Kylo Ren always chooses his replacement. I would like you to be mine."
