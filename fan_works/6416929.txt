Hux was sitting at his desk and working when he heard the panel that led into his little brother's room slide open. He paused in his writing, mentally counting to five. When the silence continued he sighed and turned to look over to see the other standing on the doorway, his lizard hugged to his chest. "Yes?" "...I thought you were asleep," Techie mumbled into the top of his pet's head. "I have no time for sleep these days. I am busy ensuring that there is lasting order in all of the galaxies." "Oh..." "What do you need?" he asked. Techie hesitated a moment before gesturing to his ysalamir. "She had a nightmare." "She had a nightmare," Hux repeated. "When she has nightmares she feels better when we lie down on your bed," Techie explained. Hux gave his brother a look but nodded. "Then I suppose you will have to lie with her on my bed," he noted. He watched in mild fondness as the younger Hux went and laid down under the covers, his lizard grunting before settling down again. "Good night." "...Brendol?" "Yes?" "I think...I think she would fall asleep faster if you laid down with us." "Really?" "Like from before the Academy..." Hux found that he could not deny his brother anything. Knowing that he would not be getting anymore work done, he got up from his desk and shrugged out of his work clothes, pulling on a pair of regulation sweatpants and a tank top before climbing into bed behind Techie. "I wonder how this can help her if she was only hatched a year ago," he hummed, hugging the other. "She's special." "I'm sure she is." They laid like that for some time, Hux on top of the sheets with his brother under them. It was not until Techie's breathing had slowed and become steady that Hux slipped out of bed and went back to his desk to finish his work.
