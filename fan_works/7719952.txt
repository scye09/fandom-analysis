Operation Torch, the British-American invasion of occupied French Morocco and Algeria, landed its Western Taskforce at Port Lyautey on November 8, 1942, at first light. They did not anticipate Vichy French resistance and had no preliminary strike, which backfired on the American forces in one of their first battles of World War Two. Intel on the area from Ren√© Malevergne confirmed Port Lyautey to be one of the strongest Nazi-sympathetic regions in all of Morocco. Private Finnegan Warley was no longer sure where the line between prudence and cowardice lay. On the one hand, he had a duty to his regiment to do his damnedest to find them again and stand by them in the fight. On the other, he shouldn't take any foolish risks in trying to get back, especially with no navigation equipment in enemy territory. Or at least, he assumed this was still enemy territory. Could he have walked that far, into Spanish Morocco? This certainly wasn't the beach anymore. He'd come so far now that he had no idea where he was. The roaring of the storm had hailed upon Finn's ears in a way so like the gunfire, and the sound of either or both had set his feet to matching the pace of his thumping heart. Through the darkness, he could not make out the identities of the forms around him running, or the felled ones he tripped over... It was light now, and he did not run, but walked. He had not stopped once. The gun strapped to his back rattled dully with each step, full up with bullets in a way Finn wished his stomach could be with food, more than Finn had ever wished anything before. More than he wished he could have escaped boot camp, or destroyed his draft card--he could have eaten his draft card then, and been happy with the crisp, inky flavor. There was nothing for him but desert, desert, desert and hours, hours, hours. The desert of deserting: if they ever found him again here, he would almost certainly be sent to the very front for his un-patriotic attitude. Finnegan Warley kept walking.
