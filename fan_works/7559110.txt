Phasma knows she should probably keep her distance from the girl, but she couldn’t help feeling a little sorry for her, the girl was wide-eyed and nervy, completely different from any other woman she had met. Jessika had watched Phasma with wide-eyes, cursing that she had crashed, that she had been found by this woman. All the same, there was something oddly hypnotic about the woman’s pacing. She wished she didn’t feel it, but she did. Phasma eventually stilled, staring at her. Something was forming between them, both of them could sense it. The feeling of love terrified them both.
