“Is that my jacket?” Poe asks, recognizing the familiar fabric on the man who saved his life. “Uh yeah,” Finn says, staring to take it off. “No keep it,” Poe stops him. “It suits you.” Finn grins wide and Poe takes his chance. “You know what else suits you?” Poe asks with a wide smirk. Finn looks at him with slight confusion. Poe grabs his wrist and leads him behind one of the nearby spacecrafts. “This,” Poe says as he pulls the jacket that was once his down and kisses Finn hard on the lip. Finn, at first shocked, doesn’t react but then he closes his eyes and kisses Poe back. He smiles into their lips, wanting to kiss the pilot ever since he named him.
