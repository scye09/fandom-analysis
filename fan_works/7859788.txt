Matt. Matt. I’m Matt. He’d had too much to drink and he’d almost taken his glasses off when they got to Hux’s quarters, almost managed to forget he was wearing a wig. He wasn’t sure if it had stopped itching or if he’d stopped noticing. It didn’t really matter. I’m Matt. There was nothing special about the General’s quarters, and he’d already looked at everything worth looking at long before Hux returned with two glasses. I probably shouldn’t drink any more. He downed it. “Do you often do this?” For a moment the question seemed to catch Hux off-guard. “Do what? ” “This!” He laughed, gesturing at nothing in particular and almost knocking a lamp over. He definitely shouldn’t have had any more to drink. It just looked to him like Hux was… smiling. “No,” he replied, smoothing his hair before moving closer. “Most people aren’t so…forward. Especially not newly recruited radar technicians.” Ren- Matt leaned forward so that their lips were almost touching. “For some reason, I feel like I’ve known you longer than two weeks.” This time he felt Hux’s lips curl into a smile. Shit. “What an odd thing to say.” I can fix this. I’m Matt. I can fix this. By the time he’d figured out what to say, Hux’s tongue was already sliding between his lips.
