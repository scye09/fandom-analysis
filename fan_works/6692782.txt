Finn looked at the way Poe's cheeks burned a dull red whenever they held hands. He smiled a little to himself, watching as this occurred over and over again. Finally he forced himself to speak up, "Poe?" "Hm?" "Why do you get flustered whenever we hold hands?" He watched the pilot's eyes widen and he laughed. "Did you think I wouldn't notice it?" "...I've never had a boyfriend before," Poe mumbled. "Never?" "I never really had time for one to be honest," Poe explained with a shrug. "I mean I don't know how you..." "I've had lovers before, Poe." "Say what?" Finn snorted and rolled his eyes. "People always assume I'm inexperienced," he said. "Just because I was a Stormtrooper, that doesn't mean I don't know about certain interactions!" Poe's blush deepened. "I'm sorry." The other just smiled and kissed him on the lips. "It's fine," he promised. "I wonder though...what would happen if I held both of your hands?" he teased. The pilot threw his head back and laughed.
