Meeting the Babies Matt blinked and watched as Techie cooed, dipping a hand into the tank and swirling it around. The odd looking…creatures inside started to squeak and screech, chasing after Techie’s fingers in delight. “I thought I was meeting your nieces and nephews?” Techie looked up and smiled, gesturing once more to the tank. “Here they are! Aren’t they beautiful?” he asked. “…these..?” “My mother wasn’t Human.” “Ah…” Matt’s eyes flicked back to the tank and he watched as one of them nibbled on Techie’s index finger. “Your brother..?” “Gave birth, yes.” “Oh…” Chapter 2 : Valentine's “Brother?” “Yes, brother?” A crystalline box filled to the brim with various sweets was set down in front of Lune. He gasped in delight, clapping his hands together as he looked up at his twin. “Oh! You remembered! And I have a gift for you as well!” Another box was presented, a single bloody heart nestled inside with tissue paper. “For you!” Chapter 3 : Wisteria “My nephews tell me that they have entrusted you with the security of the space around Haven now,” Techie said as the woman approached, looking up at her to meet her eyes. “I’ll also be in charge of training the ground forces for defense should air ever fail,” Wisteria nodded. Techie frowned at that. “These people are former slaves.” “So am I.” “They came here to avoid violence.” “Violence isn’t going to avoid them because they ask it to nicely,” she countered. Techie blushed but fell silent, watching as she walked away. He placed a hand over his chest, wondering why his heart had begun to race so much.
