Cute outfit Those bow ties are like, the cherry topping on a sundae of being irresistible. *** Cuddles The first thing Finn notices upon awakening is the arm curled about his shoulder, and he doesn't even need to guess who it is as he wordlessly returns the gesture and both breathe in relief. *** Smile Jensen awakes with one hell of a hangover headache and half his face burrowed in the pillow, but when he opens his eyes and remembered who was lying beside him with a sleepy and content smile, he can forget about the ache for a moment and give a little smile himself. *** Mischevious cat Every dinnertime is the same routine, that chubby white furball hopping from chair to counter to stool in hopes to trip you up and get some of those juicy noms for himself, but he always purrs in the knowledge that he's happily spoiled and in a loving home.
