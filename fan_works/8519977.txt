Bet "Wanna bet?" Kylo puffed. Snoke rolled his eyes. "There is no way our dear General will say yes." Kylo huffed, "Of course he will! He adores me, of course he'll agree to marry me!" - Hux knew something was going to go horribly wrong when Kylo stalked up to him while he was in the middle of the bridge. The knight looked tense, based on the stiffness of his shoulders and his clenched fist. Honestly, if he pulled out his lightsaber Hux knew his long fear that Kylo would execute him out of nowhere would be finally coming true. "General!" "What is it, Ren?" Everyone on the bridge was staring, trying to seem like they weren't, but definitely were. "I want you to marry me." Everyone visibly stared. Hux went red, "E-excuse me?" "I said, I want you to marry me. You know, marriage, us being legally wedded." "Absolutely not! Get off of my bridge!" Kylo reluctantly sulked away. - "...He said no, Master." Kylo's voice dripped with misery. Snoke was oblivious to his pupil's heartbreak. "Send over the credits, apprentice. I'm going to buy a new robe." "Yes, Master." "I told you he wouldn't. He doesn't realize you have an attachment to him. Now you've lost." "Argh, don't rub it in!"
