Short Introduction || foreshadow I've got to get out of here, all my friends are dead (I think), and I'm scared. That...that masked man killed all my friends, but I don't know what to do now. Its going to be okay, but deep down I don't believe that at all. Oh my god, he's coming, he's coming. I gotta get out of here!
