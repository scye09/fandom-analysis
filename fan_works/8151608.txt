The Girl With The Fiery Spirit By the time Bazine Netal reached eleven she barely ever heard her full name. The villagers called her Bazzy, Curls, or Missy Pearl. Almost a nickname a day earned for the girl with the sunny disposition shucking her oysters at the harbor. A little cheeky slip of a water nymph used to rewarding affection laid at her dainty brown feet with a beaming smile. It seemed that there wasn’t a person alive who couldn’t be charmed by her easy going amusement, her infectious good mood. Watching those bright green eyes crinkle to near tears over a silly joke could make a grown man feel a little bit better about the world, and playing up her strengths she’d giggle extra hard if you bought five oysters. A snort if you purchased an even dozen. At the end of the day the leggy girl would always idly stroll back home, rose pink hair whipping in the wind while she counted up the earned coins. “Twenty, twenty-five, thirty...” “How much is enough to leave?” she’d ask herself on the last silver, sighing while looking out towards the pearl green sea. Always living with one foot pointed towards the future, but content for now to keep from tripping before she reached home. Having earned her daily bread for her family she’d sleep well and loved on a planet thousands of miles away from conflict. _____________________________________________ By age sixteen Bazine hadn’t left her seaside village. Always up at dawn you’d find her combing the beach for the best shells. A little touch of beauty before work. Admiring the luminescent objects for simply being themselves without demanding they serve a purpose. No flashy pearls or tasty meat needed to find their value. Good enough as is. Having shot up in height the year before she'd now sit her lanky form on rocks when selling her oysters. Legs crossed primly at the ankles, but a natural wildness still delightfully present in her freckled dusted cheeks and her honey hued skin. An island girl through and through. “Two coin!” she’d shout, flashing a smile. “What a steal, what a steal.” Two coins they’d give her, unable to deny her anything. “Have a lemon, it’ll make them go down easier.” she’d laugh, tempting the crowd with a toss of her curls. “Only one coin.” “And what else can we get to help you go down easier?” a bold youth once slyly asked. “A new face wouldn’t hurt.” she’d quipped, pocketing change into her billowing skirt as the crowd roared over poor Peter’s talking down to. Kicking at the ground he’d stormed away, but luckily Bazine’s smile proved too winsome for any man to resist for longer than a day. Back he’d return for another oyster, and with a wink she’d make him buy three. It hadn’t gone without her noticing that over the year the crowds circling her rock had grown significantly more masculine. Something different pulsed between them now as shell met palm, but Bazine wasn’t particularly worried. Sure, the men might have leered longer when given change, but earning her pay was worth putting up with more suggestive jokes. After all, the clever girl would happily take all she could before leaving the planet one day. What was the harm in making as much in the meantime? When it came to pursuing her dreams nothing much had changed over the years. The drive to explore still kept Bazine looking out towards the horizon, but now on the way home from work the teen no longer dawdled. The rumbling cough that her ma had developed over the fall hastened Bazine's steps to return before dark, forever mindful that somebody had to make soup for Pa and Lisabetta. Yes, the slightly less carefree girl unfortunately worked doubly hard that year to help their little farm skim by, but still she tucked away a couple coins for herself each day. Gazing out at the moonlit sea with a promise to cross it one day. __________________________________________ By age eighteen Bazine had been proposed to three times. The first unromantic offer took her off guard, the second made her laugh, and the third left her uncomfortable around the portly village minister. Determined to soon leave her world alone she’d politely declined the requests. Letting the men down easy with the excuse of needing to take care of her family bought her more time, but the grumblings from her neighbors turned Bazine more cautious with every refusal. Desperation had a nasty habit of converting even the kindest man into savage, and on her walks home she clutched her shawl tighter. Averting her eyes. Flirting less as she wasn't immune to the gossip growing louder in the streets claiming that war was finally knocking at her galaxy’s door. Little by little a fear had slowly entered into their pleasant island life over the past year as fewer aliens journeyed into their harbors for trading. Nothing was certain and safe anymore, and father began openly suggesting that she’d best not refuse every man before running out of options. In a hundred years he’d seen fertile dreams dry up before. When rockets light up the sky he’d witnessed women abandoned by their dead mates before ultimately being taken away to offer their soil for far less desirable seed. With all his heart the burly father couldn’t stand the idea of his sweet Bazzy-girl going through life without one great love before the carnage, but the headstrong teen was too idealistic to hear it. Never realizing that she’d didn’t have years left at home, only days. ____________________________________________ On her nineteenth birthday Bazine woke up to the sky roaring. Booming crashes shook her bed of the slats, and scrambling up from the splintered floor she couldn’t see anything, couldn’t stand. Too much hot soot falling into her eyes faster than she could wipe it away left her uselessly clawing at the air. Staggering to the door as the ringing in her ears deafened her own screams. Better perhaps without her ears as she couldn’t hear little Lisabetta caught up in the flames. Thankful later without eyes able to see her parents charred remains when she'd stepped over them. ________________________________________ One by one the troops rounded up the survivors. The men in metal suits lined up the solemn faced by height against the only remaining structure not smoldering as panicked voices raised. The hysteria building as more and more cried out to know what was happening. "What have we done wrong?" "What happens next?" "Have you seen my child?" No replies were offered. No mercy shown as up above the TIE fighters circled their menacing red glow across the fields. Hunting down the rest of the villagers they were merciless, but nothing inspired more fear than another brightest crimson light cutting through the night. True, it might have taken a hundred men to kill all of Bazine’s dreams in one evening, but one stalked forward to take more. Barking out his commands the crowd thinned further. In the blink of an eye gone was Mabel from the fish markets thanks to a blaster shot to the head. Gone next fell Peter before he could unleash an insult. Gone with no importance given followed the only village doctor with a hissing wound to the gut. At last, gone with a shout dropped the elderly shopkeeper standing beside Bazine. Without a head anymore he stood no chance of pleading his case, but Bazine didn’t flinch when blood misted across her cheeks. No fear shown as she faced death how she’d faced life. A smile on her face asking for something more. “Keep her.” she heard a mechanical voice command, and before Bazine could catch up to what was happening a hand clasped her arm. Without further explanation she was forcefully tugged away from the crowds dropping faster than the flies that would feast on them in the morning. Fumbling over her steps she stared back at her friends for as long as possible with a lone glimmer of hope unfurling inside of her before she ended up roughly thrown into the home she knew to be the Mayor’s. All alone at the end of a bed she waited for hours before eventually getting up to clean off her grey-tinged skin in the bathroom sink. Going through the motions of normality she followed her nighttime ritual. Soaping and softly singing to herself before the numbing shock finally melted away- all at once unable to avoid the truth any longer when her fingers caught in her slightly charred locks. The once lush soft curls stuck to her sooty palm, but thankfully Bazine was too worn out to process the damage to her vanity. It served me long enough. Staring at the gold speckled wallpaper she shut off the rational part of her brain whispering to her that her family was gone. Holding out instead on the foolish hope that she’d simply not seen them yet she made practical lists to pass the hours. First counting up all the places in her home where she’d hidden her money over the years; then torturing herself by counting up how many different ways she wished she'd have spent the money on her sister instead of selfishly hoarding it all this time. The baby of the family deserved new ribbons she’d never touch. The little girl would look lovely in the yellow dress she’d admired only the day before. Perhaps I’ll get it to her yet. _________________________________________________ Blinking herself awake, Bazine suddenly gasped. Holding in that breath before exhaling with a loud shudder as remembrance of everything hit her like a boulder to the gut. “You’re lovely when you sleep.” Dropping the sheets, Bazine’s head snapped towards the handsome man seated at the dining room table. Calmly pouring himself some tea in the best china he gave the impression that he owned the place. Hazel eyes warmly welcoming her good morning as his full lips curled up to a smile, but the infamous silver and black mask on table gave him away. This wasn’t a friendly lodger, this was the man who’d carved him up for fun. “W-what am I doing here?” Bazine whimpered. “Sleeping.” he blew lightly across his tea. “W-what are you going to do to me?” Raking his gaze from her toes to her head he lingered before taking a contradictory polite sip. “Put you to work.” “I have a job.” “And what do you do, beauty?” “I sell oysters.” Shaking his head, he chuckled. “None will grow here now.” “That’s not true.” Bazine snapped louder than expected, agitated by his control when everything around her spun away from logic. Everything good lost to his whims. "You're a liar." “Open the curtains then, and call me a liar again.” Sitting up on her knees, Bazine reluctantly followed his instructions. Her lip stubbornly jutting out as she fully expected to prove the man wrong, but when the curtains parted her mouth dropped in horror. No reply adequate enough to describe the devastating view of the now lava black sea. An unnatural churning in the waters wrenched her intestines into the tightest knots imaginable. Sickening poor Bazine where she sat as it dawned on her that the only skill set she’d ever possessed had instantly turned useless overnight. She had nothing. “I can’t...how can...how can that be?” “Your village didn’t pay up on its debts, but I’d say you’re just about square now.” “Why did you do this?” Swishing tea across his tongue, he thoughtfully looked her over. Weighing his response for the best possible outcome, and only setting the cup down when he’d pinpointed a solid read on his practical adversary. “I follow orders. It isn’t personal.” Biting down on her lip, Bazine tasted iron then. Barely containing her fury she shook, and the only thing keeping the usually gentle girl from scratching his eyes out was the saber resting beside the man in black- the light he hid behind shielding him even when powered down. An uncomfortable pregnant pause ticked away between the two strangers as she contemplated murder, and he casually poured himself another cup of tea. The calculated control driving home his absolute power as Bazine shrunk into feeling painfully small in his presence. Truly helpless in the world without anything to keep her safe besides what had always gotten her by. “Why did you spare me?” Frowning into his cup, Kylo murmured, “I couldn’t bear to destroy you.” Let’s keep it that way then. Standing up from the bed with grim determination she peeled off her thin night dress. Ending all conversation with a simple drop of cloth as the man’s pupils dilated his irises into nothing more than pitch black rings. A sharp inhale was all he could manage when Bazine’s desirable form shivered nearly naked in the middle of the bedroom. Every inch of her growing bold to scared to ripe for the plucking before his eyes. Vulnerable with such delicate fingers positively trembling at the top of the silk covering her knees when he held up his hand. “Leave the stockings.” Notes: I love Bazine more than I should...although that's probably hard to believe as you follow her upcoming descent. It's gonna get messy, but I hope you enjoyed the first chapter! Love to know what you think. -Bunny PS: She's not actually a mythical nymph.
