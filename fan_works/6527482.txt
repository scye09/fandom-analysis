This could be the most stupid thing you've ever read. And I regret nothing . This idea struck me while I was watching Adam Driver's clips at SNL and while I was scrolling Emo Kylo Ren's Twitter profile. SO, I thought: what could possibly happen if Kylo ran his own Facebook account? What other people what say in the comments? What issues he could talk about? And what about his parents and relatives? Well... this is it. It's complete nonsense and I love it. Also, I'm open to suggestions for any AU you'd like to see, if you have any particular idea! Since this doesn't follow any plot or similar things, I'll update as soon as I come up with something. Hopefully stupid. P.S.: I took inspiration for the Leia/Han comments from Mamalaz's gifset of "The Modern Adventures of Han & Ben"
