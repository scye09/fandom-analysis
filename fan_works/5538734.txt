She had complained about how often Finn liked to hold her hand whenever they were in danger to the elderly man sitting next to her at Maz Katana's new cantina. "River always does this to me, too." The man continued. "I've gotten us out of scrapes all the time!" She understood 'River' to mean the man's wife. "And it's not like we need any handholding, really!" Rey agreed. "Because we can handle ourselves just fine." Rey and the man laughed; they had said that last bit at the same time. "Rey," Rey introduced herself. "The Doctor," the old man grinned.
