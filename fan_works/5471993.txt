Finn was still asleep. He hadn't woken up and Poe found himself worrying about the ex-trooper. He spent his freetime sitting next to Finn's bed, talking to him. He knew it didn't help Finn in any way but it made him feel better. Sometimes BB-8 came to infirmary with Poe. It bleeped worryingly, asking Poe if he was surely all right. "I will be, someday", Poe assured the droid. BB-8 wasn't exactly pleased with the answer. "[Stop talking as if he is not going to wake up! You are the most optimistic human I know!]" it bleeped and whirred and buzzed. "[Try to find a way to wake him up sooner!]" "Why bother? I can't find anything!" Poe sighed in despair. BB-8 made an irritated noise and zapped Poe. "[Snap out of it!]" "Ow! That hurt! Why're you so pissed?" "[Because your expression is exactly the same that general Organa had when Han Solo died. Do not even try to tell me otherwise, I am not stupid.]" BB-8 beeped. Poe shifted nervously in his seat. "What do you mean?" Poe stuttered. BB-8 made a movement that could have been taken as an eyeroll. "[Are you stupid? Friend Poe, are you stupid? I am observant enough to know that you are fond of friend Finn.]" "Y'know, I'm important pilot. I don't have time for tha- Ow!" BB-8 zapped him again. It bleeped few curse words and rolled out leaving Poe with hurting leg.
