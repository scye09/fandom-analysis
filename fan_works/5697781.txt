Ever since he spilled it, he had been all over Finn. Ar first, Finn thought it was cute, but soon after, it had become a problem. "But I wanna cuddle you, Finn," Poe stretched out his words in a bratty way. "No, we have to go to the magic store, and get your spell lifted." Finn snapped, and Poe shook his head. "No, I don't want to be normal. Because I love you!" Poe shouted as he was trying to get on top of Finn. "Get off me, Poe!" Chapter 2 : 2 Chapter by zistysfosgerald "Come on, Poe. Get off!" Finn snapped, trying to get his boyfriend off of him. "No, Finn. I want to cuddle forever, baby," Poe moaned obnoxiously, and Finn struggled to get him off.

Finn lied, and Poe jumped up off the bed. "Okay, I'm excited!"
