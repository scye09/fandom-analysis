The sun was always a furious light The moon, always the reciprocate one It should not be a wonder that they fight Yet such a wonder that the moon won The sun was always a scorching fever Meant to bring goodness and eternal life Though its destructive nature brought neither Rather creating a burning and strife The sun was always a burning fire Still it’s one weakness, a mere satellite Though dim, the moon couldn’t help but admire For it knew what she had long since hid inside The sun was always a radiant glare But her name put his brilliance to shame And so the sky he continued to share As he watched to see what she had became The sun was always a flamboyant gleam And the moon was still its greatest downfall For the silent moon was wondrous to him And of him, she saw every tragic flaw The moon was always a beautiful might But the sun, it was always blind to why She was the dawn and she was the twilight But it was the sun that set her up high The moon was always an independent soul She could stand her ground and could stand her own But the sun showed her the meaning of home And gave her something she had never known The moon was always a gorgeous marble She had so much to offer to the world Things that the biggest dreamers would even marvel Things that made the sun’s stomach twirled in knots The moon was always a breath-taking stone The darkness that she was intrigued the sun They knew they had grown old of being alone But still that nothing could truly be done The moon was always a solitary beauty She did so much more than mirror the sun’s rays Her grace distracting the sun’s foremost duty You can tell by the way the sun never stays Notes: Thanks for reading!
