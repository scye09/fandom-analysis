Day 15 - Gingerbread Hux hates Christmas, especially when Ben is waving a gingerbread man in his face. He knows it’s coming. He can see it from a mile off. “Hux looks it’s you!” “Fuck off Ben.” Ben is in hysterics, laughing in his face. Phasma walks up to join them at their table in the canteen. “Oh look Hux, you have a twin” Phasma says it so dryly, it sends Ben further into hysterics. “Right. Fuck you two, I’m off” Phasma blows him a kiss and a wink as he storms up and out of the canteen. Ben bites the gingerbread man’s head off with vigor. Hux just grumbles under his breath. “I hate fucking Christmas.” Notes: Title is paraphrased from Alanis Morissette's The Couch The full line is - "you say his interjecting was him just calling me on my shit?" which I feel is appropriate for Hux/Kylo.
