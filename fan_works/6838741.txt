The Giant Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) He looks lost the very moment he bursts in through the door, dressed far too immaculately for a lazy Sunday. He kinda looks startled, glancing back at the door and forth into the bustling diner, as if he’s trying to figure out whether he wants to go or stay. It’s Rey who first notices him. He’s tall. Like a giant. She finds that amusing. A quick scan at the front counter; ol’ Maz is nowhere to be seen. But Rey can hear her, raising hell out back at Grumpy Unkar, the short order cook. Third time this morning. So it’s also Rey who calls out to the Giant over the idle hum and clink-scrape of the late morning breakfast rush. “Table for one?” Well, that seems to settle it for him. Realizing he’s been seen, the Giant offers her a small answering nod, and begins to pull at the burgundy scarf around his neck. Rey points him to ‘the shitty table’, the wobbly one that resists being leveled. It’s crammed in the corner, directly under an ancient, long-dead, wall-mounted television. She’s loathe to use it but, thanks to gentrification and yelp, it happens to be the very last table in Maz’s Cantina. The great Maz didn’t like the sudden influx of wealthy, fashionable millennials - they were driving away her decidedly roughhewn regulars - her kind of people. ( Brunch? What on this great green earth is brunch? ) “Take a seat there, I’ll be right with you.” Rey plucks up one of the few old, yellowed menus from between an oblivious couple and tucks it under her elbow. Then, with a glass of water in one hand, a pot of drip coffee ( it’s the only kind of coffee we got, thank you very much ) in the other, she navigates her way between crowded spaces. By now, he’s sitting hunched over in a chair, his long legs bent weirdly under the table to avoid knocking his knees. A giant in a clown car. Nevertheless, he mumbles a thank you for the coffee and Rey offers him a brilliant smile, before setting the menu down in front of him. “I’ll be back in a moment.” “Oh…ok.” Table four and five needs another refill, table three is wondering if they might – perhaps - have anything else that’s vegan – you know – off the menu, table two wants to pay their check, and another group date has just drifted in from the chilly late-autumn morning. “Those are our only vegan-friendly options, sorry…Oh, just go up to the front counter, I’ll sort you out in a second…Hello there! Give me two seconds, I’ll set you guys up right here...” It’s only when she spots the Giant again, tucked away behind the half-wall, that she remembers him at all. Well, he did get ‘the shitty table.’ She pins up two slips on the order wheel, pings the bell, ignores the ongoing drama in the kitchen and hurries back towards his table, order pad and pen drawn. He’s still staring intently at the menu. “Sorry about the wait, sweetie - what’ll it be?” He glances up at her for a brief moment. She’s offering him a smile as an apology. He seems momentarily flustered, before staring back at the menu spread open in his hands. “Oh…uh, the corned beef hash. Please.” “Did you want toast, home fries or pancakes?” “Pancakes. Blueberry.” “Sure thing!” “...and home fries, too.” “Ok! How would you like your eggs?” “Scrambled.” He pauses for a split second. “I would like two extra eggs.” She looks up at him from her order pad. His eyes are still glued to the menu. “So you want four eggs - in total?” He is chewing his bottom lip, his brows drawn tight as if the question was actually difficult. “Uh…better make it six - in total.” “Six?” “Six.” “Six.” She mutters under her breath as she scribbles it down quickly. “But can you leave out five yolks?” Her pen pauses over the order pad for a second, then she shrugs. Grumpy Unkar won’t like it, but at least he’s not asking for something ‘raw vegan.’ “Six egg scramble, only one yolk…” He’s nodding. “…and three rashers of turkey bacon, two turkey sausages, a cinnamon roll, a fruit bowl, two grapefruit halves, a glass of orange juice… actually, make that three – no – four turkey sausages …” She’s starting to think he’ll never finish ordering. She’s almost right. “…Oh, and a large oatmeal… extra cinnamon, no raisins.” “Three or four?” She jokes. He looks up from the menu with a kinda cute, earnest, befuddled look on his face. “No…just one.” She shrugs again. Maybe he’s a little slow. “…And one large oatmeal. Anything else?” He looks back at the menu, flipping it over in his hands. His mouth opens, closes, before he shakes his head, and hands her the menu.“No. That’s it.” “Thank you.” He adds. His earnestness is just a tiny bit adorable. She can’t be bothered repeating his order back to him. So she just gives him another smile instead. She thinks she can see him blushing. ==================================================== Table five has been wiped down and new diners have been seated by the time the Giant’s breakfast is ready. It takes her two trips and a struggle to fit everything on the tiny table. He tries to help, shuffling plates and bowls around ineffectually as she’s setting them down. As she finally manages to balance his fruit bowl precariously among his plates of sausages and eggs and corned beef hash, he offers another quiet thank you. “You’re welcome, sweetie. Enjoy!” She can’t help but stare as he immediately begins to slather most of his breakfast in pancake syrup, with unnecessarily intense focus. She hides her grin by turning away. ==================================================== Everywhere she goes, from her tables, to the front counter, to the kitchen, she can hear the slow clack-clack-clacking of ‘the shitty table’ as it wobbles while the Giant eats. He doesn’t look up from his steadily diminishing mountain of food. But she’s looking at him. She watches his jaw muscles clench as he chews, slowly and methodically. With every few bites, she can see him slowly set down his knife and fork to bring up a paper napkin and carefully wipe at his mouth. He gets annoyed when his long, dark hair falls over his forehead, and he has to stop more than once to tuck the offending strand behind one of his ears. His has pretty big ears. Or big pretty ears. She’s watching the Giant sip at a steaming spoonful of oatmeal when she’s jolted by an elbow nudge. It’s Finn, and he’s pointing. Her attention follows his finger to an irate soccer mom in her section waving a cup at her. Oh, right. That’s why she’s holding the coffee pot. “I’ll be right there!” She beams. She makes sure to check that the Giant’s still good for coffee, too. He’s got a fleck of oatmeal on his bottom lip. He doesn’t bother with the napkin – he runs his tongue along it instead. ==================================================== The morning rush ebbed into the pre-lunch lull. Poe had come and gone through the kitchen with Maz to go to the bank. ( Show me how this ATM deposit works, boy. ) Grumpy Unkar is slurping coffee - and a splash of something harder, probably - at the bar while chuckling at the funnies. Finn is checking and refilling the condiments and the napkin dispensers. She’s with one of the regulars who’s just wandered in, when she hears the scrape of a chair, a loud bang and a faint “owwww… fuck” from the Giant’s corner. He’s bent over and rubbing vigorously at his knee. She smiles as glances at him over her order pad, briefly ignoring her regular umming and ahhing in front of her. It’s almost as if he felt her staring; because he’s look up to meet her eye. He has the same startled look on his face that he had when he first burst in through the door. Then, he is smiling back. A tiny upward tug of his lip. Her customer huffs loudly, apparently they have given up. “I’ll just have the usual again, Rey.” “Sure thing!” Rey tucks her order book back into her apron, and yells across to Grumpy Unkar. “Grumpy! Usual for Nelson!” Unkar is grumbling as he heaves himself up and back into the kitchen. By now, the Giant is standing at the front counter, with his wallet is opened and ready in his large hands. Rey smooths her apron, offering him another smile as she settles herself in front of a pin up board. “Did you enjoy your meal?” He offers a mumbled reply. Grabbing his order receipt, she slides it in front of him. “That comes to thirty-eight dollars and ten cents, thank you!” He actually looks at the loopy scrawls as if he can decipher it. Nodding to himself, he pulls out two bills from his wallet. He lays down a fifty-dollar bill. Then another one. Rey cocks her head. It’s her turn to be confused now. But for the first time, he holds her with a steady gaze and his little smile is back on his lips. His eyes are just a dark as his hair. She can feel herself blushing. “Thank you. Keep the change.” Was his voice always that deep? She watches him as drapes his scarf around his neck, and stride purposefully towards the great, olive-green door. He braces himself, before pulling it open. A sudden gust swirls autumn red in. His hair buffets in the wind and he buries his chin deeper in the up-turned lapel of his coat. Then, the Giant is gone. Notes: This is my first ever fic, please be nice! Chapter 2 : Sunday Night Chinese Food Their tiny two-bedroom apartment is exploding with cardboard boxes. Some emptied, some untouched, all hopeless strewn. It’s giving Rey a headache to be honest. The master of the mess doesn’t seem concerned, though. He’s sitting on the couch, next to her, gaping like a fish out of water. “He left you a sixty-dollar tip?” Poe’s mouth hangs open. She can see his half-chewed mouthful of pretzels. Gross. If she didn’t like him so much... “Uh huh.” “That’s it. You’re paying for dinner tonight. I vote pizza. Hey, did you hear that, Finn?” Poe’s practically shouting now, towards Finn’s opened bedroom. “Rey got a sixty-dollar tip. She’s paying for dinner.” Finn peeks his head out into the living room, a pen tucked behind his ear, smirking. “Peanut,” he drawls at Rey, “are you talking about the BFG again ?” “BFG?” Poe asks. Rey is rolling her eyes. “Big fugly giant.” Finn barely gets the phrase out when he begins to chuckle. He ducks his head back inside his room. Poe’s hand flies to his mouth in feigned horror. “Oh. My. God. He’s a big fugly giant?” Rey groans, shakes her head. She loves Finn, dearly. But the man has two modes – sweetheart and super bitch. BFG was a product of the super bitch. “No. He wasn’t fugly. He was actually kinda cute.” Poe let’s out a long accusatory “oooooooh! Rey’s in love with the BFG! She wants to breed a tribe of BFG babies! She wants…Hey, hey, HEY!” Rey’s pelting him with pretzels. Poe valiantly tries to defend himself with a flattened, ragged cushion. Rey eventually relents. But only because she likes pretzels. “Anyway, how did it go with Maz today?” Poe doesn’t drop the cushion. He grins. “I see what you did there. Real subtle. Bravo. Well, ol’ Maz didn’t trust the ATM, so she made me double do a recount before I deposited the cash. Pretty much out in the open.” “That’s… remarkably unsafe.” Poe agrees with vigorous nods as he digs around in the opened bag of pretzels between them. He grabs a small handful, and pops a couple into his mouth, crunching them before he continues. “Yeah, I explained that to her. I also explained that humans were far more likely to count wrong than an ATM. She yelled at me. Last time I’m doing her a favor.” Finn’s apparently given up trying to study. He’s wandered out of his bedroom and is now leaning against the back of the couch, directly behind Poe. He’s running his fingers along the grain of Poe’s impressive stubble. Poe gives a purr of approval. Rey muses as she chews. “Maz is the product of another era.” Poe chuckles. “Yeah. Jurassic. I swear, that woman is a thousand years old.” Before an indignant Rey can respond, Finn’s already slapped the back of Poe’s head. “Be nice, Poe!” “Or what, honey-bun? You’re gonna spank me again? Yes, sir, please.” Poe is straining his head back against the couch. He reached up to tug Finn down by the front of his t-shirt. The two grown men descend quickly into giggles and sickly sweet, pecking kisses. Rey lets out a loud groan. “Oh, come on you two! Get a room already.” Finn just can’t stop grinning. “Oh, Peanut, we’ve already got one.” Rey buries her head in her hands. Finn quickly plants one last big one on Poe’s forehead before he straightens up, ruffling Rey’s hair on the way to the bathroom. Poe has a dopey smile on his face as he watches Finn’s departure. As the bathroom door closes, he seems to snap out of it. “Speaking of rooms.” He fixes Rey with a suddenly serious stare. He’s almost whispering. “Are you sure you’re ok with me moving in? I mean, I know you and Finn are really tight. I don’t want you to feel like you’re being left out…?” Rey cocks her head. “Why would I mind? I love Finn, Finn loves you, we’re friends...” “Best friends.” Poe interjects. “Best friends.” Rey agrees. “I really don’t see a problem.” Poe lets out a long sigh. “Thank god, you’re ok with this. I just thought… never mind. I swear, I will follow the rules. Finn’s already gone through the list with me. Always leave the toilet seat down?” “Yep.” “Even though there are now more men living in this apartment than women?” “Yep.” “Ok. Now that’s sorted. Let’s go get some pizza. Hey, Finn!” Poe’s shouting at the direction of the bathroom door. Rey’s laughing behind her hand. “Let’s go get some pizza! I’m hungry for sausage and pepperoni! Hurry up! Mrs Money-bags is paying!” Muffled by the bathroom door, Finn’s voice still manages to ring clear. “You’re always hungry for sausage!” Rey falls off the couch laughing. ==================================================== In the end, it was Poe who insisted that they go dutch. They don’t end up getting take-out, as they’d planned. They also don’t end up getting the pizza that Poe swore he was absolutely dying for. Instead, they’re eating Chinese food at the usual place, because Finn had a sudden, insatiable craving for egg rolls, lo mein and bright red sweet and sour pork. Rey finds herself being seated again at the same old hideous yellow formica table, under whirring white fluorescent lights, listening to the same old compilation piano mix being played on loop. The food had come out quickly. It’s apparently a slow night at the Takodana Chinese Restaurant. There’s only one other table tonight. This place should be so familiar, so comfortable. But instead of fighting with Finn over appetizers and stealing from each other’s plates and joking with the waitress, there is an uneasy silence. At an empty table near the back, Mr and Mrs Pava are yammering away in their native language, their heads close together. Rey sneaks glances as Mrs Pava brings one of the paper napkins she’s been folding into fans up to dab her eyes. Mr Pava reaches out to touch her shoulder, but his arm falls slowly back to his side. His other hand, the one on the table, clenches, scrunching a letter beneath his palm. Rey recognises something in their wordless exchange, an old familiar sting she can’t quite put words to. But she’s never been one to intrude. Finn is the one who reaches out to catch Jessika Pava’s arm as she walks past them, a tub of dirty dishes in her hands. “Jessika,” he asks, voice low and forehead creased in concern, “are your parents alright?” Jessika’s smile is a little thin, her eyes are a little shiny. “Oh, yeah,” she says, “everything is fine.” She gently shakes off Finn’s light grip. He’s about to say something, but Rey nudges him with her knee under the table, and flashes him a warning look. Finn shuts his mouth. Jessika continues on her way. Rey avoids Finn’s glare, and it is all she can do to stare at her plate of now cold, greasy noodles. She’s suddenly lost her appetite. ==================================================== It’s a subdued walk back to their apartment. Normally, Finn and Rey would race each other – to the next trashcan or the next streetlight. If drunk, Poe would begin serenading Finn, bellowing at the top of his lungs in Spanish. They might also have taken a long detour via Poe’s childhood favourite for cannoli and Italian hot chocolate - at least they might have if Frankie’s bake shop hadn’t closed down six months ago. A brightly-lit rice-pudding ‘bar’ had taken its place. Overpriced rice-pudding never did quite seem to hit the spot like a good cannoli could. Poe was crushed when he found out. They are quiet when they climb up the two flights of stairs. No jostling, or shushing as Finn turns the key and gives the stubborn door a deliberate shove with his shoulder to push it open. They disperse, each going their separate ways to begin their nightly rituals in preparation for bed. Poe’s already in bed by the time Rey’s switching off the living room lights. She can hear him snoring. She hopes he doesn’t do that all night. Finn is still hanging outside his bedroom door. He reaches out his hand to clasp Rey’s. They grin at each other. “Thanks for letting Poe move in, Peanut.” His eyes are glistening, and Rey’s heart melts. It’s sweetheart, straight-from-the-bottom-of-his-soul Finn. Rey bites her lip. “I want you to be happy, Finn.” Finn squeezes her fingers. “Sweet dreams, Peanut.” “Good night, Finn.” They close the doors to their respective bedrooms at the same time. But it takes a while for Rey to finally fall asleep. Chapter 3 : I Will Come Back, Then The bus was late. She had to run from the stop all the way to Maz’s Cantina. The normally studious Jessika wasn’t on campus today. Odd. It’s an unusually busy Wednesday night. They’re being run off their feet. Finn practically sobbed and praised the Lord when she turned up. Maz wasn’t in tonight. According to Grumpy Unkar, she left just after lunch saying she felt unwell. Normally a steady fixture, Maz’s absence is felt keenly today. Rey’s feeling a little overwhelmed. It’s days like this that makes her think she might actually hate her job. Sure, she loves Maz’s gruff, no-nonsense affection, she loves that she gets to work with her best friend. Her regulars, the ones she’s gotten to know and care about, are great. Hell, she might even like Grumpy Unkar. When you catch him in a good mood, he can be pretty funny. But sometimes - just sometimes - customers can get too pushy, too rude, and forget that she isn’t just a waitress - but a complete person. She’s immune mostly, but sometimes, they get a good jab in. She’s forced to smile, and roll with the punches while dealing silently with all her other stuff. A term paper that’s she can’t seem to get right, the fact that she knows one of her friends is upset but doesn’t quite know what to do about it, then there’s that constant gnawing she has always felt at her core, dull like a nerve being twanged, the old wound that she almost forgot she ever had at all… “Excuse me, miss ,” the woman wearing chunky plastic jewellery says, tone affecting cordiality – as if being polite actually required her conscious effort. She had the audacity to grab Rey’s elbow as she’d passed by, “can you please chase up my order, again ?” Rey manages to not spill everything she’s holding over the woman’s stupid head. “I’m sorry for the wait,” Rey’s voice is trained to the pleasant tone she’s gradually perfected, “it’s coming soon.” “Yes, but I’d still like you to chase it for me.” Rey doesn’t snap at her, but the urge is strong. “Sure thing!” “ Thank you. ” The woman’s shrill sing-song is at once dismissive and sarcastic. As Rey continues on her way, she hears it. A loud, not-whisper to the greasy man whose knee the woman is grabbing. She means for Rey to hear it. “My god, papi, that waitress is fucking useless .” Rey wants to spit on their food when she brings it out. She doesn’t. The woman’s response was an exaggerated eye roll, a “ finally, ” and a “I’m still missing my side salad.” Rey’s simmering by now, and tries not to stomp on her way back to the kitchen window. She is ignoring the relentless drone around her as she tries to calm herself down. Only a few more hours, then she can retreat back to her dreaded term paper. Finn appears beside her, slightly breathless. He’s hastily checking the slips before loading up with three heavily-laden plates. His arms are full when he points with his chin towards the great, olive-green door. “BFG.” He sounds unimpressed. And so it is. Overdressed in another fancy suit, the Giant is a little less perfect today, looking a little creased around the edges. He seems angry at whoever he’s on the phone with. Rey dumps the side salad with a thunk on the woman’s table, ignoring her “ Hey! Watch it! ” The Giant is practically seething when he shoves his phone inside his heavy coat. But as soon as his eyes meet Rey’s, they soften just a little bit. He seems to recognize her. “Hello! Table for one, again?” He nods, shrugging off his coat and scarf. “Follow me!” Unfortunately, she hasn’t had the chance to clear this table yet. She sets about doing so as he stands just a little too close behind her. When she’s gathered all of the dirty dishes, he gives her his tiny smile as he drapes his coat and scarf over the empty chair. “Take a seat, I’ll get you a menu.” Rey is going to do just that when she feels a sharp jab on her lower back. Turning around, she sees its the woman again, her long, orange nail still pointed towards her. “Water.” She demands. “Sure thing!” Another order is ready to be served. One of the tables are finishing up with their meal. Rey needs to quickly ring them up. Oh, right, the Giant. She’s grabbed a menu and is laying it in front of him when the woman pokes her, again. “Hey, lady! Where’s my water?” “Sorry, I’ll be right back with it.” “ Ay Dios Mio…” Rey turns back to the Giant. He doesn’t look happy. One of his fists are clenched over the menu before him. Rey gestures towards it. “Would you like a minute?” “No.” Rey scrambles for her order pad. He glances down, shifting his hand slightly so he could read. “I’ll have… the baked chicken.” Rey writes it down, then waits for the rest of his order. Perhaps she waits a bit too long, because his expression changes to a slight grimace. But his tone is one of concern “…are you alright?” Her cheeks feel suddenly warm; she resists the urge to touch them. “Oh. I’m sorry. I thought you were gonna order something else.” He tilts his head slightly. “Something else?” “I thought you would order more, is what I mean.” His tiny smile is back. “No. I just want baked chicken tonight.” “Sure thing!” She reaches for the menu and he lifts his hand so she can pick it up. She’s about to rush off again when she feels herself getting poked and grabbed. “Hey, don’t you dare forget my water this time.” Rey’s ready to explode now. Feels herself reaching for a huge verbal slap-down. But her rage fizzes out at the sound of snapping fingers and a low, hissing whistle. Surprised, both women turn to look at the Giant. He is unhappy again. But his voice is deep and even when he speaks. “She will get your water. Remove your hand, now.” Rey feels the woman’s hand fall from her arm. She feels rather than sees the greasy man shift his seat, as if he wants to get up and defend his woman. But the Giant, without a word, without twitching one muscle, manages to turn from mere displeasure to scarily...threatening. Whatever fight that might have broken out between them dissipates as the man slowly sits his ass back down. The Giant turns his gaze away, releasing all three of them. The woman turns back in her seat, and avoids looking at Rey. Rey doesn't care about her now. She's far too stunned. The Giant isn’t just some big, slightly confused, adorkable guy - he has bark and teeth and bite. And Rey doesn’t know what how she feels about that. ==================================================== Rey’s pretty much tried to dodge the Giant afterwards. Grabby and Greasy pay their check without a word. Rey knows they’ll never return. Good riddance. When she rings up the Giant, he does it again. Another fifty-dollar tip, for essentially leaving him alone all night. She should be feeling uneasy, maybe a little scared of him, but his gaze holds no expectation. Instead, he regards her with an unreadable look. His mouth works as if he wants to say something, but he then masters it. How could someone’s eyes be so expressive yet hard to read at the same time? She should maybe thank him and is trying to find the words. But he’s already turned to leave; he’s already opened the door. Rey’s said it a thousand times. A cheerful little goodbye that’s lost all meaning. Although, with him almost gone, she thinks she’s saying it to make him stay just a little longer. “Come back soon.” It comes out wrong, on the cusp between a question and a request. She prays he didn’t hear it that way. But he does. Her heart is beating way too fast. His voice is so quiet, so earnest, Rey almost doesn’t hear him. “…would you like me to come back?” Her heart stops for a moment. She’s looking down at the counter, mulling over the question. She knows he is waiting for her answer. “…yes.” He lingers by the open door, and she still can’t read the expression on his face. But something has shifted, she can feel it. An eternity passes between them. “I will come back, then.” “Ok.” “Ok.” As the door closes behind him, Rey lets out a deep breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding. Then, she's grinning like an idiot. Finn snorts as he laughs, drawing Rey’s attention. He is holding a coffee pot in one hand, his stomach in the other. “Peanut, I love you to death, but sometimes, you’re just so weird .” Rey feels like she’s flying. Chapter 4 : The Council Member Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “It’s fucking crazy! They’re ruining the community. Can’t you do anything about this?” “Yeah, we’ve even had the cops show up to shut us down! A noise complaint! For the annual block party! We’ve been doing this every year for over thirty years! Thirty years!” “Fucking yuppie-hipster newcomers…” “Get off your ass and do something!” “Yeah!” Rey bends down to Finn’s ear. “Do we really need to be here?” Finn looks just as miserable as her. “I promised Poe.” Rey decides to shut her mouth. She really didn’t need to be here. Neither did Finn. They were roped in. ================================================ It had started with a phone call. Right in the middle of a Star Wars movie marathon. Finn dug into the pockets of his sweatpants, mouthing an apology. Rey smiled and shrugged. Maybe it was a sign from above. She should really have been working on her term paper, anyway. Finn’s eyes lit up when he saw the caller ID. Poe. It didn’t seem to matter that they had been together for almost two years, that they now shared the same apartment, slept in the same bed, Finn’s eyes always lit up when Poe called. He practically squealed, waving his cell in front of Rey’s face, before he untangled his legs from her, threw off the comforter and bounded off the couch. “Hey, baby! You coming home?” Rey had one eye on the television, one eye on Finn. She watched as his eyes slowly dimmed. She tried not to listen in on Finn’s increasingly hissed, clipped responses. “You lied! You said you’d be… hold on, what? Why didn’t you tell me before?” Rey turned the volume up on the TV. Finn reached over, snatched the remote from her fingers and muted the set. Rey was left playing with her thumbs. “You FORGOT?” Poe’s frantic apologies filled the tiny apartment, and he wasn’t even on loudspeaker. Finn finally closed his eyes as he sighed. “Fine,” he’d bit out, as he pressed his phone harder against his cheek, “yes, ok.” Rey couldn’t help but see his utter defeat in the way his body hunched over as he pouted and scratched his nails along the top of the couch. “But just this once, ok? For the love of…yes! I still love you. Bye.” Silence. He stood for a long while, head dipped, tapping the corner of the phone against his fat bottom lip. Deep in thought. When he finally looked up at Rey, he was smiling again. “Peanut. Do you wanna do me a huuuuge favor?” ================================================= And that was how they’d ended up here, on the edge of a storm. Unwittingly volunteered out for an unofficial gathering of the Takodana community. Maz, it turned out, had offered to host at her Cantina. Poe had apparently promised her on the fly that he would help. Except he had forgotten, and there was also a crisis at work he couldn’t get away from. So when Finn and Rey showed up two hours ago, Maz was a little surprised. But she was a woman who never stayed surprised for too long, and soon she was directing them this way and that. Brew up coffee in the big urns, set out trays of clean cups and boxes of glazed donuts. Push the tables aside, make a circle with the chairs. Stay around, children, you’ll need to help out at the end. They sat as far away as they could from a shouting horde of business owners and concerned community members. Most of their irritation was directed – right or wrongly – at the greying, scruffy, professorial looking man standing in the middle of the circle. A council member, apparently. He held up his hands in a placating manner, an unwavering calm in the furor. “Now, now, everybody.” He struggles to raise his voice, as if unused to speaking louder than a whisper, “I know what your concerns are. Believe me, I feel the exact same way you do…” “Even the Pavas are having the same damn problem! It’s the same damn thing that happened to Frankie! It’s happening all over!” A voice interjected. ‘Yeahs’ bubbled from the crowd. Jessika wasn’t here, but her parents were. They were nodding in agreement, fire in their eyes. Rey strains to find the interjector. She doesn’t recognize his round, red face. “You even remember the Pavas? You even remember Frankie?” The council member shoots a look at the speaker. His look wasn’t threatening, but it was enough to quiet everyone down. “I care about Takodana, just as much as everybody else here.” The council member began again, “I’m aware of what’s been happening to our community. I’m sorry that whatever I’ve done so far hasn’t seemed to help...” The red-faced interjector looks ready to speak again, but he’s shut down by another look. He crosses his arms, huffs and retreats further back into his chair. Satisfied, the council member continues, “…but I can assure you, I am committed. But I’m also admitting to you, I need your help and support. That’s why I’m here tonight, to take consultation. So we can work together, and fight as communi…” “You know what,” It’s red-face again, unable to resist at last. “with all due respect, council member ,” he spits the title out like grit in his teeth, “you’re full of shit. You aren’t some knight here to save us little folks. Hell, you’re not even a real Takodana boy. You and your fucking council don’t give two shits about us...” Even Rey flinches at the tone. The scruffy man doesn’t respond. “...so why don’t you just fuck off back to Coruscant.” The room erupts into thunderous shouts, a smattering of applause. Rey watches as the scruffy man’s calmness slowly drifts into despair. ================================================ He sighs. This entire meeting was a bust. So many things were said, but nothing was accomplished. People had left angrier, dispersing into the night like he’d kicked a nest of bees. At least no one got hurt, no chairs were thrown. He has found a hole in the sleeve of his jacket, is thumbing it when Maz sets a cup of coffee in front of him. He looks at the coffee, looks at Maz. There is a simple, steady kindness in her eyes that reminds him of his old mentor, a strange tiny man who somehow held all the world’s wisdom in his small frame. Had it really been over twenty years since he’d died? Twenty years, and he still feels like a novice. Damn, he thinks, when did I get so goddamn old . “I’m sorry,” Maz soothes, “I know you’re trying your best.” The words still echo loudly across the decades. “Do, or do not. There is no try.” Maz's eyes water, she blinks and its gone. “Don’t you worry, child. I’ll straighten them out.” She could do it. That’s not why he laughs. “Maz, I’m a fifty-year-old man; hardly a child anymore.” Maz’s eyes crinkle as she smiles, “Luke Skywalker. When you get to my age, everybody is a child.” For a second, the years melt away. He’s no longer tired and troubled by the fights against his own blood, with failing the people he cares about, with feeling like he’s throwing himself at a wall that won’t budge. One precious second, and then it passes. He gulps down the lukewarm coffee, steels his belly and rolls up his shirt sleeves. Self-pity never did anybody any good. “Alright, Maz, let’s clean up this mess.” There are tables and chairs to put right, dishes to clean, floors to sweep and mop. It feels good to do some actual work. He can see the two kids helping out are… well not exactly shy, but unsure of him. That’s to be expected – he’s a strange man, who’s also apparently the center of a pretty major shit-storm. That couldn’t have made for a good first impression. Having said that, he’d never been the kind of man who goes out of his way to impress. His sister had words to say about that fact. But there is something else. He notices how they cling to each other like kittens tossed out into the rain. When he goes to take the chairs from the girl, she just grips them tighter. Offering him a slightly fake, friendly smile, but he can see the wariness tucked behind her eyes. “It’s ok, council member. I’ve got it.” She says, her voice firm but polite. He feels an overwhelming need to be kind to her, he thinks that she’s been deprived of it, that she needs it. “Please, call me Luke.” Her friend is hovering nearby. So Luke lets the chair go. The green door bangs open, eliciting an angry yell from Maz. “Don’t you be tearing down my place, boy!” “I’m sorry, Maz… hey baby.” It's the Dameron boy, Poe. But Luke doesn’t seem to rate a notice. Poe’s running past him to the boy, going to hold the young man’s face in his hands and kiss him. The boy turns his head away. “I’m still mad.” “I’m sorry, baby. I’m really sorry.” Poe’s rubbing the boy’s shoulders in an effort to placate him, then he’s looking around, as if asking for help. First to the girl, then finally settling onto Luke. Poe’s eyes widen in recognition. “Luke. I meant to get here sooner.” Poe doesn’t let go of the boy as he reaches out his hand to shake Luke’s. “It’s alright, Poe. You didn’t miss anything important.” “That’s good. Or bad. Oh, um…” Poe hesitates for a second, reading the awkwardness in the room. “Have you guys met? This is my boyfriend, Finn. That’s Rey, friend and housemate. That’s Luke, old family friend.” Luke feels a little bit silly, his hand held up in a greeting gesture he's seen kids do these days. But it works, he sees a smile. That, and the fact Poe likes him seems to make the boy and girl less guarded. They work together quite well after that, and soon the cantina is back to its usual self. It’s raining when Maz gets ready to lock up. “I’m driving you home.” Luke says, leaving no room for disagreement. He looks at the three youngsters. “Do you need a ride?” “It’s alright, we just live down…” the girl, Rey, begins. “Yeah, that’ll be fantastic, thanks Luke.” Poe cuts in. It’s going to be a tight squeeze. Luke is grateful he had the foresight to vacuum his car on the weekend. ================================================ “Kids, stay in the car while I walk Maz to her door.” “It’s alright, Luke, I’ll do it.” Poe flashes a toothy grin he pops open his car door, pulling his leather jacket up over his head. He still manages to get soaked through. He tries to shield Maz as she clings to him. They blur into the rain. “Thank you, for offering us a lift.” Rey, again. “Yeah, thanks, Luke.” Finn. “You’re welcome.” Luke glances at his rear-view mirror, catching their eyes. “Rey, if I’m not mistaken, that accent - Jakku?” The girl sits stiffer. The boy’s eyes are darting around. Luke thinks he’s made the wrong move here. He tries again. Talking to people isn’t his strong suit. “You’ve probably figured I’m not from these parts either. I spent my younger years out on a farm in Tatooine.” “Couldn’t tell.” She says. Yep, Luke definitely said the wrong thing. Poe’s slightly breathless when he jumps back into the car. He seems to sense the tension but says nothing. “Is Maz settled, Poe?” Luke asks. “Yep.” Luke flicks his indicator and pulls out onto the street. By the time he’s pulled up outside the youngster’s apartment, the rain is easing to a drizzle. He has made his mind. He almost feels like he is diving back into the same puddle, knowing that it’s quicksand. He hasn't reached out like this in so long, but he feels he needs to. The car door is open, the tiny cabin warmed by a little yellow light. He turns around, arm braced against the empty passenger seat. He locks eyes with the boy and the girl. They stop unbuckling their seatbelts. “If you kids need anything,” he says, “let Poe know. I promise I’ll be there to help you kids in anyway I can.” Luke doesn’t know it, wouldn’t be able to tell by the stony face the girl’s giving him. But Rey, even surprising herself, believes he's telling the truth. Notes: First of all, thank you guys for your support. I've gotten something like fifty kudos. Honestly, I didn't expect this response. Thanks, much love and hope you enjoy! Chapter 5 : I am Kylo Ren Notes: Rey swears a lot in this chapter. But there is a reason. She's upset. Forgive her. Kylo POV (finally). ------------------------------------------------------------------ On Fridays, Rey has to leave the campus at three pm. From there, it’s a forty-five-minute commute involving two buses and a brisk walk/run to arrive mere minutes before the dinner shift started. She hadn’t wanted to back awkwardly out of the packed Corner Coffee, across the street from CU, leaving a visibly upset Jessika sobbing into Finn’s shoulder. “We're going to have to leave Takodana.” “Shit.” Rey had said shit. What the hell kind of response is shit? She’s mad at herself – a swear wasn’t what Jessika needed. She needed someone to comfort her. The problem was, Rey didn’t know how to comfort people. Should she have hugged her? Buy her sweet foods? Maybe blow off work to talk shit out? Rey sucks at talking shit out. The only person she’s ever felt comfortable talking shit out with was Finn. Shit. Rey’s still mad at herself as she storms past a surprised looking Greta, the other waitress on for tonight. Rey doesn’t bother to fold her heavy sweater, balling it up and shoving it roughly into her tote bag. She almost knots her fingers in her apron strings. “Leave Takodana.” “Shit.” This week just keeps getting better and better. “Rey,” Greta says, appearing at the door of the cubby-hole jokingly called the ‘staff-room’, the older woman’s permanent frown is deeper than usual, “Maz isn’t coming in tonight either. It’s just the two of us.” Shit. Shit. Shit. ==================================================== Fuck. Even an old hand like Greta is barely keeping up. The place is packed, and for the first time since Rey can remember, there is an actual line waiting to get into Maz’s Cantina. This is getting out of hand. Maz needs to hire another waitress. Rey prides herself on being good at her job, but she can hear the steel edge on her voice, feel the brusqueness in her manner, as she flies like a ping-pong ball from table to counter to bar to kitchen and back again. “Excuse me, this isn’t my order.” Rey let out a frustrated, long-winded “urgh”, stunning the kindly-looking elderly man and his wife. Rey stunned herself too. She immediately falls on apologies. “I’m really, really sorry, sir. I didn’t mean… here let me fix that for you right away.” Grabbing the plate, she rushes back to the kitchen window, grabs the slip for a quick check. Fuck, she’d served to the wrong table. If she’s managed to confuse herself, she should maybe work on making her fives not look like threes. She quickly turns around, skirts the bar, nudges her way between two tables, just narrowly misses the woman who suddenly pushes her seat out, and then slams, hard, into something solid. Greta is yelling. Rey watches in horror. Marinara smears red all over a crisp white shirt. The plate bounces before it explodes into thick shards. Rey’s hands immediately fly to tug on her apron strings before pulling the cloth off her body. She frantically tries to daub at the man’s shirtfront. It’s not working, the red seeps deeper, the mark spreads wider. “Oh…no. I’m so sorry, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god…” It’s then that large, pale hands still hers. She looks up. It’s the Giant. ==================================================== “…Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god…” He had been winded by her. He feels heat licking at his stomach from the spilled sauce. He stood motionless as the girl tries to clean him off. She is making a mess of it. He is not angry at her. Instead, he is gently holding her hands. Trying to quell her panic. Now, she is looking up at him. She takes his breath away and he does not know why. She keeps babbling. He wants to kiss her forehead, smooth back her hair. It is an impulse he catches just in time. He shushes her instead. “It’s ok.” The other waitress, the older one who had served him last night, is talking at him. He does not ignore her so much as he simply cannot hear her. His world has narrowed to the girl before him. He is leaning down towards the girl now, as close as he can without scaring her. She smells like diner grease and sweat and something else. Something unbearably sweet, light and floral – a cheap, artificial scent that is far too mature for her. It does not repulse him as it should; he finds he likes it. He holds back a groan. “Are you alright?” He murmurs. The girl has stopped babbling, but has not stopped looking at him. She gives him a small nod. He cannot control the urge to smile. He does not like to smile; it is a sign of weakness. “Can you show me to the restroom?” She pulls one of her hands from his grip, points behind him. “Thank you.” He releases her hands, and heads off into the direction she had pointed him towards. It is a shared restroom, unoccupied. He lets himself in, slides the lock in place. The sink is old, worn from years of cleaning. He braces himself against it, taking a deep breath before he glances into the rusting mirror to assess the damage. She had wiped off most of the excess. But his shirt is unsalvageable. Unfortunate. It is sheer luck that he was not wearing his suit jacket, that it was draped over his arm and safely out of the way when she bumped into him. He shakes it out now, carefully pulls it on, buttons the top button. He runs his hand down to smooth a wrinkle, then maneuvers his body to examine the result in the mirror. He can still see the stain, but it is less noticeable now. It will do. He hears gentle knocking on the restroom door. “Hello? It’s me, again. Is everything ok in there?” He turns to slide the lock open, pulls open the door. He takes one step forward and fills the doorway. It is her. Their eyes find each other easily, before her gaze drifts down onto the stain. He watches as she reaches out to touch it, to touch him. She pauses just as he feels her fingertips press against his stomach. She withdraws as if he is scorched iron. “Oh, I’m sorry…” Her eyes are wide set and impossibly large. They are beautiful. He could not stop himself. “I don’t know your name.” He is muttering again, there is wonder in his tone. She makes him weak. “I...sorry?” He repeats himself. Louder, slower. “I do not know your name.” “Are you asking?” He doesn’t reply. He watches her press her lips together, her body tense, a thousand thoughts fly through her mind. He wishes he could hear them. Eventually, she relaxes. “My name is Rey.” “Rey,” he echoes. He tests, tastes the name. He likes it, it suits her. “Rey.” He smiles again, she smiles back. “Can I ask you yours?” “Yes.” He replies. “I am Kylo Ren.” Chapter 6 : Reunion Summary: I know I left you Reylo lovers hanging. Here's some more plot development. I'm evil. Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Luke Skywalker's car screeches in protest as it slows to a stop outside the high, wrought iron gates of Organa House. He yanked up the handbrake as he fought viciously with his ancient hand-crank to wind down his window. The voice that came out of the intercom was tinny, but he understood it well enough. “Please identify yourself.” “This is…ahem!” Luke clears his throat, swallows and tries again. “This is Luke Skywalker, Council Member Luke Skywalker. I believe Senator Organa is expecting me?” The intercom cuts. Luke taps his steering wheel, hums a well-loved ditty. Duh-da-Duh-da-Duhda-Duh… Eventually, the tinny voice returns with a crackle. “Council member, please proceed.” The huge gate slowly swings open, and Luke grimaces as he drops his handbrake. He shouts a hasty thank you towards the intercom, before gingerly easing his ancient car down the long, winding driveway. The meeting had been easy enough to arrange. What was hard was picking up the telephone and dialing the number he’d been staring at for so long that he had it memorized. It took liquid courage to place the call. He sees two men in black suits wave at him, and follows their gestures until he is parked outside the grand entrance the imposing old world mansion. One of the men steps forward, pointing his blinding flashlight towards the ground. “Good evening, council member. The senator has said that she was expecting you. Can you please show us some identification, sir?” He realizes he recognizes none of these security guards. Perhaps he has been gone for too long. Luke fumbles inside his well-worn tweed jacket, producing his council issued identification. “There you go.” The guard quickly scans the card, before handing it back. “Everything appears in order, sir. If you would like to follow me, the senator is already waiting for you.” Luke struggles his way out of his car, vowing to himself again that he would re-double his efforts to get to a healthier weight. When he frees himself, the guard leads him up the few steps towards the front door. It opens immediately, answered by a prim, golden-haired man who seemed pleased to see him. “Good evening, Master Luke! It is a pleasure to see you again. Please, this way.” Luke grins in response, clapping the Organa butler on his shoulder. Stiff as a tin can, as always. “How are you, Threepio?” “I’m very well, sir.” Luke follows, allowing himself to drink in the rich furnishings of the house. It has changed much since he was here last time. Luke isn’t intimidated by the show of wealth; he just wonders how someone has busy as the senator found the time to accumulate everything. Once they reach the study, Threepio knocks and gently cracks open the door, standing stiffer as he begins to announce Luke, but the senator cuts him off quickly, blunt as always. Luke smiles. “That’s fine, Threepio, we can forego the formalities.” She pats the plush seat next to her. “Come on, Luke. Sit down.” Threepio bows as he exits the study. Senator Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker regard each other quietly for a while. “It’s been a long time since you’ve come to see me, Luke.” Leia begins, her posture ramrod straight, a hint of irritation in her voice. “It almost took me an entire army to track you down. Then I find out you’re not only living in Takodana, but you won a seat on the Coruscant City Council.” Luke is genuinely apologetic. “I’m sorry, Leia. After what happened, I needed to get away for a while…” Leia looks down at her hands, her shoulders sag. Luke can feel her softening. Her husky, sharp voice takes on a warmer tone. “It’s fine, Luke. I don’t blame you. What happened…it was partly my fault too. If only I’d paid more attention, been less involved with everything else…” “Hey, Leia. If it had to happen, it was going to happen. It’s hard to admit it, but he knew what he was doing.” “I can’t believe that’s his doing, though. All those poor people…” Leia turns away to hide her moistening eyes, “If Lor San Tekka himself hadn’t told me everything about what happened down in Jakku...” Her hands ball into tight fists on her lap. Luke can feel his heart aching. He hadn’t come to scratch and tear at old wounds. He reaches out to curl his hand around one of her fists. She readily laces her fingers with his. His voice is low now, “there was a corruption investigation and an official inquiry, but nothing came of them. I checked. Apparently everything was legal, and above board. I want to believe that.” He searched for hope in Leia’s eyes, but found none. “I still don’t believe he was so… ” “Heartless.” Leia sighed, and deliberately shook her entire body. She straightened up, her moment of weakness was gone. Luke admires her ability, but at the same time worries immensely that this strength came at too high a cost. “That’s not the boy I raised, Luke. I promise. I wanted him to be kind and caring and…” “I know, Leia. I know. Remember, I helped raise him too.” “You were just his uncle, Luke.” “I was also his teacher.” “But I am his mother.” There is a long pause. Luke contemplates his past sins, a bitter dram that still sits in his gullet. He has so many regrets, but none so great as this one. He felt dirty asking for this now. “He’s coming for Takodana next.” Leia was apparently one step ahead of him. She was always one step ahead of him. She stands, and walked over to the roaring fireplace, stares at the flames. “I…I can’t help you, Luke. I have no official jurisdiction over this matter.” “That’s not what I’m asking. Please, Leia. He listened to you once, he’ll listen to you again.” Leia’s laugh is harsh and bitter. “I think I lost that right years ago, Luke. He listens to no one now.” That is not true. An unuttered name passes between them. Leia sighs as she turns her back on her brother. Luke senses a finality in her straight posture. “I think this was a mistake. Please, Threepio will show you out the door.” Notes: Thank you for your continued support! Over 80 kudos! YAY!!! Chapter 7 : Information Gathering Notes: Kylo Ren is not a sweetheart. He directed his driver to his offices. It was closer than his apartment complex. As they crossed the bridge from Takodana back to Coruscant, he finds his thoughts drift to the girl, Rey. She had offered to replace his shirt. When he told her how much it had cost, she visibly paled. “Can…can I pay you back in installments?” She had asked him, stammering. “You don’t have to pay me back.” “No, that’s not right.” He was amused by her persistence. But he also saw an opportunity. A businessman of Kylo’s caliber never missed an opportunity. “Repay me another way. Have dinner with me.” She had agreed. He was…elated. Outside, the scenery changed from brick and brownstone to steel and glass and concrete. This was Kylo’s natural habitat. He can feel his veins swell with power. His driver lets him out at the executive carpark, where a private elevator took him to his offices directly. He headed to the adjacent suite, a bedroom he kept for his frequent late work nights. He picked out a spare shirt, a suit, and headed to the shower. The stained white shirt was tossed into the waste bin. His assistant, Phasma, was already long gone by this hour. As he fixes his cuff-links, he notices that the doors to his office is slid open. He has a vague idea of who it may be. He is displeased rather than surprised. He drops his suit jacket onto Phasma’s desk before entering his office. Only a single lamp was switched on. He slides the doors closed behind him and leaned back against the hard wood. He is right. He could recognize that silhouette even if he were being dragged screaming down to Hades. He cools his tone to ice. “I believe I rescinded my open invitation some time ago. You are required to wait…out…side.” She slinks out of the shadows, lithe as a panther. Even now, after all she had done to him, she can still send delicious shivers down his spine. She might even be aware that she has that effect on him. But Kylo Ren now is a very different animal from the Kylo Ren she had sunk her claws into years ago. He no longer hurt, but he still carries the scar. Kylo Ren always remembers his lessons well. She smirks, licks her blood-red upper lip, pouts with insincere guilt. “I am very sorry, sir.” Kylo fixes his stare, blatantly tracing her once familiar curves as he bounces himself off of the doors. He measures his strides across room, his heavy footsteps thunder. He turns to settle against his vast mahogany desk, spreading his palms wide behind him as he leans back. His expression remains one of indifference. She was circling him too; she is now standing by the bar. Her long, pretty fingers play with the stopper of his lead-crystal decanter. She plays coy when she raises an eyebrow and a low ball glass. Kylo nods slowly, watching as she strokes the stopper before tugging it free with a tink . She smirks at him as she pours out two fingers neat. She knows how he likes it. She sways as she walks towards him, stands in the space between his splayed legs, deliberately brushes his fingers with hers as she hands him the whisky. He holds her stare as he sips, regards her over the lip of the glass. She is very capable. She had once told him, after it was all over, that the past was the past. She had told him she was free. But he knew he could never be sure if she really was his creature, or if she was still secretly in bed with his father. So Kylo simply assumes the latter, although he has yet to find any proof. He sets down his glass with a satisfying clunk , his arms now crossed over his broad chest. “Exactly why are you disturbing me outside of office hours, Ms. Netal?” She smirks and holds her hands behind her back. She gives him a naughty little squirm. He chooses to ignore it. “I have some interesting information for you, sir. It seems your interviewer was playing with very big boys, and had a little too much fun.” He is reminded of why he was drawn to her. “I see. Was it as we expected?” She reaches out, walks her fingers along the lapel of his vest. Kylo quickly catches her offending hand and pulls her away. She is pouting again. He growls as a warning. “Yes, sir,” she continues, “in fact, I would say better than we expected. What we found was very… illustrative.” Kylo cocks his head, his tone a little indulgent now. “Oh, was it?” She nods as she practically purrs with self-satisfaction. Her hand slides up to his shoulder, fingers dip into his collar to stroke his neck. He does nothing, allows her to smirk in triumph. Her eyes lock with his as she cups her other hand, reaches down between his legs and presses against him firmly, only to find he is completely soft. Her eyes widen her hand falters. Kylo reaches for the last of the whiskey, throwing his head back as he drains it. He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and he fixes her with a smug half-grin. His voice at once as sweet and stinging as honey on a cut lip. “Well done, Bazine. Is that all?” Her hands fall from his body. They both know she’s been defeated. Her voice is small. “Yes, sir.” “Excellent. Leave your findings.” He leans forward, pecking then brushing his lips against her cheek, letting her feel his smile. She turns away from him. “Do keep me informed, Ms. Netal,” he growls into her ear, he nips her earlobe, hard. She shudders and whines with pain. He pulls away. He had once felt both love and hate for this woman. She is now simply a floating asset on his books. “You are dismissed.” She nods, slips quietly away. She held nothing over Kylo Ren anymore. No one did. Chapter 8 : Friday, onto Saturday She told Finn when she got home after her dinner shift. Finn didn’t believe her at first. He actually laughed, pinching her cheeks as he did so. “Yeah, good one, Peanut. You’re pretty woman and he’s the businessman who buys you for a week.” Rey swatted Finn’s hands from her face, rubbing the sore from her pinch-reddened cheeks as she ground out. “What are you talking about, Finn?” Poe cuts in, leaning over the couch and ignoring the game rerun. He had gotten home at a slightly more reasonable hour, for once. “You know, that movie, Pretty Woman? Big mouth lady and that guy with the gray hair?” Rey’s blank expression says it all. Poe is incredulous. “You’re kidding, right?” “Oh, sweet Lord! I’m sorry - I sometimes forget you had a deprived childhood.” Finn teases. Rey knows he doesn’t mean it, tries not to feel the barb. But something must have tipped him off, because she finds herself in the suffocating circle of his hug, his lips pressed hard against her forehead. She forgave him instantly. “Be thankful, Rey,” Poe said over Finn’s apology, his attention back on the game, “it’s my mama’s favorite movie. I’ve seen it a million times.” Finn’s grin was devious. “Come on, Peanut. Let’s make Poe watch it one million and one times.” Kylo wasn’t mentioned again. =============================================== So when Rey leaves her bedroom Saturday night, her face made up, her hair curled, wearing heels and a dress , Finn chokes on his Star Wars cereal, milk coming out of his nose. He’s cupping his face, trying not to asphyxiate as he runs to grab a kitchen towel from the drawer and to blow his nose with a loud honk. “Gross! Finn! And stop eating all the cereal! You’re gonna spoil your dinner.” Finn is fanning his nose to ease the milk-sting. “You weren’t kidding.” “About what?” Finn’s got his ‘fierce’ eyes on. He doesn’t return her smile. “Rey, what the fuck?” No Peanut, then. This was serious. “…he’s at least thirty years old, ugly as a monkey’s taint, and what the hell do you know about him, other than he makes it rain fifties instead of ones?” “Uh…his name is Kylo Ren?” Rey’s tone is joking, but it only infuriates Finn. “WHAT THE HELL KIND OF STUPID NAME IS KYLO FUCKING REN?” Finn throws up his hands. Holds them there for a moment, his eyes closed. He sucks in a deep breath. He only speaks again when he’d calmed down. “Peanut, you’ve seen this guy – what - twice? Spoken maybe ten words to him…” “Who are you to talk? You went out with Poe the day you met him at the Corner Coffee.” “Yeah, but Poe wasn’t some scary, creepy, rich asshole who’s probably slumming it for cheap thrills.” “Slumming it for cheap thrills? Geez, Finn. Thanks for letting me know what you really think of me.” “You know that’s not what I meant.” “I think I know exactly what you meant.” “No. You. DON’T.” Finn actually stamped his foot. Rey is panting from her outburst. Her purse is creaking in her tight grip; she throws it onto the couch. The two friends glare at each other like enemies. Then, Finn crosses the tiny space between them to gently hold her by her shoulders. He doesn’t let go even though she resists - in the beginning, anyway. His voice is soft. “I just don’t want you to get hurt, ok? I don’t know anything this guy but I’m already freaked out by him.” Rey speaks through clenched teeth. “Why?” “Why? First, he leaves big tips for absolutely no reason. You’ve gotta admit that’s creepy. Then… hell, you were right there, with the water bitch incident. You can’t tell me that he didn’t scare you.” Rey bites her lip, considers his words. He was right. Kylo had to have some kind of ulterior motive for leaving her fifty dollar tips. Was he trying to buy her? And he had scared her with the 'water bitch incident.' But she had also felt something else. She had been turned on. By him, by Kylo Ren. Finn shakes her gently. “Hello, Rey? We’re having an argument here.” “Discussion.” “Huh?” Rey looks up at her friend. Her hand gently cups his cheek, pecks his other one in a chaste kiss. Her heart is full, overflowing with affection for this high-strung, whiny, bitchy, pain-in-the-ass boy who is wearing the ugliest t-shirt she’s ever seen because it’s laundry day. Her unlikely guardian angel. “Finn,” she begins, slowly, “thank you for being such a good friend to me. But you don’t have to worry about me all of the time. I’m a big girl, I can take care of myself. You helped me with that.” Finn breaks out into a huge grin. “Yeah?” “Yeah.” “You know I’m never going to stop worry about you, right, Peanut?” “I know.” Finn sighs. He looks down at the floor, his hands slide down her arms until he’s swinging them with her hands in his. “I’m sorry I got carried away. Just… message me, alright? Let me know you’re ok.” Rey rolls her eyes. “Alright, dad.” A loud buzz breaks the moment. Rey’s phone shudders across the kitchen table. They both turn to look at the name flashing across the screen. Kylo Ren. “He’s here.” Rey says, her heart is already beginning to race. Finn frowns, let’s go of her hands as she goes to answer the phone. “Hello, Kylo? Yes, I’m ready. I’ll be down in two seconds.” She is smiling, the biggest, widest smile that Finn has ever seen on her face. “He’s waiting for me downstairs.” Rey grabs her discarded purse, stuffs her phone into it. Finn has already opened their stubborn apartment door for her. She fluffs the ends of her hair. “How do I look, Finn?” She asks, a little nervously, halfway out the door. Finn's instinct is to reassure her, even if he didn't want her to go. “If I weren’t gay as Christmas in May, I’d do you.” She laughs, then she’s climbing down the stairs. She waves at him as heads through the front gate. She lets it shut behind her with a loud clang . Finn goes to throw out his soggy cereal. Chapter 9 : Restaurant Galatina Summary: Kylo and Rey go on their date. ------------------- Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) From the way he styled his long, dark hair, to the selection of his cologne, Kylo Ren had paid more than the usual amount of care in preparing himself tonight. He had sent his assistant to his home earlier to collect items he thought would be suitable. He now stood before the full-length mirrors in his wardrobe, criticizing and critiquing his chosen outfit. He held two silk neckties in his hands, testing their effect on his ensemble, before deciding to abandon ties altogether. He deemed it inappropriate for tonight. There were three firm taps against the door-frame. He does not bother to turn and look, he knows who it is. Although he is fully dressed, his assistant politely averts her eyes. “You have confirmed my table at the Restaurant Galatina then, Phasma?” He asks. He has flipped up the collar of his shirt, is reaching for a pair of collar stays of correct size. “Yes, sir. The private dining room has been made available, at your leisure. They send their regards.” Kylo only hums in response. He expects her to leave, she does not. “You interview will go ahead on Monday. Mr. Snoke has requested the pleasure of your company on Wednesday night. I am under the impression he has asked that Mr Hux be in attendance.” “Wonderful, a family reunion then.” His sarcasm is subtle enough that goes unnoticed. “Yes, sir.” “Did my father say anything else, Phasma?” “No, sir. Although he has been asking me questions about your recent projects.” “Usual or unusual questions?” Phasma never hesitates with her answers. Kylo had ensured that she learned the fate of her predecessor, the one who thought they could conceal and outsmart him. Both fear and loyalty in the right amounts worked better than either in isolation. “Usual questions, sir. Although Mr Snoke’s showing a great level of interest in one particular project, the…” He cuts her off. He knows which one. He feels a black knife stab at his ribs. “Is that all?” Kylo turns down his collar, stares at his reflection. He is complete at last, although any satisfaction he might have gotten had seeped away with Phasma’s answers. “Yes, sir.” “Very well. Good evening, Phasma.” “Good evening, sir.” ==================================================== He stares out the window of his car, chin on his fist. He does not see the scene passing before him. His father’s summons had dampened his mood somewhat. Kylo can only assume his father doubts him, doubts his filial piety, doubts his utter submission, born not because of thin threads of nucleic acid and the accident of biology, but because of his free-will. Kylo Ren was devoted to his father, because he had chosen his father. His fingers grip his thigh hard enough to hurt and bruise. The car slows, stops. Kylo doesn’t notice, and is awoken only by the soft pop of the intercom. It is his driver. “Mr Ren, we have arrived.” He pulls out his phone. ==================================================== Rey sees Kylo just outside the front gate of her building, leaning against a big, black car. His breath turns to mist in the cold air. She can see he is shivering, just a little bit. He looks different when he isn’t wearing a suit. He still dresses far better than her though. He smiles at her, his tiny little smile, his eyes shining. Rey blushes when his eyes trail down her body, then quickly snap back up when he realizes what he was doing. She’s wearing a long coat and is mostly hidden, but she can still see his throat work as he swallows. Rey feels suddenly shy, despite the flush of adrenaline still pulsing from her argument with Finn. He pushes himself off of the car and opens the door to the back seat. She’s confused for a second. He seems to realize why, quickly enough. “I have a driver.” He explains softly, almost as if he’s embarrassed. “Oh…” Rey clambers in, sighing to find that the black leather is already warmed. He closes the door for her, goes around to let himself in. Once they are settled, he reaches for a console on the roof of the cabin. “We are ready to go.” The response is immediate. “Yes, Mr Ren.” Rey clutches her purse tighter. There is silence for a minute. “Where are we going?” “You look beautiful.” They had spoken at the same time. She laughs, from embarrassment as well as from his compliment. He looks away for a moment, then back at her. “I hope you don’t mind,” he says, “I’m taking you to a restaurant in Coruscant, just off the Senate District.” In the three years she’s been here, she has never explored the Coruscant proper beyond the immediate confines of the CU campus. But she knows about the Senate District. She looks down at her clothes, feeling suddenly self-conscious. He reaches out to hold her hand, and she’s startled by his warmth. But she accepts it. “I really do mean it, Rey, you look beautiful tonight.” His earnest tone draws her gaze. “Are you sure?” She gestures to herself. He has to swallow again. “Yes. But if you are worried, I reserved for us a private dining room.” He says gently. That both makes her relax and feel uncomfortable at the same time. He notices, she can tell. “What is wrong, Rey?” She is awed by him. She thinks back to her argument with Finn. She doesn’t want to offend him either. “I’m…I’m just a waitress in a crappy diner, Kylo.” He seems to like it when she said his name, despite everything else she’d said. He shifts a little closer to her, and she can smell his scent wrap around her. Cloves, she thinks. Spicy wood, darkness. He speaks to her unspoken concerns. “Rey, if you think anything is too much for you, if you think you want to put an end to this night at any point, I promise won’t stop you.” He gently touches her chin, tips her face up to meet her eyes. “But I sincerely hope that you want to stay.” She answers before she fully processes what he’d said. “I want to stay.” “Really?” She nods as he holds her. He smiles, and she thinks he wants to kiss her, but he releases her instead. His fingers interlace with hers readily, as if they had done it a thousand times before. She swears she can hear her heartbeat, and so can he. ==================================================== The restaurant is located on the seventy-third floor of the Naberrie Tower. It was absolutely beautiful. Creams and gold, gentle lines, and soft, warm, golden light. Kylo was immediately recognized, and fawned over by the ingratiating maître d’ himself. “Mr Ren,” his lightly accented voice greets, “it is an absolute pleasure to see you, and your guest, if you would kindly follow me. Your table is ready.” The maître d’ had seemed a little put-off by Rey’s appearance. He didn’t cast a judging eye, but she finds herself falling in step behind Kylo, even as he held her hand. They walk through a hidden alcove, away from all the other finely dressed diners. The maître d throws open a set of ornate double doors with a flourish, and Rey finds herself in a room with a completely different tone to the rest of the restaurant. It is a small space, lending to a more intimate atmosphere, and furnished both luxuriously and comfortably. A large window, reaching from the ceiling to the floor, let in the living silvers and bronzes of Coruscant’s after-dark skyline. As she stepped in, she felt as if she had entered someone’s private domain. The door closed behind them, and the hum of the restaurant is suddenly gone. Kylo led her to the table set before the expansive splendor of the city. He pulls out her chair, pushes her in before he moves to sit opposite her. For a moment, she forgets Kylo and gazes out the window. “Do you like it?” He asks. She can’t stop smiling at him. “Kylo, I love it.” He had apparently planned everything already. A quick succession of dishes is brought before her. She is served wine, light and crisp, as well as sweet and heavy, and food with smells, flavors and textures indescribably new and wonderful. She moaned in pleasure at tasting one savory dish, gasping as it melted inexplicably in her mouth and left her wanting more. Kylo watched her, cradling a glass of dark, purple wine in his hand, faced flushed with what could only be described as arousal. She feels an answering throb. When they are done, the sky is impossibly black against the defying lights of the city. Kylo wordlessly gets up from his chair, pulls her up and takes her by her hand. He leads her, single-mindedly, through the hidden alcove, through the lobby of the restaurant, until they stand before the bank of elevators. She finds she can’t stop looking up at him. His eyes are darker than before. “Rey,” voice low, almost a rumble. He reaches out to touch her face, to brush his thumb across her lips. “Kylo.” She breaths. “I live on the ninetieth floor.” He sounds guilty, caught out. Hopeful. His earnestness sends warmth through her belly, a thick gush that pools down between her suddenly hot thighs. She whimpers, and can only nod. He kisses her then. Notes: 90 kudos!? For real? Thanks, everyone! Chapter 10 : Her Pleasure Summary: The next two chapters are explicit. Consider yourself warned. His kiss is unexpectedly soft, sweet, chaste. She feels his entire body sigh, sink into her. He pulls away to leave her breathless and dazed. His kiss didn’t demand but she still feels desperately needed all the same. She feels her awe returning. He steadies himself, reaching into the breast pocket of his jacket, producing his keycard and sliding it into the control panel. The elevator arrives almost instantly, and with a dull metallic ding and a heavy rumble , the doors open and the empty car stands waiting. He looks down at her again, his eyes still dark and lustful, his eyebrow is raised in a wordless question. She nods again. He lifts her hand high and with a low chuckle, dancing to music only he hears, he twirls her into the elevator car. Her surprised laughter bubbles up sweetly as she is spun. She ends up her back is flushed against his clothed body, his arm possessive over her belly. She giggles, then moans as he reaches to thread his fingers deep in her hair and tug gently, before placing slow, open mouthed kisses and nibbles along her exposed neck. He positively hums against her skin, presses himself tighter against her. She thinks she can feel him, there, and she blushes even deeper. A dull dun-don, and the elevator doors open directly into a vast, expansive room. She notices none of the details of his home. She is distracted when he suddenly swoops down with a playful growl, and snatches her up like a dragon-of-old, carries her bridal style through the dimly lit expanse. It is like she weighs nothing to him. He sets her down on the floor in front of his sprawling, slate-gray bed. Indulges her enough to allow her to pull him down for a kiss, before he extracts himself from her grasp. She writhes as his hands fall to her shoulder, slip down to ghost the clothed swell of her breast. His fingers slide under the fabric of her jacket to push it off her shoulders. It pools heavily at her feet. She allows him to slowly undress her, leaving a trail of nips, licks and kisses in his wake. When she is completely undressed, he toes off his shoes, then crowds her until she lies back onto the bed. His eyes are roiling with emotions she can’t place. She is completely bared and naked, and for the first time in her life, she doesn’t feel at all ashamed or embarrassed to be so in another’s presence. She watches as he palms himself though his pants when she parts her legs for him. The most pathetic whine escapes his lips as he sees her exposed for the first time. She feels wetness slide from her, a slow leak that leaves a sticky trail along her skin. He whimpers and he desperately grips himself tighter, digging in with his nails. When he hisses, she realizes his grip is too harsh to be pleasurable. He is trying to regain control. Her clit throbs and begs to be touched. She resists the urge, willing to forgo just to watch him break apart without laying a finger on her. He eventually lets go of himself, shrugs off his jacket, removes his belt, lets it drop from where he stands. The mattress dips as he places a knee on it. He is looking between her legs hungrily when he speaks, actually licks his lips and swallows hard. He sounds tortured. “Rey, please, may I…?” She know what he wants, answers before he finishes. “Yes.” “Oh, thank you...” She is encouraged to shift higher up on the bed, to spread her legs wider in order to give his big, broad body every inch she can spare. He doesn’t bother with teasing, he meets her eyes only once, before his head drops to her inner thighs and he nuzzles her soft skin. She feels his groans when he loudly inhales her arousal. “Rey, you smell so good,” he growls, “I want to bathe in you forever.” Her hip thrusts involuntarily at this words. Then, her skin is pulled into his mouth, and he sucks. “Oh…fuck!” Rey can’t stop the hard hip buck against his face. It doesn’t throw him off, but he holds her still as he licks and sucks and fucks her with his mouth, filling the room with wet, sticky, obscene sounds. Her eyes roll back, her fingers thread through his hair, scratching his scalp before she tugs him like they’re reins. He hums and purrs against her, grinding his pelvis against the edge of the bed in time with his tongue. She looks down at him as she feels herself begin to peak, his eyes closed as he suckles and swipes wetly at her clit. As if he feels her stare, he lazily opens one of his dark eyes, sucks hard, then slowly rasps the rough flat of his tongue along her hard, exposed clit. The intense pleasure sparkles with pain and she orgasms with a shout and a cry. When she comes down, bones heavy and muscles weak, he is kneeling between her legs, entirely too self-satisfied. He looks like he’s been thoroughly well-fucked, even though he’s the one that’s been fucking. She can’t imagine what she looks like. “What the fuck was that, Kylo?” She demands, her throat feeling harsh. She must have been screaming. His smirk is cocky. She has never seen that expression on his face before. It makes the heat rise again. “You are being entirely too vulgar, darling.” He coos. He moves to hover over her, his hand drifting to untuck his shirt, unbutton his fly. “But I like it.” Chapter 11 : His Pain Summary: Warning still applies. She is all he can taste now. When she had come, he had wiped his lips with his fingers, had sucked every drop of her from the creases in his skin. She has filled his head, and he still feels the need to kiss her. Kylo Ren always takes what he wants. He wants to take her, now. He covers her nude body entirely; he fits his cock at the juncture of her thighs. She is far too short for him. To reach her lips and neck, he must contort his torso. The discomfort can be ignored. The reward is great enough. Her wetness will ruin the fabric of his trousers, but he cannot bring himself to care. Kylo reaches between them, and she wets the back of his hand as tries to free his cock. He is hard and uncomfortable and it can only be sated by the soft, warm hug of her cunt. He stops when he feels her reach for buttons of his shirt, pulls at its hem, tugs at its collar. He is frustrated momentarily, before panic rises. He resists her every attempt to undress him. He must distract her. He presses opened mouthed kisses over her collar bones and her neck before returning to suck at her tongue. He can ignore his own cock for now. He rests his weight on one elbow, reaches with his hand beneath her to stroke and scratch along her back, trailing down her hips and the along seam of her ass to caress at the soft skin of her inner thighs. She tears away from his lips to moan when his fingers dip further down to touch at her soft folds. He returns to her sacrum, and pushes her up, hard against his groin. She has wet him enough that his trousers are hot and unpleasant against his skin. She melts in his arms. He has succeeded in his distraction. He goes for his fly. Then her voice cuts through with a plea. “Kylo, please, I need to feel your skin.” Kylo snarls, bucks himself up hard against her, to punish her for thwarting him yet again. That was a mistake. His body is shuddering, and he masters the urge to roar out his frustration. If she wants to feel his skin, then fine. He leans down to whisper in her ear, readies himself to pull away. “Let me turn out the light.” She is wrapping her legs around his waist as she begs. “No, please. I need to see you.” She has begun rolling against his desperate cock. Kylo can either stop his body from shuddering or stop his tears of frustration. He squeezes his eyes firmly shut. In the next instant, he is no longer on top. He is beneath her, being straddled. He is stunned, because he cannot quite remember how that had happened. His thoughts are extinguished when she rides him hard and fast through the placket of his trousers. Kylo is moaning like a bitch in heat and he hates himself. He turns his head away from her. He is helpless against the pleasure she forces onto his cock, winding him and taking away his fight. He presses back harder into the pillows, and grasps her thighs. He thrusts with her to chase the feeling. It is only when her hips suddenly stop, that he becomes aware of cold air hitting his sternum. He is startled, and he grasps her traitorous hands. He can feel her small bones crunch in protest, but cannot pay mind to that now. It was too late. She is already gasping in shock, and she has not seen the worst. He meets her gaze, and he cannot control the weakness in his voice. Three words. “Please, Rey. Don’t.” Kylo registers the pain in her gaze, and has the sense to release her hands. He has hurt her. He disgusts her. She no longer wants him. He will not lie here for that. He moves to raise himself up on his elbows. She pushes him back down. She slides against him again. She is slower this time, her eyes holding his, and he surrenders because it feels too good. His head is falling back, his eyes flutter. It has been a long time since he has allowed himself to be controlled in this way by another. Kylo lets her begin her task again. Even as he braces himself for her inevitable reaction. The front panels of his shirt are fully opened. She knows he is broken now. Despite her stimulation, he feels his useless cock wilt without ever having come. He sees in his mind’s eye, the marks – the destruction - left by others on his body. The hateful slashes, old and deep. The six puckered, ugly wounds on his side and on his chest that had narrowly missed his heart but had pierced and collapsed his lung, punched permanent holes in his body. He is ashamed, and goes to draw his shirt back over him, to shrink and hide away. He knows he has lost her now, he can hear his father’s voice, berating him when he was still no more than a boy. He can hear Bazine’s taunts as he lay dying at her feet. Sees the face of the hateful man who sired him. The cold-hearted bitch who abandoned him. The weak willed man who betrayed him. He has succumbed to weakness again. He wants to cry, he hates himself, because he already knew she made him weak. He is already mourning for the loss of her body against his. He feels hollow and bereft inside. But she does not move. He looks up, and her eyes are brimming with unshed tears. He thinks she knows his thoughts. “Oh, Kylo .” The sound of her voice breaks him. It is too much. It is her turn to push his hands away, to pry fabric aside until it frames his torso. He does not quite know what she means, but there is a pleading look in her eyes. Kylo finds himself under her control again, and this time, he thinks he does not mind it so much. She is kissing him. Three kisses reserved for each of the round wounds on his chest. She follows the vicious diagonal slash that trails from his shoulder to his hip. Her fingers are following the path set by her lips. He cannot feel anything from these scars. But he lets her do as she wills. She touches him through his trousers, she unzips him, reaches in. He feels fresh shame as she pulls his messy, limp cock from his pants, but she does not seem to care. She wraps her delicate fist around him, spreading his wetness before she pumps him. His cock fills again. He cries as she quickens her pace, and lightly digs her thumb into his slit. His mind blanks when he feels wet warmth envelop him, pushing into his cock unbearable pleasure between his legs and up his spine and in a tingling trail along the inside of his legs and feet. He is literally being fucked out of his mind. His helpless cock sears, his balls boil and his orgasm hurts. He is frightened because he cannot seem to stop cumming. His vision whites out before it goes to black. The last thought on his mind was of Rey. Chapter 12 : Pretty Woman When Kylo awakens, he does so with a start, uncertain how long he has slept for. He finds he is pinned to the bed, and when he looks down, he sees that Rey is laying on his chest, peering up at his face. She is smiling at him, a wide smile that makes him feel indulged, spoiled…wanted. “Relax, Kylo,” she soothes tracing patterns on his ruined skin, “you were only out for a few minutes.” It did not feel like a minute. He notices immediately that his genitals hang out from his opened trousers, that his disgustingly scarred chest is still uncovered. He shifts, untangles her from his body despite her protests. He is desperate to hide his torso again, turning his back to her to do so. He ignores the burning sensation he feels. He knows that she is staring at him. His trousers are completely ruined. The evidence of their pleasure has soaked within and without fabric. For some reason, that is what reignites and rankles the fire within him. When she speaks, she is unsure. “Kylo?” He does not answer her. “Kylo?” Her voice this time is sharper, and he winces. He feels her hands on his shoulders again. He feels the urge to sink back into her embrace, to kiss her and please her as he had done mere moments before. It takes a considerable amount of effort to resist his desire for her. He knows for certain now he had fooled himself into thinking that he can control himself around her. If he allows this to continue, the lesson is unlearned and he will fall again. He reaches to touch the three bullet wounds on his chest. He remembers the hotness of the iron, the sharpness of the stone ballast against his face, the icy water that diluted his blood and threatened to pull him into Hell. Bazine’s laughter rings in his ears like a shot in the dark. He will not survive death a third time. He makes the decision then. She must be excised, a cold sterile cut to cleave the poison and keep the pure. It is the only way. He straightens his back. His control returns and he is Kylo Ren, again. He shakes her off of him. “Get dressed, I will call the car.” “What?” “Get dressed. I will call the car.” He is harsher this time. He gets up, pads across the bedroom into his walk-in wardrobe. She is following him, she is naked under the long coat that she’d hastily pulled on, and she is upset. He ignores the feeling it stirs in his chest. “Kylo? Is because I took off your shirt when you said no?” Kylo takes in a sharp breath, despite himself. He purposefully leaves the closet door opened to shield himself from her as he slides into a clean shirt, a fresh pair of pants. He refuses to meet her eyes, brushing passed her to sit at the ottoman to the side of his bedroom. He pulls on a new pair of socks, and begins to slips his feet into his shoes. “Kylo. Is this because I took off your shirt when…?” “Yes!” He barks at her, surprising even himself that he had admitted even that much. He is already weakening again. He must make her leave. “Then can we… I don’t know… talk about it?” “No.” He stands up now that his shoes are tied. He does not bother to check himself in the mirror. “I will wait for you at the elevator.” ==================================================== He had actually slammed the door to his bedroom, shutting her in it. What on this great green earth? She is numb when she begins to pull on her underwear, her dress, her shoes, the clothes that he had so gently and passionately taken her out of before. She may not know what she had expected from tonight, but she knows for certain she did not expect this. The old gnawing feeling is back. He doesn’t look at her or talk or touch her at all on the elevator ride down to the main atrium. Rey recognizes some of staff manning the desk. She thinks they recognize her. She frets to think they knows what she and Kylo had been doing. She can barely keep up with him. His car is already waiting, and he pulls open the door with startling violence. He grabs her arm, firmly but not enough to hurt her, and seems almost too eager to push her into it. He doesn’t get in with her. As he goes to close the door, she grabs his hand. A silent plea on her face. When he looks at her, his soulful eyes waver and water for just a moment. The very next, they are cold and indifferent. Rey did not see the instant the change took place and is hit by the realization that the man before her is a complete stranger. He pries her from him, and slams the car door in her face. She feels each of his two loud knocks on the trunk of the car, making it shake with his strength. The car starts, and she watches as she is being driven away from Kylo. He simply turned on his heel and strode straight back into the atrium. ==================================================== The driver opens her car door when she is outside her building. He stands there for a long time out in the cold. At last, he gently prompts her. “Miss? We’ve arrived.” She looks up. Her eyes are dry, but she is on the verge of tears. “Thank you…” He smiles at her with sympathy. “Adam, my name is Adam.” “Thank you, Adam.” He offers her a gloved hand, helps her out of the car. She doesn’t look as he walks around the vehicle and climbs back into the driver’s seat. The car vrooms as it starts, and pulls out onto the empty street. The front gate feels especially heavy tonight, the climb up the stairs is long. She winces with each step because she can still feel the stickiness of his semen, and the pain left by his ardor, between her legs. The door opens before she even has her keys out. Finn stares at her with wide-eyes. Poe is at the kitchen table, glasses on, tapping on his laptop. “Hey, Pretty Woman. You’re home early.” Poe grins, pulling his glasses from his face, waggling his eyebrows. “How’d it go with the BFG?” It is then that Rey, for the first time since that desperate, lonely night in Jakku, when she had sworn she had shed her last tear, collapses into the tight embrace of her dearest friend, and falls with him onto the floor, soaking his hideous shirt with a new ugly pattern. Poe can only set his glasses down, and stare helplessly as Rey fell apart. Outside, Late Autumn yielded its first flurry of unseasonal snow. Chapter 13 : The Morning After She was born on the edge of a great, wide desert. Her mother, as a child, had once disappeared into it for three days. Everyone thought she was dead. Her grandmother, in her grief, did not eat nor drink nor sleep. For three days, she had prayed and paced the uneven floors of their tiny house. On the fourth day, her mother emerged, exhausted, lips parched, throat dry, but she was alive, and everyone rejoiced. She was called a miracle child. Someone took a photo of her grandmother crying happy tears to have her daughter safe in her arms once more. A moment in time frozen with the caption ‘miracle child home again.’ Her Poppy, Ben, kept that story alive, in the form of a creased, yellowed newspaper clipping he had pasted into a big, brown book, titled ‘memories.’ It contained all of the earthly reminders of the woman who had given birth to Rey, and who had died doing so. When the men in the blue hard-hats and the orange vests came, they threw many of Poppy’s things into a great, big fire. One of them was the memory book. Rey had never known her mother while she was still alive. It was on that day, she watched her mother die, her ashes curling up, up into the gradient blue of the endless Jakku sky. She missed the firm warmth of Poppy’s reassuring hands, felt a deep, gnawing pain grow beneath the tear-less numb she had wrapped herself in. And she finally realized she was truly alone. ==================================================== Rey woke up still wearing the dress she had worn for Kylo. She feels a solid heat at her back, and turns to find Finn asleep, face mashed against the wall, hugging a pillow he must have stolen from her at some point during the night. At the foot of her bed, Poe is snoring on her desk chair, chin on his chest, his arms crossed and his legs sticking out. Her bedroom is the one without the window, so she can’t quite tell what the time is. She quietly slides off the small, single bed and pulls the spare blanket out from under Finn’s feet and carefully drapes it over Poe. She doesn’t close her bedroom door all the way when pads barefoot out into the biting cool of the still kitchen. Her purse is still on the floor. Picking it up, she taps to rouse her phone. Thirty percent battery left, 5.47 am, no notifications. She puts the phone back in her purse, the purse on the kitchen table. There weren’t many words spoken last night, other than a broken, sobbed recount of how Kylo turned her out. She watched Finn breathe fire, becoming far too agitated and storming off into his bedroom with a slam, leaving Poe to pick up the pieces. When Finn came out again, he took her by her hand. She had cried when Finn led her to her bed, silently snuggled in next to her, bundled together like children afraid of the dark. It was just like he used to do when they lived in the overpriced dorms on the CU campus, when she first told him about why she had traveled across the country and left Niima Outpost and Jakku. There was nothing and no-one left for her out there, everything had been taken away. She was all alone in the world. "Hey, Peanut," he'd said, "I'm here. You're not alone anymore." It was one of the happiest moments of her life. The very next day, he told her he called her Peanut, because he had finally broken her out of her shell. Rey had someone. She had Finn, and when Poe had come in without a word, sat in her desk chair to take silent vigil, she realized that she had Poe too. Rey is all cried out now, there are no more tears to shed. Rey looks at the half-folded pile of clean laundry. Most likely abandoned when Rey had unceremoniously returned back home. She picks up a long-sleeve top, a pair of jeans, and heads into the bathroom. She catches sight of her own reflection, pauses and, setting down her clean clothes, turns to face the mirror. Rey stares at her swollen face, her red-rimmed, dark-circled eyes, and she thinks of Kylo. When she finally held him in her hand, tears fell from the corners of his eyes. They had kept falling when she took him inside of her and when he came apart too quickly beneath her. He was a broken mess, his face contorted, his scarred body writhing. She remembered thinking at that moment, can’t you see you’re beautiful too? His weak plea cuts through like a knife. Please, Rey. Don’t. Rey turns from the mirror, drops her dress and twists the shower taps. The pipe in the wall starts banging, and the shower begins sputtering, spewing to a start. She steps in, closing the frosted glass door behind her, and begins the task of washing the lingering remnants of Kylo from her skin. Chapter 14 : Honorable Senators and Council Members Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) “Good morning.” He’d greeted. And…nothing. Luke could almost feel the ooze of contempt radiating towards him. Luke watched the Senate District council member’s overly-tailored back retreating away. Luke was used to the casual dismissal of his fellow council members. He was the odd little hermit professor from a small town far, far away who suddenly cracked into their sacred Coruscant City Hall. But for Luke to be outright ignored was something else all together. Over the last few weeks, he had been suspecting something was different, but now he downright knew - he just didn’t quite know what that something was. Luke wasn’t intentionally the sneaky type. He found himself sneaking as he followed the Senate District council member, slowing his pace behind as they turned a corner and entered their office suite. He could hear the council member barking orders. “…and hold all calls, cancel all afternoon appointments. I have somewhere to be. Keep it off the official schedule.” As Luke peered in the office, the council member’s frumpy assistant appeared, shot him a dirty look and pointedly closed the door in his face. Yes, something was very different. He continued on his way, lost in thought as he headed towards his own office further down the hall. His own assistant looked up from her computer with a warm smile. Luke felt as if his heart just did a little burp. “Good morning, Mara.” “Good morning, council member.” Luke gently set down one of take-out cups he was holding onto the corner of her desk. “Here you go – nonfat latte, one sugar.” She smiled appreciatively. “That’s very sweet of you, council member. But I hope you aren’t trying to say anything my coffee-making skills.” Luke felt warm from his fingers to his toes. “Never,” he swore. He took a sip of his own tea as he headed into his office. As he was cracking open the door, he heard Mara get up from her seat. He set down his worn leather briefcase, and reached into his tweed jacket and pulled out his reading glasses to slide onto his nose. “Is my schedule looking scary enough for you, Mara?” He asked lightly, picking up a memo from one of the stacks of paper on his desk. Mara was swiping at the tablet on her arm. “Actually, it’s mostly empty, council member.” Luke was stunned, his jaw actually dropped. “But…can I see…?” Mara turned her tablet towards him, her index and thumb making motions like a crab’s claw. “Pinch it to zoom in,” she said. Once, Mara had laughed saying that he was an old fuddy-duddy. Luke had joked she was no spring chicken either. Luke regretted it as soon as he saw Mara’s face fall. Had he been the kind of man to do so, he would have apologized with flowers, but instead Luke had simply allowed the joke to fizzle out until it was forgotten. Luke dropped the memo on his desk, and taking the tablet from her hands, did as she had instructed. Empty. Just as she’d said. “Didn’t we have these meetings scheduled last week? What happened?” “I’m not sure, council member.” Mara said, gently, “voicemail was full when I arrived this morning. All of them were cancellations from your colleagues.” Ignoring Mara’s disapproving tsk, Luke casually flung the tablet onto his desk. as he sank heavily into his chair. He slowly pulled his reading glasses off his face to pinch at the bridge of his nose. His question, rhetorical, was directed to nothing by air. “What is going on ?” ==================================================== “What…is…going…ON?” “Mr Hux. Mr Ren is very busy. I can put you on his schedule…” “Fuck his schedule! And fuck Mr Ren! Let me in, I’m a fucking EVP of this company and…” “Please stand back, Mr Hux, or I will personally escort you out!” Kylo had stopped poring over rough plans and artist’s impressions to take enjoyment from the snapping and snarling outside of his office. It amused him, but now that the confrontation appeared to be drawing to its conclusion, he reached out a long finger, and pressed a button on the intercom. “Phasma. Let Armitage in.” The voice that came back, normally as cool and calm as his, held an edge of irritation. “Yes, sir.” Kylo resumed his previous posture, leaning over his desk with his arms braced wide. His office had sliding doors, meaning that they could not be slammed, but Armitage still entered as if he were a tiny tornado. His angry strides lost their intended impact as he crossed the vast space between the doors and Kylo’s desk. “Kylo! What the fuck is happening in the conference room? There at least forty city and state officials waiting in there right now.” Kylo straightened up, and lifted his sleeve to note the time. He was pleased. “They have arrived ahead of schedule.” “Ahead of what schedule ?” Kylo finally turned to eye Armitage. He waited until realization dawned on the red-headed imp. “You don’t mean… no…” He allowed himself to smirk. “Yes.” “Really? You mean to do that today? I thought that you’d…” Kylo was on the move and no longer listening. He retrieved suit jacket from where it hung and shrugged it on as he strode out of his office. He went to stand before the elevator, fixing his cuffs so that they fell below his sleeves, buttoning his jacket closed. Phasma had already gathered all the necessary documents and was standing beside him. When the elevator arrived, Armitage squeezed in first. Kylo, irritated, nonetheless chose to ignore him. He looked up, watching as the elevator display panel dutifully scrolled off descending numbers. “My department has only just completed the risk assessment and you are already lodging a proposal?” Armitage hissed. “I am merely gauging their interest.” “You haven’t called a meeting before the full board.” Kylo rumbled a dark laugh. “I am the board.” Armitage was seething, hissy and sparking like a livewire with its casing split. “No, you only provisionally represent 85% of the board. And if you pull a stunt like this, I swear you will represent a lot less. Wait until father hears about it, he will…” Kylo finds that of late, he has been short on patience. Armitage’s smugness must be addressed. Kylo struck quickly. He shot out an arm to grab a fistful of Armitage’s tie, then callously shoved him hard. Armitage collided with a sickening smack against the wall, juddering the elevator. While he stumbled to right himself, Kylo reared up on him, snarling as he caged the slightly shorter man in with his much larger, stronger body. When Armitage looked up, his expression was one of shock and utter terror. Kylo had never struck his adopted brother before. But there was something immensely satisfying about it, on a primal level, to physically dominate him. He wonders if it might become a new habit. Kylo’s voice was a low growl. “For your sake, Armitage, I suggest you desist.” Cowed, Armitage could only nod. Kylo pulled back slowly, ignoring Armitage as he slumped against the wall, panting. Kylo’s gaze returned to the panel, he fixed his cuffs once more. Armitage was shaking as he pushed himself up from the wall, face red with humiliation. His hands could not stop trembling as he tried to straighten his tie, push his shock of sweaty red hair back from his forehead. He wiped his palms down his front. His next snipe was weak as a whimper from a wounded animal. “Do…do not let your personal interests interfere with the interests of the company, Kylo.” No, not a snipe, then. He was pleading. Kylo only laughed. From the corner of his eye, he could see Phasma mask a snicker. The elevator doors opened. Flanked by his assistant and his brother, Kylo Ren strode forth boldly. He could see that the conference room – encased entirely by large glass windows – was stuffed full of greedy, milk-fattened dignitaries, partaking freely in his hospitality. The door to the conference room was opened for him, and rather than shaking hands, slapping backs and asking after families, Kylo assumed his rightful place at the head of the long, dark-wood table. He cast his gaze across the sea of faces, waited as they fell silent one by one. He pulled the microphone closer. Into the hush, he released the seed of an idea that had rooted in his mind a decade ago. When he realized that only his father's great work could bring order to the chaos, more swiftly and permanently than any tedious debate and endless bureaucracy. Only he had the power to re-order the world, literally from the ground up. “The heart of the Republic is dying,” he declared, “and only First Order Enterprises can save it.” He could feel the room, politely silent, was now stunned. Yes, yes, this is what he wanted. Father, he thinks, I will finish what you started. “Honorable Senators and Council Members, let me talk to you about the district of Takodana…” Notes: General Hux's name is Armitage, which is why we have a name change. Chapter 15 : The Snoke Mansion Summary: Dinner at daddy dearest's Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Three days. Three days since he had stunned the ruling class of Coruscant. He feels triumphant. He has been here before. In this seat, at this dinner. His father sits unashamedly at the head of the table. He and Armitage have been dispersed amongst their many dinner guests. His father was wise. This way, they could spread their influence further, divide and conquer. He does not recognize the woman to his right, which is odd. Kylo Ren rarely finds himself unfamiliar with the guests chosen to dine at this father’s table. She hasn’t at all been interested in eating. Throughout the night, he could tell she wanted to play a game. Perhaps that is why his father has chosen to place her at his side. Nothing his father does is by accident. She is blonde, hair short in a fashionably severe cut, draped in dark navy, her dress designed to hide and tantalize. She is running her finger along a line of sapphires and diamonds at her throat when she turns to speak to him, icy blue eyes daring him to look away. He does dare, returning to the dessert course, he listens to the idle chatter of the important senator on his left. She waited until the senator disengages to make her move, catches his attention by touching his knee. He leans, lowers his ear towards her, eyes still looking at the table. “Your plans are very ambitious, Mr Ren.” And so it begins. He answers nonchalantly, not bothering to throw her a glance. “I do nothing by half-measures. Neither does my father.” “It’s not a caution, Mr Ren. Takodana has always been an eyesore. Hideous crime rates, poverty. Such a waste. Frankly, I am an admirer of your work.” Fabric rustles as she slides closer, her hand on his shoulder, her breathy whisper conspiratorial, “SRH Property has been making significant investments in Takodana in recent years. A subsidiary of yours, yes?” Kylo reaches for the sauternes, the chosen pairing, pulling away from her slightly. He feels her hand slide from his shoulder to his hip before she withdraws from him completely. He sips. “You’ve been doing your homework, Miss…?” “Missus. Though I’d rather you not know my name yet, Mr Ren.” He finally looks at her. “You know mine. You seem to know a lot about me.” She smiled, re-crossed her legs under the table so that her knee was now nudging him. “Everything that I need to know is on the public record, right, Mr Ren?” His eyes narrow at her response. “So it seems.” She is within his space again. Her hand glides to a rest on his inner thigh, hidden by the table linens. She trails in closer, and he fights the urge to hiss. “Be careful, Missus. Your husband would not approve.” Her lips graze his ear this time. “You are assuming that I need his approval, Mr Ren.” “Do you not?” “I doubt he would very much mind.” “I see.” He pauses, his eyes dart towards where his father sat. Though his father is not looking, he knows his father still sees everything. Kylo scans the grand dining room, finally noticing what he needs to. One man, middle-aged, groomed to within an inch of his life in an effort to impress, appears entirely too intrigued with their exchange. Ah, yes. Kylo knows him. A third-generation sort with no legacy of his own. Important enough to be invited, but not important enough to considered special. Kylo settles in now, more certain than before, his voice wavers between dulcet and cool. “What exactly are the terms of this negotiation?” She stiffens slightly, before melting into him once more. He has to admire her tenacity. “I want in. I want in, Mr Ren, and in exchange,” her lips brush his ear, her finger rubs his covered cock, “you can get in me .” He pulls himself from her grasp. Pushes his chair out. He meets Armitage’s eyes, on the way out from the dining room, watches as his brother takes notice of the woman in blue before he nods slightly. She discretely gets up to follow him. There is a drawing room down the darkened hall. Not intended to be used by guests tonight. He leads, she follows. He pins her against the wall as soon as she closes the door and swathes them in dark. He turns her around without ceremony, pushing her face against the wood panel as he lifts her dress and pulls her panties down to her knees. He tests her, finds her already wet. She was far too invested in this game. “You’ll have to tell me you name, Missus.” He growls against her ear. “How else will I draw up the contracts?” “Afterwards, Mr Ren.” “No,” he is unzipping himself, his cock leaves a wet trail down the back of her bare thighs, “tell me now.” She moans when he licks a stripe up the back of her neck. “Castillo,” she breathes, pressing back against him now. “Reyna Castillo.” “Rey…” he freezes. Immediately. He jerks away and zips himself up. His interest in the game snuffed out like a glass over a candle. She turns around, confused. “Kylo…?” The sound of his own name enrages him. “Pull your panties up, Mrs Castillo. Have your husband call my assistant. If we are to negotiate, he will do so like a grown man.” He doesn’t care what she does now. He is already gone. He thunders upstairs to the private gallery. He can here house staff scurrying away. Good. He didn’t both to switch on a light, the full moon fills the gallery with blue and white. He strides until stands before the great gothic window, the one that had always made him feel kingly. He can see the ocean beyond the tree-line. Rey… He has been successful in ignoring her for the past three days, since their…encounter. Now that she is again saturating his thoughts, he feels deep resentment pounding behind his sternum. Towards her, towards himself for still wanting her, desiring her, needing her. It is a madness he had not felt since his father had set Bazine Netal on his trail. “Please, Rey. Don’t” “I shall see to it that you are loyal. She shall be my eyes, my ears…you will have no secrets from me, my son.” Loyalty. Devotion. Submission. “Yes, father.” Crystal shatters. A thousand tiny pieces glint from the plush Persian rug. Kylo Ren remains unsated. He stands still for the longest time. ==================================================== He is still standing when the room is bathed in light. He hears the creaking-grind of metal on metal. “Armitage, leave us.” “Yes, father.” The door whispers to a close. “My son.” The words are slurred, ill formed, the product of a tongue that no longer obeys, a lip that is permanently loose. It is muscle memory that brings him to turn, to walk towards his father with his head bowed and to sink to his knees. He flinches at the feel of his father’s skeletal hand as it touches his cheek. He looks up. His father is so very old now, looks more so since the stroke two years ago that left the prideful man infirm and bound to a wheelchair. The right side of his face droops. His thick, white hair is long gone, there is nothing but a few unruly wisps on his pate. He is paler than pale, scattered with age spots and creased and lined and paper-thin. But his father has not diminished. He remains. He is strong. His father places his hand on Kylo’s crown. Kylo allows his head to drop, his cheek against his father’s sharp knee. He closes his eyes, and waits for his father’s instruction. When it comes, it sends chills down his spine. “Kylo Ren,” his father grates, “speak.” ==================================================== “Kylo Ren. Speak.” The hush that falls and fills the room is a loud and rushing sigh. His father’s knee is a point of pain against his cheekbone, and Kylo is compelled to focus upon it. He sighs, his body grows lax, his mind wanders. He is no more than a little boy again. A scene blooms from black, slowly gaining edges and color. An old, neatly bearded man in an overly large, ill-fitting jacket. Saunters as if he owned the place. The old man suddenly stops, stands off to the side, watches with a pathetic, pious smile on his lips as the interviewer flips though notes with her producer. The old man raises the back of his hand to his mouth, a soft ahem, and the interviewer turns. She throws opens her arms, greets him as an old friend, laughs at his little joke. She clings to the old man as the producer reaches over to shake his hand. As Kylo watches this memory, he balls his fists, clenches his jaw. Deep knowing boils in his gut. “Speak.” His voice has lost its strength, its firmness. A hurt, almost childish warble issues from his teeth. “I saw him. That church elder. San Tekka.” A pause. A prompt. “Where?” “Monday. Interview.” Kylo lets out a petulant growl, his nails bite flesh. “He came to use her against me.” His father hums a monotonous note. “You succeeded against him.” At the sound of his father’s approval, he calms. His breath slows. His mind goes black again. The silence stretches. His father breaks it. “And what of Takodana?” Takodana. The image shifts and Kylo sees it, as it is now, as it was then. The cracked pavement, the mortar-less brick. Porous, buckling pipes and erratic color sprayed on moldy concrete. Worn old shoes, tied, tossed over telephone wires. Bisecting alleyways, dark and damp with putrid water, an ominous smell of rats and piss. He hates it. His vehement fury was no hard-sell. It was truth. That place was a cesspit, a deep, dank hole. A bottomless well of misery and pain that had harbored and nurtured that hateful man …Han Solo. This place was a point in a series, of a legacy Kylo Ren sought to erase, a legacy he had chased, and razed to the ground by the power of earth-moving machines. Oh, how he would destroy, destroy, destroy. And yet…and yet… He is suddenly without weight, drifting, boneless. Startled, he screws his eyes tighter, his brows furrows, he struggles. A cold night. His hands buried his in pockets, shivering from the biting chill and from anticipation. A heavy metal gate clangs open. A single flower grows in Takodana, and it is beautiful. His furious clarity wavers, goes, evaporating to nothing with that final, haunting, longing thought. He opens his eyes, dazed and conflicted, and lifts his head from his father’s knee. The parquet beneath him creaks as he braces to push himself up from the floor. He avoids his father’s gaze. There is brandy. It is kept on the mantle in a monogrammed decanter. Tribute from some senator grateful for a favor granted. A.S. His father’s initials. It is a permanent fixture, always filled with clear, amber liquid. Even though his father could no longer stand to reach it, let alone drink it. The stopper is stuck from disuse; it pulls away only with effort. Kylo pours himself a large snifter, drains it in one gulp. He grimaces at the flat, weak taste. The liquor has been ruined by light, had been left untouched for far too long. It does not give him what he sought. The unanswered question still lingers. His father’s scrutiny is too much to bear. Kylo talks, swift words to the dregs at the bottom of the emptied glass. “The Takodana project was well-received, father. Our political allies have been instructed to begin mobilizing. Investment partners are already presenting themselves for consideration. I expect to make formal announcements within a month.” His father narrows one eye, reaches up to wipe the spittle from his chin. His father is suspicious and he knows. Kylo feels as if his father knocking, tapping and testing along the welding of his faults and chinks. Kylo’s need for approval overwhelms him. His voice is smaller than he had intended. “I will not fail you, father.” His father is the menacing whisper of the dark; and he holds vengeful promises in this tone. “We shall see, my son. We shall see.” Notes: To all the 163 kudo-ers, a heartfelt thank you! Chapter 16 : Andui General Luke had just seen Mara to her car, was brushing snow off of his windscreen when his cellphone rings. He pulls it out, squints at the screen. When he finally answers, he is little disappointed, but only because he had been expecting another call that still has not come. “Hello, Poe?” “Luke!” The panic rattles the young man’s voice. Luke snaps to attention. “You have to come, right away.” “Hold on, Poe. Calm down. Where do you want me to go?” Luke demands. “Andui General. It’s Maz. She’s in emergency.” Luke is yanking at his car door, bangs his head against the frame. His seatbelt won’t budge from its mount. But his slightly pained, gentle voice carries authority. “Poe, I’m coming, right now. Keep your phone on you, at all times. Understand?” Poe’s voice is a little shaky. “Yes.” The cold engine sputters, finally turns. “I will be there in about forty-five minutes. Alright?” “Alright. Please, hurry.” Luke drives perhaps a little too fast. He clenches his steering wheel the whole way. ==================================================== Luke saw him from the crowded line into the emergency room. Poe is pacing like a puppy left alone all day. He’s practically hopping foot to foot as Luke inches forward. Luke stands still, allows himself to be scanned by the metal detector. The security guard nods, and Luke gathers his belongings. Poe already turned to lead before Luke has caught up. “How is she?” Luke asks as he follows. “They wouldn’t talk to me, because I’m not family. Then I was waiting for you. I don’t know what’s going on.” “Is anyone with her?” Luke demanded. “Rey - she apparently lied to the paramedic and said Maz was her nan…but I think she left her cell at Maz’s house. She hasn’t called.” Luke grimaces, weaves his way with muttered “excuse mes” through the packed waiting room. As they near the nurses’ station, he sees that the boy, Finn, has carved out a little niche nearby. When he reaches the nurses station, the nurse doesn’t look up from her monitor. “Hello, I’m Maz Kanata’s …son. Can I see her?” The nurse frowns, taps away as if she is ignoring hm. Luke is about to ask again when she speaks. “She has been moved to a ward, sir. Building B, Level 4, South Ward 3, Room 3A, Bed 7.” Luke almost reels at the barrage and he repeats after the nurse again and again until the string of words and numbers is memorized. His thank you is said in passing as he and the boys chase colored lines and stark blue and white signs towards their destination. Another nurse glares as them as they approach South Ward 3. “Only two visitors per patient. Your daughter’s already in there.” She says after Luke asks for Maz. She points to a row of chairs off to the side. A hushed conversation, and Poe finally nods, concedes. “You go in first, Luke. Get us when you’re ready.” ==================================================== Murmurs and steady beeping. The ward is almost subdued. There is a man nearby, moaning. A deep, mournful, guttural moan. Luke couldn’t tell where the man was. It didn’t matter anyway. Room 3A. He slips in behind the curtain of Bed 7. Luke’s humming panic dampens when he sees Maz is peacefully snoring. The lights have been dimmed, and the overhead lamp is turned away from Maz’s face. She’s hooked up to an IV, but not much else. The girl, Rey is there, messy hair stuck to her forehead, thick sweater slightly damp. But she is alert, stalwart, her eyes firm, her lips pressed. She’s holding onto Maz’s hand. Luke shifts his coat in his arms. His whisper-tone careful. “She’s asleep?” The girl turns to look at him, and gives a tight nod. “Yeah.” “What happened? Rey’s voice is a hushed whisper. She tells of how Maz had been calling in sick for the past week. How tonight, she hadn’t called in, how Unkar didn’t tell anyone until Rey had made a spontaneous comment. Rey had tried to call Maz’s house after that, but no one had answered. “So Finn and I took a cab over there,” Rey said, “I saw her through her window, passed out on the floor. We called the paramedics.” It was sudden inspiration that caused Rey to blurt out she was Maz’s granddaughter when Finn tried to push his way into the back of the ambulance and was forced back. “Did they say what’s wrong?” Asked Luke. Rey shakes her head. As if on cue, the curtain is pulled back, and a tired-looking young doctor appears, vague surprise on his face. “Mr Kanata?” Luke stands from where he had been sitting. “No…I mean yes. I’m Luke Kanata. This is my daughter, Rey. How is Maz…za.” The doctor looks suspiciously at him, then shrugs as he reaches for the chart at the end of Maz’s bed. “Mr Kanata, I wasn’t able to get much information about your mother from your daughter. Perhaps you can assist me.” “I’m not sure I can.” Luke hesitates. “Can you tell me what happened?” “She likely hasn’t been eating much – likely due to nausea from her active infection. When your daughter found her, your mother’s blood sugar was dangerously low.” Luke glances at Maz’s light, delicate form. He doesn’t like the doctor’s tone, he speaks as if he’s hinting something. ”Just low blood sugar and an infection, then, right?” “No, not quite. Her blood sugar is stabilised now. She’s being given acetaminophen to manage the fever. A few more hours of observation, and she can go home. However, I recommend that she stays on at least until the gastroenterologist has a chance to see her tomorrow.” The doctor’s stern voice is kinder now. “Mr Kanata, your mother exhibits possible signs of early liver failure.” Rey makes an almost squeaking gasp. Luke and the doctor both glance at her in surprise. She says nothing. The doctor continues, “your mother is very tired. I’ll leave her to rest. But, please. Try to convince her to stay when she wakes up. Call the nurse to let us know.” Luke nods. “Thank you, doctor. I’ll try my best.” ==================================================== Poe and Finn were with Maz now. The question “have you eaten” was rendered pointless by Rey’s loud tummy grumble. The cafeteria was long closed by now. The dining area was still opened, though. No hot meal tonight, vending machines it was, then. Luke looked with slight dismay at the nearly-empty shelves. Oh well. Pulling out a handful of coins, Luke slots them in, one by one, before he makes his selections. He comes away with a couple of sandwiches and candy bars. Rey was put in charge of getting them thick, stale machine coffee. She’d already parked herself on one of the cleaner tables. Paper wrappers and plastic bottles having been piled onto a tray that had been left behind. She pushes one of the coffees towards him as Luke ambles towards her, a sandwich in each hand. “I’ve got egg-salad and tuna fish.” He says, once he’s sat down, raising each sandwich slightly to show her. She points to the egg-salad and he sets it down before her, smiling as she carefully breaks the seal on the container. He pulls out a couple of Big Hunks from his jacket pocket. Her eyes go wide. He’s almost defensive as he explains. “I’m an old guy. I like fuddy-duddy candy.” She doesn’t reply, but is smiling to herself as she reached for one of the candy bars. She flips it over in her hands to read the wrapper. “Big Hunk,” she almost gushes, “I haven’t had one of these in ages.” “Nougat is my favorite,” Luke confesses, “and smashing them has been my main method of stress relief for years.” “They’re an oldie but a goodie.” Rey replies. Luke thinks she might be quoting someone. He is abandoning his sandwich now. He picks up the other candy bar, catches her eye. They grin as they both raise their hands up together at the same time. “On three, kid.” He jokes, drawling like a Tatooine ol’ timer. Rey freezes, her hand falls slowly back down; then she’s cradling the candy bar in her hands. Luke worries he’s said something wrong, but then she’s laughing. Out loud. “Did I say something…” “No, no.” She smiles fondly at the candy, before looking up at him. Her Jakku accent is slightly more noticeable now. “It’s just, that’s what my Poppy used to say whenever we shared a Big Hunk.” Her eyes glisten, her smile falls a bit. Her confession is raw. “I miss him.” Luke doesn’t quite know what to say, afraid he’ll poke the old wound rather than comfort. He sits still, feeling ineffective. Suddenly, she reaches across the table, and squeezes his forearm. “Thanks for being here when we needed you, Luke.” She smiles. A fresh wave of paternal protectiveness sweeps over him. “You kids are very welcome.” He replies. They eat in companionable silence. ==================================================== “We got kicked out.” Poe says by way of explanation. “Visiting hours are over.” Adds Finn. There is no protest this time as Luke leads them out through the snow flurry towards his car. When Luke pulls up outside their building, he’s watching as they pile out. Finn is the one tackling the heavy metal gate. Rey turns around to catch Luke’s eye. She gives him a little wave as he pulls away. Luke responds in kind. As he heads back towards his lonely apartment, Luke sees his cell phone light up from its cradle. A notification flashes. It's the message he's been waiting for. Text Message: Tomorrow night. Hotel Bar. 7:00pm. Chapter 17 : Hotel Bar and an Envelope Finn had blown off Poe’s incredibly attractive offer to go into the city to see his tiny office ‘workstation.’ To maybe go for fish tacos and afterwards, maybe even catch a movie. Instead, Finn had chosen to accompany Rey to visit Maz at Andui General Hospital. They had gone immediately after their lectures had finished. Maz, however, had seemed less anxious to see them. True to her style, in less than twenty-four hours, Maz had managed to browbeat the nurses, doctors and even her fellow patients into submission, after they’d made the mistake of trying to cajole and baby talk what they’d thought was a frail, helpless old woman. Maz also didn’t stand for Rey and Finn trying to fuss around her – fluffing her pillow, offering a hand to help her back onto the bed, pushing her tray table closer to her… “Don’t you fuss around me,” she’d said again, slapping at Finn’s hands because he dared to lift the plastic cover from over her plate, “I’ve lived longer than all of you children. The doctors will take care of me. Now get outta my hair and let an old woman rest. Oh, and tell Unkar not to burn down my cantina!” “Rey won’t see him until tomorrow, though.” Finn complained, rubbing the smart from his hands. “Then tell him tomorrow,” Maz had sighed at the obviousness of it all, “go on, children. Before it snows.” With those words, Finn and Rey had been shooed from the ward. But not without a firm cheek kiss for the both of them. Maz didn’t volunteer anything about what the doctor had said. Rey wasn’t going to pry. She’d hope that Maz’s fire meant that she was going to be ok. ==================================================== Back at their apartment, stuffed full of boxed mac and cheese, Rey had decided to make a concentrated effort on her paper. She’d put on her comfy sweatshirt, settled down with a couple of cans of caffeinated orange soda and an iron will. This was it, thanksgiving recess was next week. The term paper was due straight after that. It was do or die. Except. Finn. Rey groaned as the volume on the TV seemed to be getting louder and louder. She’d tried to ignore it – at first. Even gotten up to slam the door, hoping he would take the hint. But it wasn’t working. Grabbing her earphones, she stomped out of her bedroom. She grabbed his phone from the kitchen table on the way. “Finn!” She half-pleaded, half-yelled. “Please, please, please turn down the volume! I’m trying to finish my paper!” Finn looked up, slightly dazed, with an apologetic grin, and began to forage among the papers he’d strewn all over the floor and coffee table. “Shit, sorry, Peanut. You know that background noise helps me study.” Rey rolled her eyes, and after wordlessly tossing him his cell, joined in on the search for the remote. She eventually found it underneath the coffee table. Beeping music suddenly filled the apartment. The theme for Current Affairs. Finn was watching Current Affairs. Rey rolls her eyes again, switches off the TV. “You weren’t even watching anything good, Finn.” “If I was watching something good, I wouldn’t be able to study.” Rey pressed earphones into his hands. “Just use these, ok?” Finn at least managed to look sheepish. “Sure thing, Peanut.” Rey retreated to her room before her bossy façade melted. She slammed the door for good measure. ==================================================== 7.00 pm. Hotel Bar. The modest chain hotel sits only a few blocks away from the Coruscant City Hall. It took no time to get there at all. Luke had arrived right on time, but as he had expected, he was already being waited upon. He could recognize the man immediately, sitting at the bar with his back straight and his head held still. Just as he was when Luke had first met him all those years ago. Luke sighed, feeling a slight apprehension as he approached. They had not parted on the best of terms. Their eyes met through the mirror behind the behind the rows of liquor. When the man turned around, Luke was struck by how old he looked. Although , Luke thought, a little dolefully, I’m not exactly young anymore, either . The man was already sliding off of his barstool, pulling at his jacket to straighten it. With three or four paces left to go, Luke stuck out his hand, a grim smile on his face. His tone even, unsure how this meeting would go. “Elder San Tekka.” An eyebrow was raised in question. “Professor Skywalker. Or, should I say, Council Member Skywalker.” Luke shook his head. “Just call me Luke.” San Tekka nods slowly, gestures to the bar stool beside him, “come, please sit.” Once sat down, they both stared straight ahead, hands clasped together, silent. It was Luke who finally spoke, “what are you doing in Coruscant, Lor?” “There was an annual church convention,” Lor supplied, breakingly, hesitantly, “and I’ve come to see old friends…among other reasons.” He slowly turned to face Luke. “I have some news. It is rather distressing. I have contemplated not telling you. But I could not in good conscience keep it from you, no matter what our personal differences are.” Luke glances at him, before looking down at the bar. For the first time, he notices the string-button envelope lying neatly under San Tekka’s hands. He looks up questioningly. His apprehension is growing. “What is it, Lor?” San Tekka looked away, gestured to the bartender. Luke cannot even begin to react to the sight of the teetotaler clumsily ordering a drink. Once supplied, San Tekka drinks deep, grimaces at the taste of the alcohol. Without looking at Luke at all, San Tekka gingerly slid the envelope towards Luke. He is at once sorrowful. “I am sorry, Luke.” He says. “I truly am. I know that despite everything, he was still your friend.” Luke is quick to unloop the string, pulling out the piece of paper. It takes no more than a passing glance for his blood to run cold. He quickly slides the paper back in, fastens the envelope again. His normally soft voice is hard. “I hope you don’t have anything planned tonight, Lor, because you are coming with me.” San Tekka sighed, resigned. “I had hoped this would be enough.” “No.” Luke insisted, pulling out his cell phone, “it isn’t.” He presses in a memorized number, holds the phone against his ear. He hears the dial-tone, waits for the inevitable click. When she answers, she sounds weary and warning. It wasn’t the time to be delicate. San Tekka orders another drink. Chapter 18 : A Child Must Be Taught Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) He had started off so…unpromising. Nothing more than an irregular, tall, lanky waif, no thicker than a hickory switch. Unprincipled, undisciplined, reckless, feckless…useless. To think that he had in his veins the blood of one of the greatest political dynasties of the Republic was – simply put – a joke. The ‘dad’ was a mistake, weak and foolish, and thankfully no longer a concern. The mother was…inadequate, but she had seemed worthy - at first, had been of use - for a while. Pity. Had she been more amenable… Her meddling and her corruption has long since been plucked out. She had been shrewd, wily, but the child... Ah, the child. The poor, pathetic child. He had to be taught. Repeat after me. Loyalty. Devotion. Submission. Loyalty. Devotion. Submission. One must always start slow - little corrections. At first. A sudden tap on the knuckles. Sit straight! Do not eat before I eat, listen when I speak, do not talk back to me, sit up straight – uh, uh, uh! Learn to be a gentleman. Always say please, excuse me, thank you, sir… Transgressions must be dealt with swiftly - little punishments. At first. Enough to show your displeasure, enough to make him draw back his little hand and yip in hurt, but not enough to alarm the mother. Never enough to scare the child - or the mother - away. Little treats. Coax the child back after he licks his wounds, dangle before him the faintest, tiniest morsel. But remind him, you do not deserve this, it is only by my grace. A little kindness, but never, ever a reward. Remember, it is by my grace, I grant you this. See, dear boy, how kind I can be when you obey? Then one day. Yes, he will say. I will obey. The child is then ready, and you can begin. That man, ‘dad’ , was not a father. Look how he disappointed you . I shall give you a new name, and I will forge you with new purpose. Your worth is tied to my good opinion. I shall call you son, and you shall call me father. Look, see, my son, what you can become? Not an anchor-less ship, sail unfurled and rudder chain broken. At the mercy of the tireless storm of chaos. No, see – your purpose is greater. Order. Stability. Safety. That is your purpose, that is your fate. I am your father. A good son must obey his father. …yes, father. And that is how it is done. For each crack, push. For each inch, take. Do not let him falter, do not let him weaken. Remember. Repeat. Loyalty. Devotion. Submission. Loyalty. Devotion. Submission. To no one else but me. Notes: Thanks to all readers, bookmarkers, commentators, kudoers, subscribers... I have a lab report to write, but this is just so much more fun. :) Chapter 19 : Current Affairs Notes: The structure of Current Affairs is a little bit different from previous chapters, because a lot more is going on than usual. I think I'm happy with it now, but let me know if it doesn't make sense to you and I'll try and fix it. Thanks for your support! Beeping theme music starts… Leia looks up from the thick, spiral bound draft report draped across her knees. She sets her snifter of brandy - an acquired habit she has yet to break - down onto the side-table. The draft report is slid over onto the spot beside her and she settles herself deeper into the Louis XVI style couch. She normally doesn’t watch television, but her undivided attention turns to the scene that unfolds before her. …a sea of angry protestors. An army of demolition excavators. A crying woman clutching her confused and tearful children. Picket signs and banners. A family stands among ruins, tossed out by hard-hat wearing men… She has too many late nights, too many early mornings. Too much preparation required for senate committees, legislative sessions…there is so much to do. When sleeping and eating is an inconvenience, leisure time became a sin. …the Jakku State Capitol Building. Except…this was important. Right now, watching the Current Affairs program with Annabelle Hayes on CSBN is the most important thing Leia can do. An exclusive interview. An interview in response to last week’s one-hour special. They’d been advertising it for a week. Not that she cared a scrap about the content. She knew it would hold for her uncomfortably close brushes with the truth. This is the only way she gets to see her son now. …he is climbing down the steps of the Capitol, surrounded by a posse of suited guards. The picture zooms and freezes. His impassive expression fills the screen. And there he is. Always through a barrier, always filtered - in a one-sentence quote from news source, a candid shot from a long-range lens - in a curt, distant, polite greeting at one of the many events in the Coruscant social calendar. (Even when she’s standing right in front of him, she’s always on the periphery. He doesn’t do her the courtesy of small-talk, skilled as he is at shutting people down. Leia has to smile. He gets that from her. Her son is more like her than he cares to admit.) Annabelle Hayes stares directly out from the screen. “…the current Acting President and the Senior Executive Vice President of First Order Enterprises. Thank you for agreeing to be here,” Annabelle says, turning to face him now, “you’re not known for granting interviews.” His smile is guarded, just like his reply. “Everything that needs to be known is already on the public record.” Leia almost barks a laugh. She’s heard that reply from him often enough. She also knows that it’s a lie. What she knows about him, the things that aren’t on the public record, could fill a novel. His hair is longer. Probably trying to hide his big ears. His hair came from her. Those ears were not her fault. “…but you have to admit that there are legitimate concerns.” Annabelle taps her pen against the clipboard on her lap. “Your projects effectively price-out vulnerable families from their own communities.” “I would contest that. Our projects correspond to increases in median incomes, and lower crime rates. What we have done is create ordered, stable and safer communities for families to live in. We have introduced amenities that have never existed – amenities that other communities have enjoyed for decades...” He becomes a little more animated as he speaks, as if he really believes what he is saying. That breaks her heart. At the same time, she also can’t stop the swell of pride and relief when she realizes he has grown to become quite handsome, in his own special way. Her son wasn’t a cute baby. When she’d first held him, she’d burst out in tears, screaming he wasn’t her baby, couldn’t be her baby - because he looked wrong and funny. Not how she’d thought a newborn baby should look – fat and plump and pink. He was scrawny, his head bumpy and weird-shaped, his ears sticking out like he was trying to fly away. Leia mostly cringes at the memory. Although sometimes, it also makes her laugh. “…the first major project you were attached to – there was a corruption investigation, and a State Senate inquiry…” His interruption didn’t miss a beat, “both of which unequivocally found no wrong doing by First Order Enterprises, any of its subsidiaries or its sub-contractors...” And there are many ways he is not like her at all. Leia knows she intimidates her interviewers with her toughness and her conviction. Leia knows she’s seen as a strong debater, aggressive and no-holds barred. Masculine, was the word used. Leia also knows her reputation proceeds her. But this version of her son is calmer, elusive; his mind is constantly ticking. It’s hard to pin him down, and that makes him far more dangerous. Leia knows Annabelle Hayes. She’s been interviewed by her before - the woman is not easily intimidated. “ But you can admit that a perception persists – you forcibly and illegally evicted residents and exploited your connections to compel support for First Order Enterprises projects. ” “ No. Those claims are entirely false. We use strictly legal means to reclaim our property. As to connections; the perception – and its possibility – doesn’t exist.” He pauses. When he begins again, his look is pointed, his tone alluding. “I would never allow for a situation where we are tied up, pissed on, then debased on the floor of a cheap motel by the powers that be…” Leia can’t quite work out his strange, tangential reply. But she gets the impression he is circling in for the kill. “… no matter how it might advance our interests. Especially where the rewards are at the cost of personal dignity, professional integrity, ethical standing and, of course, possible criminality.” The camera switches from him to Annabelle’s uncomfortable, deer-in-the-headlights expression. Suddenly, everything is clear. Leia sips her at her snifter of brandy. The little shit. He’s done it again. Annabelle’s next few questions are all awkwardly delivered softballs. His expression has hardly changed. But Leia can see the slight tightening at the corner of his lips. He’s feeling smug and self-satisfied; and all of a sudden, Leia has lost her desire to watch anymore. Leia draws her shawl tighter around her shoulders and gets up to switch off the set. A welcome silence fills the room. A familiar mess of anger and sadness fill her in equal measure whenever she sees her son. Two parallel thoughts running though her mind. That little shit, her poor little boy. Why couldn’t he see he was wrong? What had he become? If only she’d been a better mother… Forget brandy. She needs a scotch. Leia holds the opening of her shawl tightly as she makes her way to the antique bar cabinet, swings open the doors and reaches in deep behind the bottles for the fifth of scotch she knows is hidden there. Her hands almost tremble as she begins to uncap the bottle. Her glass tinks against the bottle as she begins to pour. She regrets watching the show, but can’t find it in her to regret seeing her son’s face. A piercing rings cuts through the silence of the room. It’s the telephone, but whoever it is can leave a message. Leia is not in the mood tonight. She lifts the glass, examines its contents, decides to pour in just a little more. The ringing persists. The voicemail message plays, then there’s a sharp, high-pitched tone. She stops when she hears her brother’s voice. “Leia? It’s Luke. I know you’re there. Pick up the phone.” She almost smiles. He knows her too well. “Hello? Leia? Answer the phone. This is important.” She sighs as she sets down the untouched scotch, and goes to pluck the handset from the receiver. Her lingering mood, weary and melancholy, colors her voice. “Luke. Not tonight.” He’s normally sensitive to her feelings. His persistence is a departure from the norm. “Leia, I am coming over right now. I have something that you need to see.” “Luke…” she warns without strength. “I have Lor San Tekka with me.” Leia is genuinely surprised, incredulous. “…Lor San Tekka is in Coruscant?” “Yes.” Leia sighs, glances towards the scotch, her half-finished brandy. She doesn’t know if she’s strong enough to deal with the two of them tonight. She has to dig deep within. Her eyes close, she draws herself up higher. “Alright. Come over, then.” Luke hangs up without saying goodbye. ==================================================== She’d tipped both drinks down the drain, washed the glasses and put them away without letting Threepio know. She’d tried to go back to her draft report. But couldn’t focus. She gives up, decides to simply wait. Something about Luke’s uncharacteristic manner has set her on edge. When Threepio announces their arrival, they both stand at the door to her television room, looking flushed from the cold and inexplicably harried. She searches them for clues, and instantly, her eyes fall to the crumpled envelope in Lor San Tekka’s hands. She begins to cross the room. He seems to realize what she’s looking at, and slowly extends it out towards her. He lets go of it without resistance. “What am I looking at?” She asks as she takes it. She goes back towards the couch, untying the envelope and carefully easing out a photocopied sheet of paper. As she begins to reads, the envelope drops to the floor. Leia is shocked to her bones. “My god…” she issues, legs giving out. She falls back onto the couch. “I’m sorry, Leia.” It was Lor San Tekka who spoke. Luke is looking anywhere but at her. Leia meets Lor San Tekka’s eyes from where she sits. “This whole time, all these years?” “Yes.” Her hand trembles as she rereads the document. Her hand over her mouth, tears threatening to fall from her eyes. She is sure she no longer loved him - she might have even hated him for what he did – but she is sure that he didn’t deserve this. “Tell me everything you know.” Her eyes are narrowed; her face was stern. She glares at Lor San Tekka. Her demand is hard. The document now lay between them, on the coffee table, bared to the world. It reads. State of Jakku. Standard Certificate of Death. Full Name: Unknown Cause of Death: Gunshot Wound of Chest. Affidavit for Amendment of Death Record. Name of Deceased, Han Solo. Chapter 20 : Don’t You Tell Nobody, Now. Summary: I love you all. :D Thanks for taking a chance on this experiment. You all keep me inspired. Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Poppy’s last days were the hardest. Those were the days Rey spent living within five feet of his hospital bed. Buried underneath the tubes and the needles and the wires, and the cheap, thin, gown; he didn’t look like Poppy anymore. The worst was when he didn’t remember who she was or called her by her mother’s name. The last fifteen years seemingly erased and replaced by the metastatic flesh that riddled his emaciated body. But sometimes, the last fragments of his soul rallied and scraped through the dimness that clouded his eyes - and he’d see again. He’d be there, and he was Poppy once more. He woke her up with a chuff of his frail, failing voice. “Alright, baby-girl…” She looked up from where she had lain her head, but Poppy wasn’t there. He was staring at the ceiling, talking to a memory. She spoke in the place of absent ghosts. “I’m here.” He smiled then, his eyes closed, and he reached towards the heavens with a gnarled and spastic claw. His voice is a wisp, an echo. He hears laughter from the past. “On three.” Those were the last words she ever heard her Poppy say. She wasn’t by his side on the afternoon he died. When he left, he was dreaming; of the precious baby girl who’d left him, and the one he had to leave behind. ==================================================== A shocked gasp, and the make-believe privacy of the thin, teal curtain is completely shattered. Maz and the doctor both turn to look at the shadowy figure standing on the other side. With a squint through her thick round glasses, Maz chuckles, and her strong voice is booming, though her scold is still a gentle one. “Child, aren’t you meant to be at the diner today?” No answer. “Well, don’t just stand there.” Hooks screech along metal railing as the curtain opens, just enough so that Rey can slip in. She tries to shrink from Maz’s sharp gaze as she finds the least obtrusive corner in the tiny space. Before long, Maz’s attention returns to the distinguished looking doctor, reading the medical chart in her hands with the butt of her heavy metal pen. “Go on, doctor.” Maz encourages. “As I was saying, Ms Kanata,” The doctor folds the chart closed, then hangs it off the end of the hospital bed. “We will need to continue doing some more tests to determine the best course of treatment. However, it’s likely treatment duration will be protracted. Most patients find getting the diagnosis is scary. But it can be especially difficult without adequate support. Do you have a strong support network in place?” Maz turns to Rey with a mischievous smile on her crinkly lips. “Doctor, would you mind giving me a moment to speak with my granddaughter?” The doctor nods as she slips her pen into the breast pocket of her scrubs. She leaves with a sympathetic smile. Rey is left feeling stark at the foot of Maz’s bed, only daring to look up at the sound of light thumps. Maz pats the space beside her, tilts her head a little. Rey feels every ounce of weight behind Maz’s gaze as she follows the silent order. Maz waits until Rey is sat down before she speaks. “Child, how much did you hear?” “Not a lot…” Maz’s gaze hardens at the lie. Rey stares down at clenched hands in her lap. It takes her a while before her admission comes out. “Liver cancer.” Maz nods matter-of-factly. “Yes. Liver cancer. It’s outta my hands, but I’ll be working with the doctors to fix it, understand?” Rey nods. “Good.” Maz smiles, reaching out her tiny hand to Rey. She squeezes the young woman’s fingers. She tsks when she sees Rey’s tears. “You can cry now, child. But once you out these doors, you hold your head up high and you live strong. You forget this cancer, cos don’t you worry child, I am gonna fight it with tooth and nail. Maz isn’t going anywhere.” Rey wipes her eyes with the heel of her free hand, tries to smile in return. “Good girl.” Maz’s hard, work-roughed thumb is gentle when she wipes away the remaining tears. Her voice brims, almost cracks with rare warmth and affection. “You are a brave, strong girl, child. Knew it the moment I clapped my eyes on you.” She grins broadly at a sudden memory, chuckles to herself. “That’s why you’re my favorite.” Rey laughs in return, shakes her head. “But the boys…Poe and Finn and even little Grumpy,” Maz’s voice fades with thought, when she begins again, her voice gradually firming with resolve. “They haven’t seen the things you’ve seen, child. They know so little. And poor Luke, he carries the world…So you promise ol’ Maz, alright?” Rey bites her lip, slowly nods her head. “Yes, Maz?” Maz knows it is a heavy burden; given choice, she would never have bestowed it. But she trusts this small-shouldered girl, wise beyond her years. She is a kindred spirit, capable of boundless love, a sister and a daughter. Maz’s request is solemn. “You promise me, child,” she says, “don’t you tell nobody, now.” ==================================================== Don’t you tell nobody, now. Yellow caution tape whips in the cold night air. The bus shelter is smashed, but Rey doesn’t care. She sinks onto the steel bench, ignoring how it sapped away her body heat. She is turned harsh yellow by the blinking light of the garish advertisement that persists in its cracked case. Black Friday Sale! Up to 85% off! Maz told her not to cry, to be strong. Rey had made the promise, her hand over the thin skin covering her wounded heart. “Finn, can you take my shift tonight?” She had asked Finn at lunch. Regazzo’s Pizzeria, as cheap as it was seedy, two streets down from the CU campus. She hadn’t realized she’d cut into Jessika’s story. She was lost in her selfish thoughts, could only focus on Finn. She’s a shitty friend. He’d stopped mid-bite, and with one look at her, he ignored the oily cheese that slid of his slice of dollar-pizza and said, “sure thing, Peanut.” It was exactly one week since Kylo had asked her out. Rey tries hard to keep her promises, to herself and to others. But right now, in this ruined bus shelter, she is alone - and maybe, just maybe, no one will witness as she breaks her word. The hot salt of her tears stings against her skin. She had thought herself alone, or at least, unknown. From beyond the halo of yellow, Rey hears the crunch of snow and bulleted glass from the smashed bus shelter. A shadow falls over her, so close she can feel radiant heat. Wordlessly, she pushes herself up from the cold, cold bench. She yields herself to the darkness of the heavy, brushed wool coat, her fingers twisting into the smooth burgundy scarf, her cheek buried at the center of a warm, broad chest. He stiffens beneath her, then slowly, gently, she feels herself cocooned within his soft wool coat, secure in the tight circle of his big, strong arms. She sighs as she nuzzles deeper into his chest. His scent surrounds her, cloves and spicy wood, comfortable, warm and safe. Underneath the flickering yellow lights of the advertisement, they stood together, oblivious to the cold outside. Notes: Dear beloved readers (but one in particular), Please don't hate me. Love, Jaxx Chapter 21 : Comfort Summary: All Reylo lovers: rejoice! Our emotionally dense couple are back in each others' lives. Ten points to anyone who guessed bus guy was Ren. Minus twenty if you doubted, because I threw in some prreeettty big clues. Hello, scarf? Cologne? Come on! :D Alright, you can have all your points back. And THAT, kids, is why they never invited me back to referee ever again. :( Enjoy! Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Relief. Rey realizes she is sighing in relief. Kylo is holding her, overwhelming all of her senses, keeping her other worries away. He hasn’t left her thoughts once, not since their disastrous night together. Their night kept replayed vividly, cruelly, tauntingly. Him kissing her, him covering her with his entire body, him moving deep inside of her. His desperate pleading with her. Please, Rey. Don’t. When she saw herself in the mirror the morning after, she realized with startling lucidity his eyes were staring back at her. She should have known. She had seen his look on her own face before, back in the dark days of Jakku. But she had missed it that night, even though she was sitting on top of him, blinded as she was by her passion, her desire, her sympathy for him. She didn't know what had made his marks, didn't know the pain he went through to acquire them. She had meant to show him that he was beautiful. She had instead showed him his nightmares. The very next morning, her anger towards him had simply vanished, washed away by her painful realization, replaced with the harsh clarity that came with the cool, still morning. She understood why the man had pushed her away. She had hurt him. She had hurt him, maybe more than he had hurt her. Contrition came first, long before forgiveness. Please, Rey. Don’t. She clings to him tighter, nuzzles him harder; one part apology, one part need. She doesn’t want to let him go now that she is in his arms again. He stands completely still, like a statue, quietly letting her know he is even less familiar with comfort than she ever was. Her poor, broken giant. He somehow still soothes her, in spite of his jagged edges. She takes the pitiful scraps that he has to offer, allowing the warmth and the solidness of his body to anchor her. She can feel him respond to her closeness. But he seems unaware of it, or at least he is intent on ignoring it. It doesn’t offend her. It offers her its own comfort and reassurance. He still wants her. Her tears slowly stopped, dried to itchy tracks on her skin, her hiccuped breath has evened. She is lulled by the rises and falls of his strong chest. She is almost asleep on her feet. He breaks their silence by whispering to the air above her head. “You are not safe, Rey. This neighborhood is dangerous. I will take you home.” She nods against him, unwilling to move until he gently pries her from him. His warmth stripped from her, the world floods back in and she is left feeling a little fragile again. It’s nonsensical that tears prick her eyes at the sight of his broad back retreating, she is hugging her arms as she follows. He leads her a little way up the street, settles her into the back of his big, black car. When he climbs in on his side, he sits as far away from her as possible, so tight against his door that his face is almost pressed against the window. But Rey still needs him, so she slides across the warm, black leather to lean against him. He startles, stiffens. He glares down at her with a fire that was doused quickly with her look. He is pliant enough to let her pull his arm around her and bury herself into his body once more. The effect is instant. Relief. Comfort. Need. He allows Rey to pull him down, allows her to press kisses on his soft, full lips. When he straightens, she whimpers, and tugs and he bends again to kiss away the salt-sting from her cheeks. He returns to her lips when she guides him back. But he doesn’t deepen the kiss like she needs him to. Her hand goes to his thigh, to push herself up towards him when he starts to pull away again. Her fingers accidentally find him, hidden under the fabric along his inner thigh. He hisses. She immediately sits back down, and looks at where her hand rested, where she is barely grazing him. He was still hard, and she finds she wants the comfort that she knows it can offer. He is twitching beneath her gaze. But the car is coming to a stop. Her building looms large outside. She stares up at him, and knows she is not ready for him to go. She reaches forward, tenderly brushes her fingers down his erection, just enough pressure to cause him to moan. She wills him to understand her request. She needs him tonight. Comfort. He hesitates. He hesitates before he barely nods, but it is enough. She is dragging him out of his car, pulling him behind her, only dropping his hand as she wrestles with the heavy metal gate. He lags a few steps behind her on the stairs up to her apartment – she knows, because she is keeps checking to see that he follows. He stands still beside her as she fights to open her stubborn front door. Her cold, dim, tiny, slightly messy apartment suddenly feels a lot smaller with him standing in it, as he seems to take up most of the space. He makes no comment. Rey leads him by the hand to her windowless bedroom. Switches on her desk lamp; a soft yellow glow. He is left standing at her open door, unmoving. She guides him to the edge of her single bed, pushes him down to sit. She turns around to close them within a world of their own making. He looks up her with his expressive eyes, his jaw tight clenched. He is gripping the edge of her bed so hard that it creaks. Worried he was having second thoughts; she crouches between his legs, meets him with her eyes. His mouth falls open in a silent moan as she touches his heavy erection once more. His death-grip loosens, she straightens up. She unzips her boots before him, pulling off her jeans and her panties in one swift motion. He doesn’t move a muscle, although he lets out a ragged, tortured breath when her scent fills the room. She stands closer to him, her feet planted wide, one hand on his shoulder, the other on his cheek. She draws patterns on his skin. He doesn’t move, looking at her with eyes open and full. She wants comfort, relief... no words could describe it well enough. “Kylo,” she begs, when he looks for far too long, “please touch me.” He complies. His hands lift off her bed, and he removes his gloves, methodically pulling them from his large, pale hands. He sets the gloves down beside him. She feels her mouth go dry as his bared right hand turns palm side up. He is still staring deep into her eyes. His touch is like his gaze, soft and reverent as he cups and holds her sex. She gasps, clenches at his shoulder, bunching the fabric with white knuckles. His thick, long middle finger dips between her lips to press on her throbbing clit. On instinct, she begins rocking into him. The little thrums of pleasure feel nice, but it isn’t quite enough to chase her pain or her want away. Comfort. “I…I need more.” He nods, seats her clit between two fingers, and begins rubbing in tight, little circles, sending quick honeyed pulses along her. She rocks harder, loses her balance and whimpers. His other hand holds her hip to steady her. She feels him move to stand while he keeps rubbing, and he guides her by her overheated sex to sit where he had been sat. She can feel his heavy gaze, even though her own eyes are now closed. His circling doesn’t cease even as he goes on his knees before her. She bites her lips, moans, her grip harder on his shoulders as he speeds up. No more pain. Now it is only lust. “More, Kylo. More.” He is panting now, and leaves her whining when his fingers fall away. He is pushing her to lie down, then gently pulls her legs wider apart. On his hands and knees before her, he presses his nose against her, sighing as he breathed her flushed and swollen mound. She doesn’t get to see his three helpless, useless thrusts into nothing but air. But she hears him groan. She whimpers, mewls, scrapes her nails on his scalp. She feels his hot breath, the rasp of his day-old stubble. Then, finally, the warm, comforting wetness of his tongue as he licked her, repeatedly, from her entrance to her clit. She bucks, her thighs and buttocks quake and quiver, she floods and drips with new wetness. He laps up each drop, leaving hot, lingering trails on her skin. She repeats his name in a delirious litany. His lips fasten around her clit, pulls at her with gentle suckles, pokes and flicks at her with his tongue, drawing high-pitched, sighing moans from her with each repetition. Rey is screaming, lost to the sensation, nothing concerns her but her greedy clit which feels harder and achier even as he sends pleasure through it and into her groin. She whines desperately whenever he pauses to consume the generous wetness she surrendered. She is close, needs even more from him. She begs again. “In…inside. F...f…fuck…” He doesn’t stop his ministrations with his mouth, but he satisfies her request. Not in the way she had hoped, but it does help. He brings his fingers back into play. He is tracing her lower lips almost…lovingly. Yes, lovingly. Each stroke soothes and stokes her. When he finally parts her, he circles and dips at her entrance without penetrating her. She doesn’t care, because the pressure in her clit has suddenly become unbearable. She screams his name as she comes, her over-turgid clit exploding in painful pleasure. He pulls away from her jumpy, raw, orgasming nub. Her entrance is gushing wetness, and she is more sensitive than she has even been before. He chooses this moment to hold her hips down, to slip his fingers smoothly inside of her. It’s too much. Too much. Even though his strokes are long-drawn and gentle, he is rending her down to her barest elements. She would kill him if he ever dared to stop. When her blinding orgasm finally trickles to its end, and low-hum of arousal returns, her hips stop bucking erratically. She has enough control to respond to the careful thrusting of his thick fingers. She pushes herself up on her elbows. He was back on his knees again, and she realizes he was still staring at her face, with that same unreadable, roiling expression back in his eyes. It started as a blossom, then explodes into full bloom. It suddenly all makes perfect sense, but it still leaves her feeling confused, conflicted. Everything feels different. She opens her mouth to speak, but he looks away to hide his eyes and he shakes his head, slowly. They are working together now, her with her hips and him with his hands, finding spot that makes her clench him in urgency and moan. She angles her hips, thrusts back to encourage him. His thumb is back on her clit and even though she wants to close her eyes at the wonderful feelings he pushes into her, she fights it. She needs to see him as much as she needs him inside of her. The second orgasm takes her by surprise. The build was so slow, that when she came, she had simply overflowed, a stressed levee breaking. Waves of pleasure flooded her veins, her bones, her sinews and she spasms and clenches his fingers tight, traps his hand between her thighs. His screamed name represents everything. He moves with her as she undulated and arched and lost all control. At the end of it, she fell back onto the bed, still humming from her release. She is entirely spent, sleepy, sated. A silly smile on her lips. His hand stills. He pulls out of her with a slick, wet noise. She doesn’t like how she suddenly feels empty. He soothes the deep ache a little by licking her clean. When he finally withdraws from her most intimate part, he leaves her with a heartbreakingly soft kiss. She immediately misses his comforting touch. She becomes vaguely aware that he is on his feet again, she watches him through hooded eyes as he adjusts his unsatisfied hardness, then slowly moved to the side of her bed. He bends down, smooths her hair back from her forehead, and he kisses her sweetly. He helps her climb under her bed covers, lets her kiss him one last time. She doesn’t hear his whispers as she finally, blissfully, falls asleep. The night was still young. The bedroom door closes behind him with a soft click. She sleeps a restful, dreamless sleep. His gloves, forgotten, still lay at the foot of her bed. Notes: Know how I said weekend? This scene got stuck in my head and it had to be written. Ride the wave as they say. You guys don't mind, right? Chapter 22 : Family History Notes: I'm sorry I took so long to update. Been really busy. But I promise, I am not going to abandon you. :) A warm welcome to the new readers. Enjoy. (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) The man in the tux is a lobbyist and she isn’t interested. He looks like he wants to approach. But Leia shakes her head, points to the phone against her ear, and he nods, smiles and moves away. The Annual Coruscant Museum Thanksgiving Gala, held every third Sunday of November. It was ostensibly a charity event, but really, it was just another chance for the elite of the city to do business. No one cared what the cause was anymore. Leia only goes to these events as often as required, never more. Tonight, she came with her own set of objectives. She makes sure no one else is in earshot before she whispers again. “Luke, can you even handle this alone?” She hears her brother huff and heave through the speaker. There is clatter of wheels on asphalt, and the sound of car trunk slamming shut. He must be at the airport by now. “I’ll handle it, Leia. Trust me. You can’t go to Jakku, not someone as high profile as you are, not for this.” She knows. In politics, appearance and perceptions matter. It irks her, but anything to do with Han was political suicide. It was best if she maintained at least some distance. There is so much she still wants to say to Luke, but now is not the time. “Be safe, Luke.” “I will, Leia.” There is rustling as he readjusts the phone on his end, “have you told him yet?” No, she hasn’t even seen him. She’s standing at the top of the magnificent marble staircase in the Grand Gallery, looking down over the throng of tuxedos and evening gowns. She should be able to spot him from here. She frowns in grim determination. “No, but I will.” “Ok. Well, I’ll call you later when I get to Jakku.” “Alright.” The phone is back in her clutch, and her attention returns to the party below. She suddenly grips harder at the cold, bronze capped baluster. There. A familiar shape cuts through the crowd. Dark-haired and statuesque, he moves like a shark, unaffected and untouched. People move out of his way. Kylo Ren. Eventually, he is stopped, by a blonde woman in chiffon and lace. She was with an older man who quickly drops his hand from around her waist. Leia knows who they are. They’re part of the Castillo clan - her party had been courting them for years, at least until their fortunes turned south. She hates that she knows this, dislikes that part of politics – it’s legal, it’s necessary, but it’s all so sleazy. The woman keeps touching Kylo’s arm, stands closer to him than her own husband. Leia doesn’t want to know. She grips the baluster harder. Kylo seems unamused by the attention. He bears it, but his focus keeps flitting away from the couple standing in front of him. Every so often, he nods at someone across the room, raises his glass of champagne towards them. The couple is unfazed. Kylo suddenly looks up at sees her. His gaze meets her for the briefest of moments, before his attention turns away again. It’s enough. He doesn’t watch as Leia climbs down the curve of the staircase, and crosses the expanse of the intricate mosaic floor. She holds a stern look on her face, enough to deter anyone who might want to get in her way. She almost reaches him when, as if on some soundless cue, he firmly shakes the man’s hand, leans down to let the woman leave a lingering kiss his cheek, and bids them both a goodnight. The couple drift away. Kylo stays where he stood and he waits until Leia is before him. She has to crane her neck to look at his face. No hug, no kiss for his mother. He is impassive as always, eyes distant as he keeps scanning across the Grand Gallery. Leia knows he’s mentally checking off a list of meet and greets, and deliberately ignoring her. Leia has no time for his petty mind games and power plays. He may be one of the most quietly influential men in the capital, but in this moment all she sees is an impertinent teenager, hell-bent on annoying his mother. But pragmatism makes her give in, speaks first, even using the name she absolutely hates , because it wasn’t the one she gave him. “Hello, Kylo.” She senses his triumph, even as he replies with a crisp, flat, uninterested tone. “Mother.” The word rings hollow. “A pleasure to see you again.” She’s been calling his office since Thursday, when Luke and San Tekka dropped by. All she got were empty promises from his assistant. Mr Ren will be in touch. Leia does her best not to give in to the temptation to scold, that would shut him down even faster. He already gives her so little to go on. She tries to soften her normally brash voice, but she doesn't quite manage it. “I have been trying to reach you for three days.” His eyes narrow, he crackles with energy, but it is brittle underneath. “I have been…otherwise occupied.” She knows this mood well. He is angry. Anger was his shield whenever he was afraid and in pain. The worse he felt, the more he pounded on his wounds, working himself up into a terrifying rage. They started not long after she found him again. She remembers feeling powerless when she first witnessed her boy's savage self-destruction. It was a side of him she had never seen before. She had been relieved to relinquish control, to cede her son to another, and it was the worst mistake of her life. She shouldn’t have given up on him, and she shouldn’t have given him up. She isn't powerless anymore. “Honey,” she asks gently this time, like she once did when he was no more than a baby, “is everything alright?” For a second, there is a crack in his façade. A look flashes in his eyes, a shimmer in the darkness; Leia catches it just in time. She reaches out to touch his face, and miraculously, he doesn’t immediately recoil. He looks down at her with the eyes of a different man, and there he is, her son. Her little boy is back. But she doesn't have time to feel. He disappears as quickly as he came. He pulls her hand away from him, draws himself up to his full height. Leia speaks quickly, loudly. She doesn't care anymore who hears. “Han has passed away.” Kylo pauses. “Your father, he died in Jakku.” He looks to the floor and is silent. “Uncle Luke has gone to bring him back.” When he looks at her again, his blank expression was back on his face. Without a word, he turns his back on her and walks away, blending into the crowd. She doesn’t call out to him, because her son was already gone. From behind her, she hears an unmistakable sound. A squeal of metal that sends ice to her core. Tingles and tendrils of dread dance around her head and neck. It's too late. A spittle-filled drawl, lazy words drip, and she’s surrounded by a wall of black from which she fears she will never escape. “My love,” his endearment crawls horribly on her skin, “I wasn’t expecting to see you .” ==================================================== Leia hasn’t seen Han Solo in over twenty years. But her memories of him have not faded. She remembers him exactly, leaning against a fridge in someone’s house, in his tight, unbuttoned Henley shirt and his dark denim jeans. He was handsome, cocky, and walked around with a swagger and bravado that was irritating. She hated him on sight, and couldn’t understand why bookish Luke had brought him to the party. Han was a jackass, and their first meeting ended up with her kicking his shin. Not the most auspicious start to a relationship. But boy, were they a passionate couple. That, they always had, even when their relationship soured because he got stir-crazy and reckless. Passion was a poor reason to start a family, but then again, her son wasn’t exactly planned. Her daddy, the Senator, was disappointed, and very adamant. “Leave him, princess. You are not suited to each other.” Leia still married Han though, five months pregnant and showing, in a private little ceremony with no dress, no cake, no flowers. Just two signatures witnessed by Luke and a city clerk. Then, they got into Han’s rusty bucket of a car (his baby, the Millennium Falcon) and started their married life together in Takodana. Two stubborn, independent, passionate people who were not good at compromising. It was doomed to fail from the start. They never agreed on anything. Tiffs and spats became full-on fights, and there was often pounding on their door at all hours of the night. It was always about money, some old debt Han still owed, although he never really talked to her about it. He never even talked about what he was doing, when he took his Millennium Falcon and disappeared for days on end. When asked, he just grinned his lop-sided grin and said almost cryptically, “I’m working on something big.” She knew so little about Han, and what he did. It became all too much. Even for a Leia, who had been so determined not to fail, to convince herself that she had chosen right. Four years of marriage, and passion wasn’t enough. The phone calls from nameless men became aggressive, the bills went unpaid, and big red letters started showing up. She started calling her daddy in secret, desperately unhappy and afraid. “Princess, please come home.” A new voice, persuasive and calm, joined her father ’s. “ You can start again …” “You don’t belong there. You were meant for a much greater purpose …” “You have so much potential, my dear. So many things you can accomplish . I can help you accomplish them…” “My darling …” “My love …” Slowly, her dreams reawakened, got bigger again. Her world expanded beyond the four walls of her roach infested Takodana apartment. She was meant for greater things, to make use of her impeccable education. Being a mother, being Han’s wife was not her destiny. She was going to return to Organa House, to reconcile with her father, to restart her life. To lead the life she was meant to lead. Han struck first. He took their son, his Millennium Falcon, everything he could fit into it and simply vanished. Four years. It took four years to find her son again, and the first time she saw him, it was in a private hospital room in Jakku. She wept when she first saw his little face under the bandages, stitches, bruises and scrapes. She had been so very close to losing him forever. Her son almost hadn’t made it, he only pulled through with literally minutes to spare. He had already grown up so much that she couldn’t recognize him. She had held onto Archibald, mourning lost time, and he was her pillar of strength. No one knew where Han Solo was. After what happened to her son, she didn’t care. Han had let their son almost die. For that, she could never forgive him. With Archibald’s help, the courts were quick to grant her full custody. “He’ll come live with us, my love,” Archibald said, “I shall treat him as if he were my own.” When she whole-heartedly agreed, Leia didn’t realize that meant she would lose her son all over again. Archibald Snoke seemed like such a perfect man, a perfect husband. A perfect teacher. She didn’t see him for what he truly was, until it was far too late. Notes: Oh, and don't worry, we'll be getting back to Reylo. I did tag this story "slow burn." :( See you again soon! :D Chapter 23 : Goodbye, Takodana Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Kylo strides through the crowd - his cell phone held out prominently in front of him as a deterrent - but he still attracts unwanted attention. He feels as if he is bursting apart at the seams, and it is a position under which he knows he does not flourish. He contains himself enough that he manages to at least shake hands and share a few words of severely cut conversation. He knows he has raised eyebrows, possibly ruffled a few delicate, self-important feathers. Fuck. Them. All. He throws open the door to the men’s room, and growls threateningly at the lone man he finds standing at the urinals. He glares, watches as the man quickly zippers up and skitters outside like a dog. With a balled fist, he stalks down the line of stalls and strikes each door wide open, peering in to confirm he is alone. Once satisfied, he storms back to the entrance and flips the lock. He ignores the hammering and shouting on the other side of the door. A few deft swipes of the screen, and he holds his phone to his ear. His call is answered after two rings. “Hell-ooo-ooo?” Kylo doesn’t recognize that giggling male voice. Men should not giggle. That annoys him. But the fact that she has allowed for her business cell to be answered by a non-employee enrages him. “Put. Her. On .” He hears the rustling of sheets, wrestling over the phone, obscenities being whispered. Finally, her voice comes through in an irritated hush. “Yes, sir?” He snarls. “You are not alone.” A muted whump , then a few seconds later, her voice sounds through once more, echoless and enclosed. “I’m sorry, sir.” He ignores the insincerity oozing in her voice. She will become incredibly sincere when he is through with her. “You were meant to be capable, Ms Netal. I am disappointed.” “Sir?” “Jak- ku .” He spits the last syllable maliciously. “Fucking Han Solo .” Dead silence. “What was it you told me when I asked you back then? When we got back?” He growls, then pauses and waits for her answer. With none forthcoming, he answers for her. “You don’t remember, Ms Netal? You said to me nobody knows.” “…yes, sir.” He grips his phone until it creaks in protest, his low hiss sizzles and snaps with fury. How dare she be timid? How dare she lie , when she knew how important it was? “Then why was I just blind-sided by Leia Organa, telling me Han Solo is fucking dead? Even Skywalker knows! He’s in Jakku retrieving the fucking body ! ” It seems Ms. Netal is short on pithy, snide remarks. Good. He did not want explanations. “I want you to get on a plane right now, Ms Netal. I want you in Jakku. I want you to find out what the fuck is going on, and I do not want you to fail me again, because if you do, I will put YOU in the fucking ground! Do I make myself clear?” She answers immediately. “Yes, sir.” He hangs up, angrily shoves his phone back into the breast pocket of his tuxedo. Han Fucking Solo. Your father, he died in Jakku… That man, ‘ dad ’, was not a father… Kylo’s hands are shaking. His hands are still shaking as he turns on the tap, and splashes the rushing cold water to his face. When he glances up into the mirror, he stares back into his eyes. Han Solo’s eyes. Dad. “Ok, Kiddo. Which one’s the dipstick?” “Kiddo! Hands away from your body! You wanna surprise ‘em when ya jab!” “What’d I say, Kiddo?” “Run. Hide.” “That’s right. And don’t come out until I come get you, ok?” “Ok.” “That’s my boy. Do me proud.” He clears his mind by shaking his head, squeezing his eyes shut. Dead nerves feel phantom pain. The hammering on the door has become louder, and more than one voice has joined in on the shouting. He is in control. He straightens up, turns off the tap, rips paper-towel from the dispenser and dabs until his face dry. His shirt cuffs are wet. One quick check in the mirror, and he looks composed once more. He goes to unlock the door, pulls it open and comes across a posse of surprised looking catering staff, security guards and the man he had frightened away. A slack-jawed janitor stands immediately in front of him, holding out bunch of keys. He meets them all with a steady gaze. He is Kylo Ren, and he does not need to explain himself. He says nothing as he shoulders his way through them, and heads back towards the impromptu Gala dining room, set in the Tarsus Valorum Hall. The night is not yet over. He must persist, even though mutiny and betrayal is all that suffuses his mind. ==================================================== This wasn’t it, but it still felt like the last hurrah. “So, that’s it then?” “That’s it.” Finn looks up, offers a big, warm smile to Mrs Pava who had just set out several cans of soda in front of them. “Thanks, Mrs Pava, you didn’t have to.” Mrs Pava smiles back, albeit sadly. She hums in her singsong voice, and fondly scrubs Finn’s fuzzy hair. Finn normally hates it, but this time, he doesn’t say one word of complaint. Mrs Pava heads back towards the restaurant kitchen. He is about to call out to her, but Jessika stops him. “Don’t, Finn. Mom feels better when she’s working.” The Pavas have gone all out, tonight. There was so much food laid out before them, that they’d had to abandon their usual spot in the Takodana Chinese Restaurant and were sitting at the Big Table. Sadly, no one had any appetite. Rey is still picking at her plate. “Are you sure there’s nothing you can do?” Poe asks, for the fifth or sixth time. “They’re evicting everybody, and they won’t negotiate, because they’re tearing the entire building down.” “You could find some other place close to here, right?” Finn asks. Jessika shakes her head. “Dad says no. This areas getting more expensive, and when we have to close up here, money will be really tight. Plus, he insists on me finishing college, as long as they can afford it.” Her tears well up again, and she is embarrassed. Poe is quick to hug her against his chest. “Hey, hey, Jess.” He coos. “It’s gonna be alright. Whatever you guys need help with, just ask, ok?” Jessika sniffles as she is released. She wipes her nose, and the wet spot she’d made on Poe’s sweater. “Geez, I’m so sorry, Poe.” “Yeah,” Poe says. “Me too.” ==================================================== Poe is upset tonight. The born and bred Takodana boy, first it was Frankie’s and now the Takodana Chinese Restaurant was going to go away. All the places he’d loved since he was a kid. All the places he’d taken Finn and Rey to when they’d first moved in from across the river, with a “ follow me ”, and “ I swear, you’re gonna love this place .” He barely cheers up when Finn snuggles in under his chin. “Hey, Poe.” “Hey, baby.” Finn kisses Poe’s throat, but Poe doesn’t even seem to want to smile. Finn looks to Rey for help, but she can only shrug. She’s been lost in her own quiet funk for days, and has barely said a word. Finn makes the decision. “Do you still want me to go to with you to your parent’s place for Thanksgiving?” Poe leans back to look down at Finn. Hopeful, and with a hint of a grin on his lips. “You really want to?” Finn nods. “Yeah.” Poe cracks a grin, then frowns again, as he looks towards Rey. “But then Rey will be here all alone on Thanksgiving.” Rey quickly shakes her head. “No, it’s fine. I can spend thanksgiving with Maz, she needs the company.” Poe still seems to unsure, feels a little selfish. He gets over it quickly when Rey teases him. “Besides, I think it’s time you brought home their future daughter-in-law.” Two separate cushion attacks land on her at the same time. Three grown adults should not have been pillow-fighting, at least, not for as long as they did. War can be brutal. Notes: And you thought s$&% was going down in the previous chapters? You have no clue how deep this rabbit hole goes! (Clue: Pretty f***ing deep.) Chapter 24 : Hello, Jakku Notes: Hello everyone! I'm back. :) (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) Twenty-six years ago. He will never forget it. It was early in the evening when the phone rang that night. Luke had dozed off, buried among his research materials and the exams he had been assigned by Professor Yoda to grade. His thesis and his duties as a TA occupied all of his time of late. He wiped his mouth, frowned at the puddle of drool he had left on his desk and picked up the phone. “Hello, this is Luke Skywalker speak…” “Luke! Please, do you know where Han is?” “Leia?” His is confused in his drowsiness, glances at his watch. “Han? Isn’t he home by now?” Leia’s panic was unnerving. Leia was never panicked, frightened or scared. “Luke! Han took Benny! Han took Benny and I don’t know where he’s gone!” The bottom of Luke’s heart fell out. He knew his sister and his friend were having problems lately. He didn’t know exactly what had happened – Leia kept tight-lipped, and Han was being his usual blasé self, but… “Wait…wait,” something clicked into place. Luke stood up at his desk, tipping over his chair, he raked and tugged at his own hair. It was his turn to panic. “Han took Benny? Are you sure?” “Yes! Please, if you know where he went, please…” Luke had never felt as completely lost as he did at that moment, “Leia, I don’t know. I really don’t know…” ==================================================== Luke had stumbled off of the nine-hour flight with a vague twinge in his lower back, a furry sensation on his tongue, and a dull one-sided headache. He feels every single bit like a fifty-something year old man. Lor seemed to have fared the trip in a much better shape. The earliness of the hour meant that the airport was essentially deserted. People loitered here and there, few and far in between. An eeriness pervaded the silent building as they rolled their suitcases past the many shuttered storefronts, Lor leading the way towards the exit. “Follow me,” Lor had said, “the car is in long-term parking.” Echoing the brightly lit terminal, Luke hears a snatch of canned ‘inspirational’ music, and a recorded voice repeating: Welcome to Jakku, Where Adventure Finally Begins. As soon as the automatic doors part open to the nearly-outside world, there is an inward rush of dry, temperate desert air that fills the pores of Luke’s achy bones. Still cool in the dark-ink-blue of pre-dawn - he knows it well - the faintest breath of sunburnt ochre on the breeze. He stands still for a moment to savor it, and it warms every bit within him, strumming a nostalgic note, a feeling of belonging, reminding him of home . The desolate gray of Takodana, Coruscant could be so very claustrophobic; when Luke had once stood, his father’s ranch house at his back, in the boundless desert plains of Tatooine, under an open sky, coral and purple in its sunset majesty, dreaming of what could be . But he is not back home in Tatooine, the state he had so willingly left behind. He is in Jakku. A place of failure and regret. Perhaps he doesn’t miss the desert as much as he misses his lost youth, and the feeling of being on the precipice of all possibilities. He has lived over half a lifetime and he is set on this one wearying path. But at this very moment, his other problems seen less significant. For all he had thought that Han Solo had simply taken off again, his friend had instead lain – cold, lonely and forgotten, unloved and estranged, for almost six years. And it finally hits him, at last, even though he has known it for days. A man, deeply flawed man but repentant man, that Luke had called his friend, was really, truly, gone. The autopay machine ratchets and clicks, and Lor retrieves his parking ticket, “this way, Luke.” Luke follows, lost in thought. ==================================================== The sun has begun its ascent, breaks the line of the horizon, spilling warmth and light the sleepy little city nestled in the Kelvin Ravine. The streets are gradually filling with cars on their morning commute. They overtake a street sweeper, blinkering orange lights as it kicked up refuse gathered near the sidewalk. The silence in the car is punctuated by the dull droning of the drive time news broadcast. Luke checked his watch, still set on Coruscant time. He is three hours behind. Leia is in the capitol by now, well into her morning routine. Probably in a meeting. He quickly typed out a text message. Arrived at Jakku. All is well. Will speak later when I have more info. Luke. He doesn’t expect a reply. He doesn’t get one. He watches as they drive past a man and a woman, laughing with each other, out on their morning jog. His phone is still in his hand. Perhaps spurred by a remnant from his previous train of thought, he does something that his sense of decorum (and a little bit of shyness) doesn’t permit – she was his assistant, after all. Feeling loneliness and urgency of time passing seems to have given him a shot of courage. Another message is typed, a veiled confession, this time to Mara. I’m in Jakku now. I miss you, Mara. Luke. It takes mere seconds, and leaves him grinning like an idiot. Lor glances at him suspiciously, but otherwise does not ask. Her reply speaks volumes. I miss you too. Call me soon. Stay safe. Mara. Notes: I have about three chapters I'm working on. Expect more updates, soon-ish. Chapter 25 : Home Notes: Hello all, new and old! I just wanted to let you know, without your kudos and comments, I could never have kept this going. Thank you, thank you! We've got a lot of balls up in the air at this point, and I'm still working on structuring, so forgive me for my irregular updates. The delays aren't because I'm leaving or abandoning you - I want to make sure that each chapter is presentable before I give it to you to read. You deserve the best that I can do. : ) Please enjoy this latest chapter. Much love, Jaxx. “Rey, is one of them new-agey names.” The woman, a stranger who insisted on being called ‘mom’, can barely see over steering wheel, suddenly said, “and your momma died young? Your momma must have been a drug addict. Hippy-types are known drug addicts. Probably died shooting up her eyeballs with crack-cocaine.” Rey hugs her small bag of belongings tightly; her eyes widen with horror. “Oh, no... my mom didn’t use drugs…” The tiny woman flashes her with a withering stare. “Oh, yes, I believe you.” She sarcastically exaggerates, before snapping, “no, you listen to me, young lady. I won’t have your lying to me. I know your type. I know your momma’s type. I’ve seen hundreds of kids just like you. Well, you’re living with me now, and I insist on good, honest, god-fearing living under my roof. I won’t have you lying to me, I won’t have you poisoning my kids with your filth, I won’t. Ya hear?” Rey immediately shuts her mouth. ‘Mom’ nods, her eyes back on the road. “Good. Now, where was I? Oh, yes. Let’s set the rules. There is to be no fornicating. I won’t have some hussy spreading her legs and getting' pregnant on my watch…” In the back seat, she hears snickers. Rey is thoroughly shocked and embarrassed, by the words 'mom' uses. The list of rules continues and soon Rey really wants the earth to swallow her whole. When that doesn’t happen, she realizes she is trapped. There is no escape. It would only get worse from there. ==================================================== Maz only glances up for a second before she returns her attention to the nurse who had just secured a blood pressure cuff on her arm. “What’s with the long look, child?” The blood pressure monitor whirrs as it pumps air. Rey is standing at the foot of the bed. She offers a thin smile as she insists, “I’m alright.” Maz’s eyes twinkle, just a bit, as she stares down Rey. “You can’t fool ol’ Maz, you know?” Rey simply nods as she pretends to be interested in what the nurse was doing. The nurse is grinning. “This your ‘granddaughter,’ Maz?” Maz chuckles at the nurse. “Oh, we both know that lie’s more see-through than a window. But,” she concedes, “this child is one of the good ones.” “One of the good ones, hmm?” The nurse winks and looks knowingly at Rey, “just so you know, missy, we ain’t dummies here.” Rey blushes a little at their lie being caught out. The nurse continues unabashedly, one eye squinted, “anyways, young girl like you, nine times outta ten - it’s problems with your man.” Rey’s expression sets the nurse laughing, a friendly, jowl-shaking laugh. Even Maz seems amused. The nurse continues to speak as she works, jotting down the numbers from the monitor onto Maz’s chart, her laughter jiggles her shoulders up and down. “I knew it. Well, don’t you worry, honey. Just don’t talk to him a few days, and I swear he’ll come ca-rawling back, just begging for forgiveness.” Rey doubts that would ever happen, but she gives a tight lipped “thank you." The nurse nods as she takes of the blood pressure cuff with a loud rip of the touch fastener. Maz wriggles her freed arm while the nurse puts everything back in its place on the rolling stand. Once satisfied everything was in order, she stands next to Maz again, hand on her jutted hip, looking very pleased. “Everything looks good, Maz. Doctor says she’s coming ‘round later, and that you’re getting discharged tomorrow?” Maz snorts, “yes, well, tell her to hurry up. I am not getting any younger.” The nurse laughs. “Alright, Maz. Alright.” She grasps the handle on the stand and begins to wheel it out. Rey is already moving quietly to pull the curtain aside for her. The nurse smiles, the looks back quickly at Maz. “I’ll be back in the morning to take out the cannula.” Maz waves her hand dismissively. With then curtain closed again, Maz watches as Rey goes to sit down on the chair beside her. She waits until Rey sets down her heavy tote bag, brimming full with borrowed textbooks, down onto the floor. Her actions belie her chiding words as she reaches to quickly pat Rey’s hand, an affectionate gesture that briefly startles Rey. “Surely you’ve something better to do than hang around this dismal place?” Rey simply shrugs her shoulders and ignores the question. “Do you know what time are you going to be discharged?” Maz sighs, pushes her thick glasses back up her nose, and examines Rey closely. Her lips are pursed. “Something really is bothering you, isn’t it, child?” Rey shakes her head. “Is it the cancer?” Rey shakes her head, again. “It is the cancer.” Maz’s eyes narrow and she peers as if reading Rey’s mind. “But it’s something else too, isn't there." By now, Rey is worried that Maz really can read her mind. She sits completely still. “Well,” Maz keeps peering, hums, her tone almost resigned, “I’m just an ignorant old woman - and your boss. You don’t have to say anything to me.” Rey starts to protest, but is cut off by Maz’s amused…musing. “You know, child, if you live long enough, you see the same eyes in different people. And I’ve seen your eyes before.” Maz nods, slowly. Smiles, slowly. Chuckles. “Oh, yes. I recognized you the first day you walked into my diner, looking for a job. Yours was a lost and lonely soul, child. World-weary and old before its time. You came to Coruscant looking to start over, right?” Rey’s answer escapes her before she realizes it “…yes.” “Well, then. It’s been two years. What’s holding you back, child?” Rey frowns now, bites her lip. She averts her gaze, staring at a black smudge on the otherwise shiny, speckled floor. The answer is simple, she’s always known it, but she’s had to keep herself guarded for so long, that it’s still hard for her to materialize it into words. Her last three years in Jakku, before her emancipation, had left her cold to her core, left her wary and watchful, careful to keep everything at an arm’s length. Maz, it seems, sees and knows more than she lets on. “Child, your heart is bigger, stronger than you think it is. I know, because I see it. You have so many people here who love you, and who you love back. Whatever it is you think you are looking for, you won’t find it looking behind you – it is right in front of you. Look ahead.” Maz’s smile hasn’t faltered. She falls back against the pillows, and closes her eyes. Then, her wrinkled smile widens to a grin. Rey is speechless. “Then again, child,” Maz says, and one eye opens again, slides to look at Rey, “you don’t have to listen to me. I’m just an ignorant old woman. And your boss.” ==================================================== Rey climbs onto the bus, and taps her metro card against the fare reader. She smiles at the grumpy bus driver who doesn’t smile back. Rey doesn’t really mind. She has to shift her balance as the bus lurches forward with a brassy hiss-heave. She maneuvers her way down the rows of seats, before settling somewhere near the middle of the bus. She’s the only passenger. Fresh snow was laid since Rey had gone into the hospital. Even the streetlights glow seems warm and inviting. The world looks new. She thinks of Finn and Poe, of Jessika, Maz and Luke. She is truly grateful for her cobbled together family of friends. It had taken her time, but yes, without realizing it, she really has begun again. She really is free. She feels it. She is going home. A real home. Her home. It’s tough, it’s imperfect, but it truly does mean something to her now. She feels as if her heart really were growing bigger, and it eclipses the gnawing feeling, enough that she thinks one-day, she will finally overcome it. She loves, is loved. And it is the most important thing in the world. Just then, a thought reappears, unexpected but not unwelcome, of dark, shimmering eyes, abound with deep feeling, gazing up at her. Confusing and thrilling her at the same time. Kylo. She doesn’t know it, but her features soften as she dwells on him, all the way home. ==================================================== Halfway across the city, on top of Naberrie tower, Kylo is once again alone in the dark. He is at once all of man’s basest needs and yet, he is too exhausted to even care about remedying his discomfort. He is tired, but he cannot sleep. He is hungry, but cannot stomach food. He is thirsty, but even the thought of drinking tires him. So he sits, still wearing clothes from the Gala last night. Drained. Terrified. Slumped on the rubber mats, his back against the wall. His elbows on his knees, split-bruised knuckles pushed hard into his temples. His dried sweat irritates his skin. He has surrounded himself in the remains of his calculated destruction. His punching bag, spotted with his blood, is still mounted on its stand. It lays on its side. Toppled. Pushed over in one last furious throw that had sent the entire complex of steel and leather crashing, bouncing – hard - onto the floor, as he had stumbled backwards, and fell, defeated. He hasn’t had the strength to move. He is so very, very tired. But he cannot sleep. He cannot sleep. He cannot sleep. He cannot sleep. Chapter 26 : Sleep Notes: 404 kudos. Thank you. :) There a joining scene I added to the last chapter, to give this one some lead-in. Rey had been hugging Finn long enough for Poe to start getting a little bit jealous. He grumbled, with a huff, as soon as they finally pulled away from each other, “we’re only going away for a few days.” “A few days?!” Rey exclaimed, as if this were news. “I’ll miss you so much!” Finn cried. Then they hugged all over again, just to mess with Poe. “Come on, guys! Break it up! We’ve gotta go if we want to make it to Yavin on time.” He complained. After Rey had walked Finn to the hire car, she held open the door as get ready to slide in. There was one last quick, slightly unwieldy side-hug, a promise to call, before the door could be closed. Rey stood at the curb and waved them off, waiting until they’d turned the corner before she re-checked that the great, green door was locked. Happy that it was, she reseated the heavy tote bag on her shoulder and started the short walk home, still smiling. ==================================================== She’s nearly home when she sees a familiar looking figure parked outside her building. She slows, slows, slows until she simply stops dead in her tracks, because she doesn’t quite believe her eyes. Her voice pierces in the quiet street. “ Kylo? ” He doesn’t immediately react. That was the first indication. When he finally looks up towards her, there is no doubt. It was him, hunched and arms folded against a conspicuous black sports car, dressed in nothing but a long-sleeve t-shirt and thin slacks. He is shivering, teeth chattering in the cold. He isn’t wearing nearly enough clothes. Oh, god. He is going to freeze to death. She breaks into a run, fighting with each bounding step to keep her heavy tote bag on her shoulder. As soon as she is in front of him, she knows for sure that something is very, very wrong. He is ashen-faced and hollow-eyed, his gaze unfocused and wavering, his lips are slightly blue. He looks completely exhausted. All mirth flies from her as she worries, her heart pounding against her chest. She pleads. “Kylo, you have to come inside.” Thankfully, there is no resistance and she takes his hand to drag him to the front gate. He is as cold as ice, but she holds him tighter. She doesn’t feel him wince beneath her fingers. She curses as she fights the heavy metal gate open one-handed, before she pushes him inside and up the stairs in front of her. With every few steps, she’s offering gentle encouragement. He seems ready to collapse when they reach the landing. Once the stubborn door gives, she pulls him in, before closing the door behind her. When she turns to face him again, he is standing much closer than before. His head hung, looking at the floor. “Kyl-” “I can’t sleep.” His admission is hoarse, cracked, small; made even smaller in the blue-tinged darkness of her apartment. The sheer desperation in his voice is upsetting to her. She reaches to hold his face, feels the hard scrape of his beard, his hands cover hers. It is then she sees his knuckles, bruised and scabbed. She doesn’t know what to think, except that this man in front of her needed her help. She pulls him down, and he whimpers as she kisses him softly. She gingerly takes his injured hand. She leads him to her bedroom. Once there, she switches her desk lamp on again, and she is struck by how familiar the scene was to her. Except tonight, she would give to him. He is standing still behind her. She turns to him, and with another kiss, she gently reaches for his belt buckle. He immediately tenses all over, his eyes meeting hers in a sorrowful, strained gaze. “Rey…” She shakes her head. She already knows. She kisses him to apologize for letting him think that was her intent. “It’s ok, Kylo.” She soothes, “that’s not what we’re doing.” He relaxes, even more so once she pulls his belt free from its loops, but doesn’t attempt more. He is willing and pliable to her as she directs him to sit. She kneels on one knee as she slips off his shoes, placing them neatly under the bed. She holds open the covers as he lies down. He is entirely too big, too board for her bed. His half-lidded eyes stay on her. Even now, in this vulnerable state, the way he looks at her into her, she can barely stand it. Both the feeling in his gaze, and the feeling in her chest makes her ache. She keeps looking at him as removes her outer layers, kicks off her shoes. He shuffles backwards towards the wall as she makes to climb into the bed with him. For a second, all they do is keep looking at each other. Then, wordlessly, she draws him onto her so that her small body can shelter him as much as she can. His heavy head almost covers her entire chest, but she doesn’t care. She cradles him, gentle scratches along his scalp as he tries to completely tangle their legs. When she strokes at the bare skin of his nape, he whimpers again and holds her tighter, begging for more while already within her embrace. She hums into the crown of his head, kisses his hair. She lets him nuzzle in under her chin. She doesn’t stop touching his skin. His breathing is already evening out. Very soon, he falls asleep. She follows not long after. Chapter 27 : I Am Broken He doesn’t like to talk, so he just doesn’t. But he can still hear everything she says. Sometimes she forgets that, and it hurts him when she does it. Mom. He doesn’t really remember her, but he somehow knows she really is his mom. Even the doctor thinks he can’t hear what they’re saying. But he can hear everything, even though it looks like he’s just looking at the wet brown circle left on the doctor’s desk from his giant cup. It’s like they think he’s stupid. He isn’t stupid. He just doesn’t want to talk, because talking makes him think about it all over again, and then he gets scared and angry and he wants to chuck, it hurts, and he has to fight it and then she gets angry and then… He doesn’t mean to make her angry, and he doesn’t want to break things and throw things. He just needs to get rid of the hurt. His mom doesn’t get him. No one does. “…he is still waking up in the middle of the night, screaming. I’m at my wits end…I don’t know what to do.” “I understand your frustrations, Ms Organa. Unfortunately, nightmares are a very common symptom in cases of severe trauma. Especially when the victim is so young...” Victim. Weak. She is sitting in the backseat of the big car with him, but she isn’t looking at him. She looks like she’s about to cry again and it makes him feel bad. He can’t do anything right, even if he’s not trying to do anything at all. Mr Snoke is right about him. He had another nightmare. He can’t remember it, but he wakes up and mom is sitting next to him. She stayed with him. She tells him about how she used to sit next to him until fell asleep when he was a baby. She always tells him things he doesn’t remember. He says nothing back. He’s sorry he is sad and angry and everything. But he can’t help it. She won’t leave, even though she is yawning and he feels bad he’s too scared to fall asleep. So he pretends. He closes his eyes and keeps them closed until she goes away. He can still hear her. He hears her talking to Mr Snoke outside of his new bedroom. “…I can’t stand this anymore, Archibald. Oh, I hate him, I hate him so much!” “Do not concern yourself, my love. I will see to it...” His mom hates him. He cries. Mr Snoke was right. Mr Snoke was always right. He has to kneel in front of Mr Snoke. Mr Snoke hasn't told him to put his hand down. His knuckles still hurt from the strap. “… weak , pathetic, useless, worthless. Ben. Just like your dad . Even your mother doesn’t want you . But I can make you strong . Do you want to be strong ?” “…yes, sir.” “Good. Then repeat after me …” ==================================================== Rey bolts up to an inhuman yowling, a sharp pain against her ribs. Her heart is pounding a hundred thousand miles an hour. In an instant, she feels a sudden coldness on her sternum. She looks down, and there is a wet spot on her shirt. She touches the stain, looks at him. He is suffering. He’s sitting up, sweating and shaking and panting, dazed in the heavy, stark shadows of her bedroom. Clawing at his own hair. He doesn’t seem quite aware of what’s going on around him. The sight is difficult for her to bear, and all she wants is to make it better. She is gentle when she pries his hands from his head. At the moment their hands connect, he looks at her, and it’s like he’s just come to his senses. She’s stroking her thumbs along the back of his hands. His skin is clammy. “Kylo?” “I had another…” He stops himself, looking ashamed at whatever he was going to say. He swallows, and when he speaks, it’s an embarrassed apology. “I’m sorry I frightened you.” “It’s alright.” He didn’t seem to hear her. “…I didn’t mean to…I'm so sorry. I shouldn’t have come here, I will leave now…” Rey panics for second. The thought that he was going to leave her again…She surprises herself by the depth and strength of her feeling. She squeezes his hands tighter, trying to bring him back from whatever babbling train of thought he was embarked on, “stay.” He doesn’t seem to hear her. “…I won’t bother you again, I…” She tries again, letting go of one of his hands to touch his chin, “Kylo, please, stay.” He’s stopped babbling, but she didn’t expect what followed. For a stunned moment, he almost smiles, then his face falls, turns red, and he is tearing up, distressed. He pulls away from her, completely, “I’m…Rey... I can't... ” She doesn’t have time to react to the sinking feeling in her belly. “…You make me so weak, Rey. And I cannot be weak,” he voice fades, “I can’t…I will die again.” She draws the comforter over her as the sinking feeling is replaced by a growing coil of unease at his words. “What do you mean you will die, Kylo?” He winces at the question. He is so tense, his muscles shake. “Kylo, please talk to me.” His hands tremble as he reaches for the hem of his shirt, his fingers curl, grip, he dares her to look away, and then he tugging at the hem of his shirt, pulling it upward. The action isn't lost on her. He is tearing himself apart in front of her. “No, Kylo, you don't have to explain anymore.” He doesn’t listen, keeps going. The fabric folds over itself on its way up. With each upward inch, he reveals his torn torso to her. In the light of her desk lamp, his shadows are exaggerated and his injuries look much worse than she remembers. The shirt is pulled off, over his head, balled up in his fist. His arms make awkward, jerking movements, at once trying to cover himself and let her scrutinize, see. A horrible, discordant mess of carved jagged lines, fractal patterns like the Goazon Canyons, cut by ancient rivers, deep into bedrock. Whoever did this to him had tried to eviscerate him. She is shocked, horrified, a touch of fear remains but for him, not of him. He flinches, his teeth are gritted, his muscles twitching under the strain he puts himself under. “Do you see, Rey? Do you see? Do you still want me now?” He demands, bitterly. She does see. She sees right through him and his blustering anger, daring her, testing her. Tidally locked desiderations, pushing and pulling at the same time. Only she has the power to tip it, to change the course. She may have doubted and disbelieved, but she knows has grown between them, it was clarified when they were last together in this room. To her, it was not a choice, the road had already been set. She takes a deep breath. She is gentle, careful when she reaches for him, feels the intensity of his gaze as her hand slowly, cautiously, finally ghosts over to cover his heart. Her fingers curl slightly inward, like she wants to steal his heart away. “I still want you, Kylo.” Her answer hangs in the air. She looks up when he doesn’t reply. But he wasn’t looking at her. He was looking somewhere between them, staring at a scene unfolding that she would never be able to see. His anger is gone. There is something else in its stead. His voice sounds oddly faraway. “You asked what I meant?" She no longer needs to know, but she nods, slowly. "I have died twice. I was eight years old the first time.” Her eyes widen. She looks down as he traces his thumb along the long, diagonal slash from his shoulder to his hip. “We were on the run again. He taped it to me. Spice. He said, run, hide, don’t come out until I get you .” His head drops. “But they found me anyway.” Spice. Drugs. Kylo looks up at her again, he isn’t Kylo anymore. Someone else has possessed him. Whoever it was glares down at her with a sneering grin, and Rey feels her skin crawl. His accented drawl is cruel and mean. “ Fuck if he bleeds, rip it off him!” Rey pulls her hand from his chest. He snarls, gleefully. “Thinks he can screw Jabba over? Boy, I’ma make your daddy pay.” It’s as if there was an explosion, and he violently hacks and slashes at the air between them. Rey could feel each hateful blow, landing with murderous intent. She watches, until he tires, until whoever it was abandons Kylo. When looks at her, she is staring up at him, she is weeping for him. She takes his hand once more, kisses his palm, places his hand over her heart. It is the final straw. His grief pours out, and he doesn’t seem able to stop. They speak over each other. “I died, Rey…” “I’m so sorry, Kylo...” “…He left me for dead.” “Kylo…” “I’m so sorry, I’m broken…” “Shh, it’s ok. It’s ok…” It wasn’t ok, it might never be ok. But Rey desperately wishes it will be. She keeps whispering in his ear, an endless stream of reassurances and apologies that others should have given. Kisses him hard, anywhere that she can reach, as she climbs over him and onto his lap. He doesn’t fight as his shattered pieces are gathered beneath her. She cages his body between her thighs and in her arms. She presses herself into him, trying to wrap herself completely around him, surround him, because she wants to protect him and she wants to wick away his pain. Her poor, broken giant. She could never hold him tight enough. He soaks her shirt through with each of his shuddering, bodily cries. He repeats her name, as if it is all that tethers him. She doesn’t know how true her thought was. In his swirling grief, he is completely out of control, vulnerable, weak. But he is not afraid. He lets himself go, gives himself up. To her, to Rey. Because for the first time in a long time, he feels safe. Ironically, here. Takodana, where it all began. In a tiny apartment, in a windowless room. In the embrace of the girl he can't seem to give up. He is finally, finally safe. Chapter 28 : Whatever You Want Notes: Let's take a break and just enjoy the Reylo, ok? ;) (See the end of the chapter for more notes .) Rey quickly reaches up, rebalances the top-heavy twist in the towel wrapped around her wet hair. One minor readjustment, and all is well. She goes back to frowning. She’s tapping her nails against the opened fridge door, examining its contents. There’s half a quart of orange juice left, an opened can of root beer, some milk, leftover chili, the last tub of weird fruit yogurt that Poe bought and has been trying to palm off ever since, a carton of eggs… She knows Kylo eats like a horse. She grabs the carton of eggs, pushes the tabs and lifts the cover, catches her lower lip between her teeth. Eight eggs should be enough. She’ll just have to dip in, buy a little more to make up the difference. They won’t mind. Butter, milk and the fridge door clinks as its closed by her hip. She sets her ingredients on the bench, before bending down and pulling out a pan from the cupboard underneath. When she straightens, she hears rustling noise from her bedroom. She sets down the pan, pads carefully towards her bedroom, cracks open the door, peers in. He is still sound asleep. To be honest, she’s kinda glad. He must be exhausted, poor guy. She’s careful, tries to avoid making a sound as she steals to the side of the bed, lowers herself until she’s kneeling. She folds her hands over on the mattress, rests her chin on top. His face is screwed up tight, he’s hugging one of her pillows hard against his bare chest. He occasionally mutters in his sleep. Not words, but incoherent syllables. They had tickled last night when they danced across her skin. She’s sorely tempted to climb in with him again. But she resists, pulling the comforter back up over him, in part to keep him warm, in part to create some sort of barrier to the temptation. She does let herself lean in to give him one gentle, soft kiss to the corner of his mouth. When she draws away, she’s cursing herself. He’s waking up, nuzzling his face until its buried deeper into the pillow. One eye peeks out, half-lidded he regards her. She lets out a breath, then smiles at him. Well, he’s awake now. She might as well tuck that stray strand of soft black hair back behind his ear. She is surprised by the quickness of his hand as it darts out from under the covers and catches hers; masks a moan as he brings the back of her fingers to his lips. She thrills, trembles at the merest press. The effect this man has on her is almost disturbing. “Good morning.” “Morning,” he mumbles against her fingers, shifts slightly in the bed, lying so he can look at her properly. “I’m making breakfast, if you want to take a shower I can get you…ah…” she gasps, finds her fingers being sucked into his warm, wet mouth, his tongue licking at the sensitive skin between her digits, “…a towel…goddammit Kylo.” He is still looking at her, stopped tonguing at her frustrated tone, her fingers remain caught between his teeth. He doesn’t look like he’s trying to seduce her; he looks almost absent-minded, innocent. He talks, mouth still around her, his breath sending shivers up her spine, “I would like to shower.” Her voice still sounds a little unsteady to her own ears, “then you have to let me go.” He does, reluctantly, and only after one last, long suck, before allowing her to pull her fingers from his mouth with a pop. She feels shaky all over as she gets back up on her feet. She has to leave straight away. ==================================================== Once the bedroom door closes, Kylo pushes himself up from her bed. A muscle in his back pulls. He grimaces. Her bed is far too small and there is a dip in the middle. She needs a new mattress. If she would allow it, he would purchase one for her. Kylo feels otherwise…peaceful. Truly peaceful. A feeling different from the drained, muted grayness after his…destructive…episodes. Peace is odd thing, and he is not used to. It is quite indescribable to him. Last night’s purge, catharsis – it was pure in its ugliness. And last night was ugly. It was made bearable only by her. Rey. On the heels of that thought, Bazine. He drives that name and the accompanying doubt, the sad lesson, out . Rey is not Bazine. Rey is not Bazine. Rey is nothing like Bazine. He must search for his shirt, the one he had removed in the middle of the night. He finds it at last, tucked between the wall and the mattress. It is entirely creased. He still pulls it on, down to cover himself. He gets up off the bed, and is struck again by the tininess of her windowless room. It barely contains her bed, her desk, her dresser. Yet she makes the space, squeezing in that little shelf she has filled with objects and pictures. Mostly junk. Fragments. Bits and pieces he nonetheless bends to examine, in order to glimpse deeper into her mind. He wants to know every thread and fiber that makes her. To know her as well as she knows herself. His reverie is broken by sound. He hears a hiss-sizzle, and her sudden, triumphant exclamation breaks through the thin wall. “Damn, I’m good.” He smiles, straightens up. He will complete his examination another time. As he opens her bedroom door, he notes that the hinges require oil. Her apartment is cold, poorly insulated. Much work needs to be done. She is standing at the stove, her back turned to him. She doesn’t look away from her task as she points her spatula blindly towards one of the other two doors. Her entire apartment can be seen with one glance. “I’ve put clean clothes in the bathroom! Might be a bit small, though.” His nods, goes towards where she indicated, crosses in four paces. He casts his eye over her bathroom as he closes the door. She has left him a neat pile of clothes, a thinned, well-washed towel, and had placed it on the covered toilet seat. It is the only available flat surface. The bathroom is clean enough, although the age of the building gives everything a grimy feel. The pedestal basin - chunky, garish, spindled with fractures - is likely original. The tap shows blushes of rust. There is a brownish bloom of water damage along one corner of the ceiling. He begins to strip, slowly and carefully, ignores the discomfit he feels at being exposed in a strange place, folds his clothes, ponders where to put them. He settles for the tiled floor. The shower is still wet, the air within heavy with moisture. The grouting needs repair, there is a crack in the frosted glass door - it is being held together only by its internal wires. The pipe in the wall bangs with alarming loudness, and the water is not quite hot enough, the pressure far too weak. By the time he has finished, hair still damp from the too-small towel, dressed in a stranger’s clothes, shirt stretched tightly over his chest, he has formed his opinion. Rey deserves better, deserves more. She deserves anything and everything that is within his power to give her. And he would give her the entire galaxy. He remains in a somewhat somber mood when he exits, his clothes and the towel in his hands. He finds she already has breakfast on the table, has positively covered it with food, and is still preparing the last touches. She cranes her neck back to look at him, and smiles. It is so simple a thing… “Oh, you’re done? Sit, I’ll just be another second.” He does so, places the clothes down on an empty chair as he notes the odd, mismatched assortment of cutlery and crockery. As if scavenged together. He watches as she carefully sways towards him, two steaming mugs of coffee in her hands. He mutters his thanks as she sets it down, sits adjacent to him. “You’re welcome, sweetie,” she beams. He knows it to be a work-habit – he has heard it before in that context. But she is blushing at the innocent endearment, and then he feels his own cheeks flush. She makes him feel so much that his atrophied heart cannot quite contain it, and it strains beneath his chest. It terrified him. It is like looking into an abyss and still wanting to dive straight in. He has never felt this way before, not even when he was in love with Bazine. But perhaps that wasn’t love, perhaps this isn’t love. Whatever this was that consumes him… Her voice is gentle, low. “Kylo, you’ve got to stop looking at me like that.” He is surprised. “Like what?” Her lower lip catches briefly between her teeth when she thinks. He finds himself drawn to the sight. “Like that ,” she says, “like what you are doing right now.” “Do you not want me to look at you?” He frowns, asks, slowly. Then he is captivated by her lip and is slides from her teeth, glistening and swollen. He knows their softness against him. She blushes harder, “no…it’s just…” He notices her squeezing her thighs tightly together. He feels himself respond, heat heavy down below. It is nothing, really. She is light, and all it takes is for him to push away from the table and reach. So he does, grabs the edges of the seat of her chair, a loud screech across the floor, pulling until she is right in front of him, her knees between his splayed legs. She squeaks - an adorable sound - her face completely red. She makes him grip the seat of her chair harder. Kylo Ren does nothing by half measures, and he takes whatever he wants. He wants her. But he also wants her to want him. “I want to kiss you.” He says, simply. Her indignant coyness is intolerably attractive to him. “You could have done that without…” That is a yes. He cuts her off, kisses her enticing lips as softly, gently as he can manage. Gratitude and that…overwhelming feeling, pour out from deep within his soul. She tries to chase his lips, to deepen the kiss. Her fingers in his damp hair, on his jaw. She yields before he even asks, opens her lips to allow him entrance. He surges at the realization, he tries to hold her by her nape, only to have her pull away. He is breathless, confused, disappointed but she is only removing that ridiculous towel on her head, shaking her long hair out across her shoulders. She is perfect like this, bare-faced and without make-up, he can see each one of her freckles. He wants her even more, and it seems she has read his mind, that or she has seen the evidence. The pants she has given him, too small, do nothing to conceal his shape. “Breakfast after?” She pants, just as breathless as he. He nods, agrees. “After.” Two chairs screech backward, and she grabs him by his wrist. He cannot tell who is rushing who. Nor does he care. Notes: We've thousands of hits and hundreds of threads and kudos. I say this nearly every chapter - but thank you :) Chapter 29 : I Feel It Too Notes: More Reylo! Part 2 has been added to this chapter! As soon as they burst through her bedroom door - her pulling, him pushing – she finds herself being scooped up and almost thrown onto the bed. He comes bouncing in after, rolling over her, dark as a thundercloud, quickly, possessively, overpowering her. A part of her is exhilarated, another is a little frightened by his intensity. He’s growling above her, his hands and his mouth everywhere at once. His eyes glazed over with primitive lust. He’s nipping and sucking, for sure leaving marks. She tries but she can’t keep up. Soon, he’s literally tearing off her clothes, stripping her of her top and her bottom, marking up swathes of her skin as soon as she’s made naked, all the while reduced to repeating her name in an obsessive chant. “Rey, oh Rey. Want you, need you…” She’s trapped, a victim to pleasure, branded by love bites and stoked by ardent touches. Her body wins over, she’s wet, oh so wet, her core and her clit is pulsing with fire. She’s clawing at his shirt, tearing his hair, locks her ankles around the small of his back. He kisses and mouths at her bared breasts. His hand between them, kneading down the line from her navel to her mound. Then he’s tonguing her pebbled nipple and flicking her hard clit, his thick fingers circling and teasing her entrance. Not enough, she needs to be filled. “Kylo…fuck me…” He’s hissing and groaning, his finger push inside, then she’s screaming, whimpering, shuddering, crying towards to ceiling. Overtaken by an unexpected orgasm that rips through her flash-fire and leaves her a quivering, weeping mess. He tries to keep rubbing, but she’s trapping his hand with her thighs, stilling him with her hands. She winces with pain at the faintest brush against her battered clit, her spasming pussy. Too sensitive for even the slightest stimulation. When she finally comes down, she feels completely, gloriously limp. Her hands fall away, but he keeps cupping her sex, his kisses now nothing more than soft mouthing. She feels her throat burn from screaming, her cheeks getting sore – she must have been grinning – but the jellied thing in her head still doesn’t quite work. When she finally sees straight, she doesn’t see cocky, but rather she sees concern. It takes a moment to realize he’s still pushed against her, hot and hard. When he asks – begs really, his brows are furrowed, earnest with worry. “Tell me you aren’t done?” She shakes her head to say no. He obviously takes it as a yes. He looks so impossibly cute trying to curb his childish look of disappointment that she suddenly laughs. A feeling like champagne bubbles bursts from her heart, and she wraps him in her arms and her legs, buries her face in his neck. He oomphs in surprise as she pulls him in, but she’s so completely happy, joyous, elated and she loves him, she loves him, she loves him. Wait. No. Too fast. She doesn’t love love him. She loves having sex with him. She loves the way he makes her feel when he smiles at her. She loves the way he looks at her like he adores her, like she is the only important thing in his world. She loves that he came to her in his dark moment. But she doesn’t love him. She doesn’t really know him - she could count on one hand the things that she does. She couldn’t be in love with him, at least…she surely couldn’t be, not yet. She’s far away from reaching that point. But that thought has her tearing up. His throat vibrates against her when he speaks. “Rey?” She pulls away, looks at him, sees the alarm in his eye. She feels horny and embarrassed, vulnerable and exposed. He’s just so handsome and sexy - she doesn’t care what Finn says. He is broken inside but he cares for her, he offers his scrappy little heart to comfort her after she hurts him. He smells good, and he feels good, he feels right . He might be a stranger, but she feels like she’s known him a lifetime. “Kylo…” she begins, without even knowing what she wants to say. She has nothing to say because it’s so stupid, and girly, and absolutely nuts. She wants to love him. She wants him to love her. She wants it so much that it aches, it makes her want to run away. She suddenly starts to cry. “This makes no sense…this makes no sense…Kylo, this makes no fucking sense…” He’s got her. He has her face in his hands, thumb wiping her tears. He settles himself fully between her legs, his clothed chest pushed against her chest. She feels the beat of his heart, the heat from his cock, nudging right against her sex. He is big and warm and solid and he is all that she can sense. But he still doesn’t feel quite close enough. He lets her cry, before he silences her babbling with a passionate kiss, one that leaves her nervously hopeful and scared. He brushes his lips against her, one final peck, before pulling away. It tugs at her heart, like he’s taken away a piece of her on an invisible thread. Her forehead tingles when he presses his against her. He murmurs, eyes closed, an almost prophetic prayer. “Don’t be afraid. I feel it too.” She feels his voice rumble through the channels of her body, his words cause her to quake. Her heart, already racing, feels like it’s about to completely stop. “You do?” “I do.” She squeezes him tighter, as he starts gently rocking himself against her, giving her pleasure, causing her voice to break, “but you don’t really know me.” He didn’t like that, and he starts rocking harder as he insists, “I know you.” She doesn’t want to argue. Not about this, not right now. Not when she needs to believe him. She presses a kiss to his lips. “Rey,” he whispers, his hips slowing down, grinding harder, “do you remember what I said?” She moves with him. “What…what did you say?” He moans as he recites, recalls a vivid memory, her voice joins his at the end. “If you think anything is too much, if you think you want to put an end to this night at any point, I promise won’t stop you...” “…But I sincerely hope that you want to stay.” He’s nodding, so earnest, so serious, his voice wavering under the strain. “Ah…after this it won’t be a night, so I’m asking you again, because I don’t think…I don’t think I’ll ever be able to stop. Rey, tell me what you want. I will do anything you ever ask of me.” There is a finality to his words, a fatalist bent. She knows this is it - their last chance. And he gives her the choice. She finds she’s already decided. “Rey?” Her answer is sealed with a kiss. “Make love to me, Kylo.” He doesn’t hesitate. Not for one second. ================================================= His first kiss was a thank you, his second, third and each one after is love. He kisses her reverently, following the path from her lips to each of her freckles, the ones he had noticed not long ago before. He kisses each bruised mark he had fervently sucked into her skin. He kisses until the tracks of her tears are no more. Her hands tangled in his hair and softly caressing his neck. She gives him each part of her he asks for, accepts each one of his reverent kisses, and that is – almost - all he wants. He does not care she is not kissing him back. She is enjoying herself, taken one of his hands, brought it back down to her clit, she undulates underneath as he circles, pleasuring herself, he feels her getting even hotter, his hand becoming slick with her wet. He knows he is not huge, but he is still not easily taken, he wants to be inside her, but he does not know if she is quite ready yet. His fingers push deep, one, two then three, he holds his breath as he feels her begin to stretch. She gasps as he fingers, pulls his head to her shoulder – fast sighs then a needy, purring moan – he feels her strains pluck his body, vibrate through his cock. A bolt, hard pearled pleasure, rolls from his root to his tip. He knows that sensation, he threatens to cum. No, not without her, not yet. He digs in his knees, lifts up his hips, his hand pulls away from her sex. He desperately reaches into his pants, to pinch under his tip and squeeze. She protests with a whimper, her legs lock around him, and he has to close his eyes against sight of her begging beneath. The pain makes him hiss, and clench down his teeth, but it does its work; the urge ebbs away. A hard gasp when it is gone, and he lets himself go, sinking back down between her legs, he apologizes with kiss. He is about to give another but she gently stops him, her fingers lovingly card through his hair. Her voice, sweet and thoughtful - she actually cares - it almost undoes him again, “have you been holding for too long?” He shakes his head, even though his balls feel heavy and sore and tight. The pressure is painful, every instinct screams at him to fuck, demands him to seek his release. But he has to fight it, mustering every ounce of his will, his control. She deserves better, she deserves more. He would rip his balls from his body to please her. He says it to her as well as to himself, his tone perhaps a little petulant, betraying the conflict between his heart, body and mind. “Rey, I want to do this right.” She cups his face, finally she kisses him, he is lost for a moment in her taste. Her hand reaches down between their bodies, and he realizes her intent. One hand leaves her and he begins to remove his pants. She quickly takes over, pushing them further down his legs. He kicks off the garment, all while she grazes and grabs his dick, he moans at the contact, trembles as she guides him inside. Even the barest inch of her feels amazing to him, so hot, wet, snug. He shudders as her hand leaves him, trails back up, joining its twin around his neck, stroking the skin she can reach. Her legs are back around his waist. She smiles up at him, eyes joined as his hips push forward, guided by her heels. Pleasure licks up his cock as he penetrates her, tingles through his spine and around the base of his skull as she welcomes him in. She takes him until the root of his cock is pressed right against her soft, yielding body. He feels hot and prickly all over. He closes his eyes, his face turned towards the heavens as he relishes the feeling. At long last. He is inside her. Inside of Rey. Last time, he had not been entirely present, but this time…this time. She is so warm, so velvety, so tight – so right . She soothes something deep inside him and he feels, he knows, that if he can never visit this place again, he would rather die. He panics even from the thought. He belongs here, with her, beside her, inside of her, he is hers. He is so overwhelmed; he cannot move. “Kylo,” she’s whispering, fingers brushing hair behind his ears, and it jolts him enough to open his eyes, to meet her loving gaze, “come back to me.” If only she knew how he feels. He has always been with her. It makes him want to weep. “I’m here.” He reassures, bends down to kiss her, and she’s content for the moment to let him savor being surrounded by her. Her fingers dip beneath the wide collar of his shirt, stroking his flank where his shirt had ridden up. She is enamored with touching his skin. He presses her harder into the mattress as she skims. There is one more gift he can give her. He looks her in the eye, unsure if he wants this, but he still asks, for her, “do you want me to be completely undressed?” Her eyes widen, her breath hitches, she is nodding, smiling, then she is afraid she is too keen. Her fingers are already playing with his hem. “Do you want to be?” He will never want it. But he is honest when he answers, “only with you, yes.” The light in her eyes is worth any amount of discomfort. She is eager, pulling at his shirt, bringing it up to his chest, he helps her pull it up over his head, flinging it to the floor to join the rest of their clothes. She was immediately all over him, running her hands up and down his chest, his back, over his sides, his ass. She laughs with delight, pulling him down, pushing her breasts into his chest. He was still reeling from the sheerness and smoothness of her skin. She catches him by surprise when she starts rocking herself on to his dick. She smirks, the minx, playful and sexy, the bumps inside her create friction that licks up his cock and he spirals with pleasure, overloaded with sensation, his mindless hips begin fucking her back. Wet, sucking sounds fill his ears. Her smirk transforms into a long, needy, 'O'. He slides inside like she is butter, on each pull away her pussy clenches to drag him back in. He is addicted to the feeling, and keeps seeking her cunt, thrusting again and again. He shifts their position, pulling one of her legs from his waist, and pushing it out to side. She follows his direction, lets him angle her hips, until she begs him to aim his cock there. He knows that he has her, and he is back on her clit, rubbing it out of time with his cock. Her legs spread wider and she moans while she quivers, he presses the advantage and plumbs deeper into her sex. It is messy, inelegant and perfect. No composure, no façades, this is them, at their most basic selves. He forgets everything else but the beautiful woman wrapped around him. He grabs her face, desperate for her to look at him as he says it, his finger is sucked into her mouth. "I love you, I love you..." She bites and she stutters as he fucks her, her sentence comes out incomplete, “Ooh, Kylo…” She screams. She has lost all control, her eyes roll backwards, her sex soaks him as she scratches at him, bites him, spasms and clenches his cock, every ridge inside of her is evident to him. Her body bucking, shaking, and arching beneath him enough to throw off his rhythm. He has already built to his peak. He feels his first knot of cum. Everything appears in sharp focus. He shouts as he explodes. He pushes himself in as deep as he can as his taut body finally gives out. His mind goes blank and he is a creature of pure sensation, euphoric, floating and free. His cock jerks as it throbs with each thick searing rope. He helpless thrusts in, until he is spent and has yielded up every last drop. He can’t catch his breath, his balls ache and feel pleasantly light and loose, his softening cock sore and beaten around. When he comes back down from his high, he is exhausted. Her cunt still squeezes him weakly, and he winces, gripping her hips. He is too sensitive; he has to pull out. He gasps as his soft cock hits the mattress, raw, slick and still red. He feels his seed slide out after him. The air cools him and soothes like a balm. The urge to couple is finally sated. God, he loves her. He feels sleepy and tired. He nuzzles at her pillowy breasts. He has enough presence of mind to roll off her, to pull at her until she lies tucked against his chest. He snuggles her affectionately, lazily kisses at the back of her neck. His lips trail off slowly as he finally succumbs. He is blissed, loved and wanted. At last Kylo Ren can rest. Chapter 30 : Have a Good Day At Work, Sweetie Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) The world came back knocking in the rudest way. Well, it did not so much knock as it rang. Rey had to struggle out from under Kylo’s heavy arm, which he kept wrapped tight around her middle. She gives him a couple of playful slaps, before he finally lets her go, and she scrambles to get to her phone. She blinks at the time, it’s 10:35, she blushes to think they had burned through most of the morning. She still feels every minute of it. She silences the phone with a swipe, her eyes dart to check on the massive man who simply sniffled, and then fallen back asleep. The wind-ruffled voice blares from her phone. “…hell-lo, Pea-nut? You there?” She quickly brings it to her ear, and hurries out of her bedroom. The nip of cold reminds her she’s naked, oh god, she is naked, on the phone with her best friend. She shudders, covers herself as if that would help. “Hellooo? I can hear you breathing! You’re starting to freak me out…” “I’m here, Finn.” She whispers, maybe a little harshly. “Thank god! I thought something was…why are you whispering?” “How’s your road-trip going so far?” She cuts in. It’s a lie by omission, and she already feels guilty. She worries her lip as she hugs her body. She hears a distinctive humph in the background. Poe. “Great! We’re just filling up on gas right now. Poe says we’ll get there sometime after seven tonight.” She just makes out Poe’s voice, grumbling something about being late and the bladder of a six-year-old. Finn’s laugh hurts her ears, oozes affection as he says, “he’s getting more anxious the closer we get.” “Shouldn’t you be getting anxious?” Rey teases, eyeing the breakfast she had prepared. She dips her finger into her mug of coffee. Cold. Finn snorts, “Peanut, everybody loves me,” she can hear him wink through the phone, “I mean, you love me, right?” She laughs and admits, “yes, I love you. Will you call me later, when you get to Yavin?” “Yes, I will. And maybe again later if I suffer a mental-breakdown and need moral support. You know, because I’m so anxious.” Rey hears Poe chuckling. She’s smiling too. “Alright, Finn. I’ll talk to you tonight. Bye!” “Ok, bye, Peanut!” The last bit comes out rushed, “oh, and if Maz’s making it this year – save me a piece of pie!” She shakes her head as the phone goes silent. She hears the floorboards creak behind her, and Kylo has filled her bedroom door. He has already put on some clothes. She goes up to kiss him, but he pulls away. “Who was that?” He asks, gently, flinched as if ready to be hurt. She reaches up, scratches softly at the beard growing on his chin. She could feel tenderness everywhere his beard had scraped her. “My friend and also my roommate, Finn. You’re wearing his clothes right now.” Kylo nods, looking down to the floor. “You said you love him.” She sighs, traces her finger down the middle of his chest. She wonders if he’ll always be this fragile. “I do. As a friend. He’s gay.” Her giant is too big to look like a kicked puppy, but he somehow still pulls it off. Her heart melts as she pulls his arms around her. She cuddles up into his warmth. He speaks into her hair. “I meant it, Rey.” She hums as she nods into his strong chest. “I know. I mean it too.” “Good.” He replies, simply, “…you are naked.” She smiles, looks up at him, nudging his chest with her chin. “I am. What do you want to do about it?” She sees his throat working, his mind begins ticking, evil thoughts dance in his eyes. But then he lets out a frustrated sigh, bends down to kiss her forehead. “I want to fuck you. But I have a meeting this afternoon.” She feels as she looks, crestfallen. He wasn’t done speaking yet. “Will you see me again, tonight?” She nods, “I won’t finish my shift until late.” “When?” “I’m not sure…ten or ten-thirty? We always do a big clean-up before Thanksgiving…come by when you finish? You can have dinner at the diner.” “I want to take you somewhere.” She waggles her eyebrows, then rises on her tiptoes to kiss his jaw, bribes him saying, “I’ll save you some sweet potato pie?” He concedes, but she has a feeling it was only after he had mulled the idea over in his head, independent of her tempting offer. “Only if you will come home with me, tonight.” She pretends to be offended, pulls away slightly, but still within his warm embrace. “What’s wrong with my place?” He lets go of her briefly, she leans sideways and watches him touch his lower back. She somehow finds it funny, though he is unamused. He still accepts her kiss. She is back in his arms when she agrees, happily. “Alright, old man.” She then cocks her head towards the living room. “Now let me through, I need to put on some clothes.” ================================================= Breakfast, long cold, was nonetheless eaten. She watched as he ate, in his slow and methodic way, fascinated as he steadily puts away almost all of the food. He remains mostly silent as he chews, occasionally meeting her stares with one of his small smiles. His hand remains underneath the table, squeezing and rubbing her knee. He helps with dishes – she has him scrubbing the pan. She steals glances at him as he works, intensely focused on getting out each spot. There is a quiet domesticity to seeing him like this, in Finn’s worn old shirt, looking kinda messy, doing something so mundane. He looks completely different from the well-put-together businessman she had first laid her eyes on. A warm feeling in her heart grows. Hope. Maybe this could work, maybe there is something to this. The pan he hands back looks shiny and new. When he really does have to go, his hair is still tangled, his lips swollen, his cheeks glowing. He’s obviously been thoroughly well-fucked. She can’t help the little swell of pride at the sight. Her giant. This time, she was entirely responsible for him looking so disheveled. He looks at her a little quizzically, then finally shrugs. He kissed her again at the top of the stairs, just outside her apartment. He lingers before he turns to go. She’s already missing him. She couldn’t resist living out a little bit of her new fantasy. “Have a good day at work, sweetie!” He stops, nearly half-way down the stairs. He turns to look back up to her, making her weak at the knees. He doesn’t quite join in her roleplay, but she still likes his farewell. She feels it tingle up to her ears. He is as cute and as earnest as the day she first met him. “I love you, Rey. I will see you tonight.” Yes, she thinks grinning after him, this definitely might work. Notes: I hope you enjoyed that. :) I've already tacked on Part 2 on chapter 29. Feel free to re-read it if you like. Chapter 31 : Stability. Order. Safety. Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) Ben Kenobi had almost lived his entire life in just one little corner of the Republic. As a much younger man, he served abroad. But he left his commission for the love of his life, Satine who was so lovely, and returned with her to this place - unsophisticated, backwards, built directly on the ancient bones of the earth - atop exposed hills of wind-sheared red rock. It was parched and sun-beaten, blasted each summer by howling haboob, and pelted by monsoonal rains. It was blessed with beauty, in the months when the desert flowers broke colors against the red, in the hushed silence of night under a canopy of brilliant stars, the mornings the sun cast its shadow over the aged hills. Niima Outpost, an ignorable place, on the edge of a great, wide desert, far out in the Western Reaches. His hometown was still half in this century and half in the last, most of its roads still graded from gravel and dirt. The houses were small, modest and plain. Built long ago by strong, honest men with square hands, dirty faces and iron dust latched in their lungs. It was a place of earthy pride, of neighbors bonded by the harshness and isolation of their desert home, the toughness of their work, pulling ore from deep within the ground. It was, despite everything, a happy place. But time changes everything. Those days were long gone. Niima Outpost was just one of many. When the mines, then the metal works closed down, the jobs dried up. All that was left now was the scrapyard. A new industry, darker and deadlier, came to fill the void. Niima Outpost was no longer happy. Those who could; they simply left. Those who stayed were doomed to slowly languish. With each passing year, the seedy and the dirty grew, becoming a permanent stain. It sprang behind closed doors of the uncared-for houses; the ones with dried shrubs, and chipping paint and broken windows. The poor, the dreamless and the demented drifted in and out, flitting like chaff and dandelion seeds on puffs of directionless wind. They lost themselves to cheap liquor and the suddenly plentiful spice, having waited too long for a miracle to come. This is Niima Outpost now. A scrapyard. A spice den. A scrap heap. The Republic’s dumping ground for unwanted people, for unwanted cars and their parts. Ben Kenobi lived through it all. He might just be a simple man, but he was not blind to what had happened and to what was happening still, just as he was not blind to what was going to come. It was only a matter of time before the embarrassment of Niima Outpost became a problem. One to be solved by the stroke of a pen, by a man far away who had never seen what Niima Outpost was and could be. Left and right, the old houses were torn down. It was an inglorious end to a once proud town. It was finally happening to him. It came in the form a towering young man with soulless eyes, piercing and full of black. Even in the summer heat, he wore his jacket and tie. Ben Kenobi, now old and dying, could sense this young man was already dead. He introduced himself Kylo Ren. Ben got them some ice water, and young Ren helped; surely out of expediency rather than kindness. As they sat out on the porch, young Ren reached within his black brief case, and pulled out a thick, black folder. With a dramatic flair, pale hands dancing, one by one, young Ren sets out his papers. When he is finished, the table is covered. Young Ren gestures to the spread of the personal records he had somehow obtained. As Ben Kenobi glances over this sad summary of his life, young Ren quietly watches and waits. His voice was deep, it could almost be comforting, except he spoke without any feeling at all. “You recognize these records as your own, do you not, Mr Kenobi?” Ben was once a fighter. Now, he is too tired, so he just nods. With his fingers steepled beneath his chin, young Ren leans back in Satine’s wicker chair. “When you go soon, you will leave nothing behind. Your debts will erase all of your estate.” He pauses for effect, before he continues. “I am told you have a grandchild. That you have raised her since birth. Alone. Is this correct?” There is no answer, nothing to say. The young man already knows everything, it appears. Young Ren narrows his eyes, begins to pack up the papers. “If your house is reclaimed by the county government, you will receive the fair market price. If you sell to First Order Property Investments, you will receive the same amount.” He clasps shut his briefcase and sets it back on the floor. “One will take longer than the other. But reclaim or sell, the outcome of both is the same for me. For you, it is a different matter.” With that, young Ren picks up one glass of ice water, and proceeds to drain it dry. He rattles the cubes, sets it down, reaches within his breast pocket. “If you choose to sell, there is something I can do for you. I can give you the power to provide for your grandchild after you die.” With slight hesitation, an envelope is placed onto the table. “This, Mr Kenobi, is a…personal gift. I would appreciate if you do not share it around. If you do, then the offer is automatically rescinded, because I will no longer be positioned to help you.” Young Ren rests his empty glass on top. “You have forty-eight hours to consider.” He stands to leave. “Have a good afternoon, Mr Kenobi.” ================================================= Ben doesn’t dwell too long on young Ren. His offer lies ignored. Ben finds these days his mind is foggy and it wanders, retracing old paths, well worn. He has heard that when the end nears, one cannot help but take stock. On good days, the good memories outnumber the bad. His first memory was a good one. He works on their house, stops digging fence posts, taking a moment to mop at his brow. He sees his Satine, so young and vibrant, charming the dry, friable earth to yield. Their toddling wild-haired daughter plays in the dirt beside her, so spirited and free. Satine told him she wanted a house full of children. Their daughter would be the first and the only one. His baby girl thought Niima Outpost made up all of the world; her desire to roam hadn’t yet awakened. His little adventurer, always in a rush, always wanting to go. "Baby girl! You have to hold onto mommy. Mommy doesn't want you to get lost!" He remembers the terror, watching Satine praying on her knees, refusing his comfort as she gets up and paced the floor. Their baby girl had disappeared into the desert. Couldn’t she see he was afraid, too? He remembers the joy when his daughter – the miracle child - emerges, and falls into her mother’s arms. He couldn’t be angry; he was so very thankful. His wandering daughter, unconcerned, had come to no harm. He remembers Satine, on the night that she died. A sudden illness. She was too young. “Protect our girl.” He remembers the fights with his daughter. The loud yelling matches. He had tried hard keep his promise, and couldn’t see he was pushing her away. One last fight before she walked out the door. (“There’s a whole other world out there, dad! And I’m going to see it. I’m not going to die here in Niima Outpost!”) He found himself left alone. She came home years later, older and roughened, with her hands protecting her belly. It was a stormy night, she was wet and bedraggled, her tatty suitcase lying on its side on the porch. She had nowhere else to go, but to come home. (“Dad, can I stay?”) She was in love with her baby, even before it was born. He came to love it too. She was fixing up dinner when she suddenly called out to him, “Dad, I’m going to name my baby Rey.” He had nodded, smiled up at her from the kitchen table. “Is that right? And if she’s a girl?” “Still going to call her Rey.” His daughter was only back home for a few months when she unexpectedly left once more. He had held baby Rey as he watched his dear daughter be lowered into the ground. She would lie in his grave, the one he had bought next to Satine, many years before. He was soon to join them, even though he doesn’t want to leave. Even though he still misses them both. ================================================= The sun is much lower in the sky. His eyes widen and glisten when he sees her. His baby girl, climbing the steps up the rickety porch. Ever the adventurer. He has not seen her in so long. Does she know he missed her? His thin voice is filled with wonder and awe. “You came back.” She looks confused as she smiles. “Poppy?” No, this is not his daughter. The past and present run so close together these days, he sometimes cannot tell them apart. He still smiles at Rey fondly from his old wicker chair. She drops her backpack onto the porch and sits in Satine’s chair, looking at the table between them. The two tall glasses of melted ice water were still left out. The unopened envelope unmoved beneath one. “Did you have a visitor today, Poppy?” He nods, when he suddenly remembers young Ren. “Yes. But no one you need to be concerned about.” She picks up the glass, picks up the envelope. He sees it is slightly wet. She turns it over in her hands. A logo flashes, a black sun within a hexagon, beneath it: Stability. Order. Safety. Ben may be old, dying, forgetful. But he must protect her. From whatever may come next. He gently takes the envelope from Rey’s grasp. ================================================= It is late into the night when a shooting pain deep in his gut wakes him up. He sits on the edge of his bed and takes deep breaths. It is called a breakthrough pain. He gets them often now. The doctor said it was normal. The crickets are still chirping. He switches on his lamp. His gaze falls onto the photos he always keeps by his bedside. All of his girls, his own little family. Three generations of Kenobis he had been blessed to be able to love and care for. His job is not done. He slowly pulls on his robe – nowadays he is always cold – too quickly and the pain is too much. He pushes up from the bed, unsteady at first. He reaches for his walking stick. With ginger steps he leaves his bedroom, and makes his way down the short hall. Her light is still on. Studious Rey, she has fallen asleep over her school books again. He switches off her light, lets her sleep on. He isn’t strong enough to carry her and tuck her into bed anymore. She is only fifteen. She is still so young. As he slowly continues, he enters their living room. He is flooded by memories triggered by the pictures on the walls. His entire life had played out within this house. Happy, sad, sweet and bitter, he has experienced it all. He had wanted to leave it to Rey, a lasting connection, to a past she never got the chance to know. The pain flares again, he almost doubles over. He knows he is running out of time. Young Ren’s letter is in his pocket. He picks up the handset of the telephone. It is very late. He still calls. An overworked voice answers in a resonant rumble. “Kylo Ren.” “Mr Ren. This is Ben Kenobi.” He looks up, to the fading photo that hangs in front of him. His wedding day. His lovely Satine. He smiles. He knows he will be joining her soon. “I have decided that I will sell.” “…I will send over the paperwork tomorrow.” The phone line beeps, the call has ended. It was done. When he meets his final end, he will go in peace, knowing Rey will be provided for. Notes: Sorry for the delay!
