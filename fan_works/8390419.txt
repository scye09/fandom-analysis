“my <3 stops 4 u, my pants drop 4 u.” - myspace.com/xXxBeAuTyToRnApArTxXx Message discovered in bathroom stall, written on inside of door in magenta Sharpie. I don’t know what a “myspace” is. I will return to this. Addendum: MySpace is a social media website. The above poem was penned by “Kylo Ren.” I recognize him. He goes to my school and his real name is Ben Solo. I will create a profile. USERNAME: ControlledBleeding PASSWORD: cb99372 - I have created a folder for all of Kylo’s photos on my computer. Below is a contact sheet of what I have collected so far. - Kylo’s face is oddly proportioned. I am becoming fixated on his eyes. They are brown. I would look “less scary” if I had brown eyes. Can you make contact lenses out of someone else’s irises? Addendum: You cannot. - As of today, Kylo has sent me (4) nudes. I have not looked at them. He is clearly not bothered when I call him a “whore” or “slut.” - I think I'm getting sick. - STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP ST - Crack the body Hollow the shell Nothing will grow - I had a dream that Kylo let me inside. I held his lungs and kissed him. I feel very strange. - I had sex tonight at a party and imagined my “partner” was Kylo. It was better this way.
