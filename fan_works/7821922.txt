~~ Open scene ~~ Fade in on a green island in an ocean of blue. Zoom in on two figures standing on the island, facing each other. Absolutely no time has passed since the end of episode VII. Zilch. Nothing. Picking up right where we left off. Rey, wearing her nifty new vest with matching arm wraps that she picked up at the D'Qar Nordstrom Rack (70% off!), stands before the mysterious and venerable Jedi master, offering the very lightsaber with which she had defeated and scarred Kylo Ren, returning it to its rightful owner. Her hazel eyes are filled with yearning. Luke Skywalker lowers the hood of his homespun Jedi robe, his piercing blue eyes filled with a wistful sadness, deeper than the ocean that surrounds them. Luke speaks. "So. You must be Rey. Sorry about dumping you on Jakku all those years ago. That place must have sucked. But you're here now, so it looks like everything turned out all right in the end. No hard feelings? I guess you met my nephew, then. Moody bastard, ain't he?" ~~ End scene ~~
