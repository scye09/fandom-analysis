Kylo was standing in front of him, wearing what he had himself described as “halloween fashion”. The outfit consisted of a simple black shirt, a black, gothic-style trenchcoat and a pair of black stockings with a white spider web pattern on them. Hux couldn’t help but laugh. “What?” Kylo said. “Doesn’t this look good on me?” “Yes, yes, it does, but…” Hux interrupted himself, laughing even more. “You’re wearing stockings, Ren.” Hux found this simultaneously cute, hot and hilarious. Kylo, though, looked like he had no idea why Hux was laughing at him. “So what?” “You never wear stockings.” “There’s always a first time!” “Yeah, yeah, sure. You’re cute.” Kylo blushed. “Stop it.” “No, really. You’re always cute.” Kylo was quiet for a few seconds before quietly saying “You too”.
