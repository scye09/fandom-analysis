– “They killed her, uncle! THEY KILLED HER!!! ” His rage oozes and crackles around them like a terrible miasma even as he struggles to lift his head. A sheen of fever on his death-pale skin, his eyes a sickening yellow. * “Revenge is not the Jedi way, Ben.” There is a bitter cadence. A terrifying gentleness. (“What is the Jedi way, Uncle Luke?”) In the saber’s soft glow Rey transcends serenity, her long braids moving in the unearthly wind. * (“Mercy, Ben. Justice.”) When the azure blade pierces his heart, there is a hint of a smile. An understanding. And for the first time in years (for the last time ever) Luke sees his sister’s warm brown eyes. “Peace,” he whispers the final lesson. – Notes: Dedicated to Carrie Frances Fisher.
