The first is in bedroom and almost in bottom (On sheets unregulation, the finest white cotton) The General he kisses and croons and he sighs But the Resistance has sent him two lovely new spies. The second is morning-time before breakfast caf (His Knight in a good mood, a rare, full-voiced laugh) Kisses go southernly, thinking it’s time There’s no way mass genocide should ever be rhyme. The third time is scheduled, ‘don’t disturb me now’ The candles burn low, the food is space cow Feelings are mentioned, and looks are exchanged The evacuation of stomachs on the damn chef is blamed. Fourth time lucky, says no one, but Kylo and Hux A quickie, a handjob, it’s time for the sucks Clothing pushed to the side, what a man, what a catch …at least he was one before Millicent did scratch. Five occasions with no love, now both have blue balls Please have some compassion, we’re climbing the walls Kylo evacuates the room, gives the cat a vacation He doesn’t care if it’s a moon or really space station. His General agrees it is their time for fun And if anyone intrudes he’ll shoot ‘em into a sun.
