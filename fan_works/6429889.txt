Memories of Takodana MEMORIES OF TAKODANA Author: Kylo Ren, Master of the Knights of Ren Esq I recall the day I met you… You'd been stalking me a lot! You were trying desperately to shoot me… And I couldn't land a kriffing shot! I used the Force to still you… Then you perved me up and down! You were the girl I’d heard so much about… And I’d heard you were a black-robed clown! I Forgot the droid... I had what I needed… Frozen, I couldn't hide! Should have followed Snoke’s orders… Instead you carried me off like a Bride! On my shuttle I did take you… after waving you to sleep… I bet you touched me up! Uh Yes… I did… You kriffing CREEP! Mwahahahahaha! Chapter 2 : Report to my Regiment Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .) REPORT TO MY REGIMENT Author: Captain Phasma Polish that helmet! Shine those boots! Stand to attention dear boys! Submit all blasters … for my inspection I want to see your toys! On my command You'll meet my demand! Want to live another day? Then just DO AS I SAY! All my men in white… Such a glorious sight! My regiment… is now your home You’ll moan in delight As you die for me Your wicked Queen in chrome Notes: I feel like Phasma is a 'Galadriel' type of leader to her men. "All shall love her and despair." Chapter 3 : The Lord Vader's Prayer Notes: (See the end of the chapter for notes .)
