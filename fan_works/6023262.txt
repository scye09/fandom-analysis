Poe found his General sitting by Finn's side, and holding his hand, lost in thought. He quietly sat down on the other side and took Finn's other hand. He wasn't even certain she knew he was there until she spoke. "I asked Han to bring our son home, and never realized he had brought a son back to me until..." she stopped and took a breath, blinking rapidly, "until a daughter brought home that son." Poe reached over Finn and caught General Organa’s free hand “Ma’am, you should know half this base is one slip away from calling you ‘Mom.’”
