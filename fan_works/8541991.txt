mother, you were born to be a queen. you trod the galaxy beneath your feet; you shed your royal blood to save the world in all its wretchedness. what are you now? the princess of pain, the queen of cosmic rubble: your subjects blasted back into the very stardust from which their bones were forged. i learned from you that heads lie heavier without their crowns. i learned from you that the dead will never go away. i learned from you about families of blood and choice. i learned from you about the hardest choices. mother, you were meant to be the mother to millions. i never could have been enough for you and so i set out to become too much to bear. i’m sorry, mother. i’m sorry, and i love you but your son is going supernova; i will burn my way across the sky and then i will be gone. i will be as Alderaan. i will be as ashes. maybe then i will be something you can cradle in your hands. maybe then i will be something you can understand. maybe then i will (finally) be something you can love.
