Poe leaned back in his chair, watching Ben slurp his way through a pudding cup. The pilot smiled, leaning forward to smile. Ben stopped, sucking on his spoon, staring at “What? Why are you staring? You know I hate that.” Poe reached out and his finger flicked over Ben’s mouth. Poe removed a smudge of pudding from the corner of Ben’s mouth and sucked it off his finger. Ben blushed and smiled softly, leaning in. Poe pressed their lips together gently. And then nicked a spoonful of Ben’s pudding, much to the younger man’s scowling.
