Introduction "Hello everybody and welcome to Skywalker Sisters . This will be my fourth fanfic in the process following Secrets of the Force , Legends and The Skywalker Siblings . I am very excited to write this one. For a while now, I've toyed with the idea of Rey having a twin sister that may have been taken to the dark side with Kylo. I really hope you're excited for this one. As with all my fanfics, it's gonna take time, but it will be here. Trust me. Anyway, thank you very much and be on the lookout for the first chapter coming soon!" - Alex Oswell, creator of Skywalker Sisters .
