Rey smelled him before she saw him. Pungent. Salty. Greasy. Like a wet dog. His left side curled up against the communal recycling bin of her apartment complex. Huddled underneath a drowned, flatten cardboard box that acted as protection against the wet clouds. While only his backside was presented to her she could see that his makeshift umbrella was useless. Everything was damp. Soaked. Doused. Hmm . She stalked closer. One. Two. Three steps. Then he was within arm’s length. She crouched down, behind him, until the front of her thighs touched her chest. The ends of his hair curled, touching his neck, just grazing the top of his sweater. Black hair. Black sweater. Her right arm unwrapped itself from around her legs and lifted away and towards him. Close. Closer. There. The tips of her four fingers grazed the only bit of skin that wasn’t covered in black. His neck was cold. He made a whining noise from the back of his throat. She dropped her stretched arm and wrapped it back around her legs. His breaths were heavy and short. She shuffled, still in her crouched position, until she faced his right side. His head was drooped towards his chest, shoulders hunched, arms wrapped around his torso, and his hands fisted into his sweater. He cocooned himself. Tensed. The tip of his nose was visible from this angle. It was shiny from the rain. She reached out again. This time, only her pointer finger made contact with the side of his nose. He exhaled through his nose. Loudly. She ignored it. Her hand uncoiled until another finger. Two. Three. Four fingers in total stretched out. She used them to flutter over his closed eyelids. Then used her whole hand to cup his cheek. Cold. Slippery. Clammy. Her thumb swept away the liquid tracks that the rain left behind. Like she was wiping away tears. He panted. Turned his head to make sure that every bit of her hand was in contact with his face. Pushed into her hand. He moaned. A corner of his lip twitched, just barely. He was just like Ol’ Ren, the Afghan Hound that her grandfather had kept as a companion when she was a child and had still lived in England. The stranger’s long, silk-like black hair clumped just like Ol’ Ren’s coat did after his monthly baths. The stranger whined just like how Ol’ Ren whined the first time she petted the top of his head. That rainy day when her grandfather first introduced her to the puppy he had found in a waterlogged cardboard box. The puppy had slept on her lap that same night, curled into himself. Fell asleep while she brushed his coat. Until it shined. She stared. Once. Twice. Three seconds. Removed her hand from his cheek, he whined again, and moved both hands under his armpits. He felt broad, solid under her palms. Looked well fed. Cared for. He must have had a home. Somewhere. Come on, now. Up. She tried to lift him up. He pawed at her sternum, weakly. She tried again. This time he made the motion to swipe her face. Missed. She shifted until her lips hovered over his right ear. "Let’s get you warmed up. Then we’ll get you back home," she whispered to him. He responded by placing his chin on her shoulder. Allowed it rest there. She pushed with her knees. He cooperated by following after her. The cardboard box fell to the ground, barely making a sound. His shield left forgotten on the ground. She shifted, navigated, and nudged his body around hers until she acted as a human crutch. They swayed. She steadied them. He was tall in height even to her above average stature. She prodded his side, pushed, supported them to the rear entrance of her apartment complex. They climbed. One. Two. Three flights. Unit 304. It proved to be difficult to hold him up while she unlocked the door, and shoved them in. In her tiny but warm apartment, and their sides pressed against each other, she realized that they were both soaked thoroughly. She guided them to the floor until his back rested against the wall next to her front door. Removed both their shoes. He wore black socks. Stood up, stepped back, and retreated to her bedroom. Changed out of her drenched clothes and into a grey sweater with her school’s crest in the front and some fleece-lined leggings. Ventured into her bathroom to run a white towel through her damp hair. She decided that it was better to leave her hair in its usual three-bun style. Then grabbed one of her grandfather’s old sweaters and the towel she just used (it was her only towel). Her mind tugged at her until she grabbed her hairbrush as a last minute thought before returning to the stranger. He shook and shivered. But he looked better. She squatted until she was at eye level to him. She reached for the bottom hem of his sweater. He swatted at her forearm. He whined, again. Please, Ren, you’ll catch your death if you stay in this. He exhaled, loudly, dropped his arms to his sides. She quickly pulled the sweater off his body, unbuttoned his button-up, and peeled off the undershirt. It fell into a pile of black fabric beside them. Then tugged the fresh, dry grey sweater over his body. He dwarfed the sweater, the sleeves too short and shoulders tight. The tops of his trousers were relatively dry, thanks to his curled position earlier. But it wouldn’t do. She reached for his belt. Hesitated. Glanced at his face. His eyes were still shut. She hadn’t seen his eyes once yet. Were they also black like the rest of him? She closed her eyes. For modesty. Her hands methodically removed his belt and his damp trousers. It joined the pool of black beside them. When she opened her eyes she almost laughed when she realized that his boxer-briefs were black also. Almost. She grabbed the towel, patted him dry. Attempted to squeeze the rain out of his hair. He signed with contentment. Tossed the towel to the same pile and reached for the hairbrush. With her hands, one holding with the brush and one free, she placed her hands under his armpits again. He used his palms to push back behind him and against the wall to help steady his rise. With their chests inches apart from each other she guided him closer to her couch. One. Two. Three steps. He was now standing with his own two feet. She removed all contact. He opened his eyes. They’re brown, almost black. Shiny just like how Ol’ Ren’s were . She almost laughed. Almost. She still missed the dog that died years ago. So she sat down first, up against the arm of the couch, her left hand, gripped with the brush, resting on the top of it. With her other hand she patted the seat cushion to the right of her. He stared at the cushion. Or was it her hand. She stilled. One. Two. Three moments passed. He made that whining noise again, the one that came so easily to him. Then immediately climbed onto her three-seater couch so that his head rested on her lap, face towards her stomach, arms curled to his chest, legs bent, and feet pressed against the other arm of the couch. He placed the hand, her hand that was just patting the cushion seconds ago, onto the top of his shoulder. The shoulder that pointed to the ceiling and sky above. She kept her body rigid and her arms stiff beside her. Paused. He continued to stare blankly at her stomach. Then he made an irritable noise. Dug his nose until it pressed slightly into the fabric of her sweater. He inhaled, deeply. Quietly. He then moved the hand that was on his shoulder again to rest on the side of his head. The bottom of her wrist skimmed the top of his ear. He used his much larger hand to guide her fingers through his hair. She felt a tug in her head again. And then. Oh. She understood. He wanted to be brushed. Brushed like how Ol’ Ren loved to be brushed. Brushed until it shined. He dropped his hand back against his chest. With her one hand still raked through his hair, she brushed the back of his head with her hairbrush. He made a choked moan-like noise. Then hummed. Her body relaxed almost involuntarily. After a moment, so did his. After every inch of his scalp was brushed thoroughly she paused. She studied him now that most of his hair was brushed away from his face. His long face was decorated with sporadic moles. His brow bone sharp. His nose sculpted and prominent. His breathing had slowed and steadied. Content. He must have fallen asleep, she concluded. She felt sleepy herself. Like how her legs were asleep under his head. Between the couch and his head. Like she was trapped. Her heart picked up. Her mind cleared. She hated feeling imprisoned. Shifted. Tried to move. But he burrowed his nose deeper into her sweater-clad stomach until she could feel the tip of her nose pressed against her bellybutton. Her mind felt clouded again. She willed herself to calm down. Inhale. Exhale. Repeat. He slipped one of his hands around her back so that it was wedged between the front of the couch and her back. It moved in lazy semi-circles, trying to soothe her. But now her torso was trapped between his nose and right palm. She didn’t move. She couldn’t move. Shit. Shit. Shit. This had to be payback for when she touched his neck, nose, eyelids, cheek outside. Had to be. Suddenly, he growled in his sleep. Actually growled. Like how Ol’ Ren growled when she didn’t understand him. But this stranger isn’t Ol’ Ren. She couldn't keep him like how she kept Ol’ Ren. Fed him. Cared for him. Allowed him sleep at the foot of her bed to protect her from the monsters. No, she couldn’t. People aren’t pets. He needs to leave. Now. But then, immediately, her mind hazed over. More intensely this time. Heavy. Lethargic. The only thing that made sense to her was to do was to focus on the one thing she could do. So she continued to brush his hair. Until it shined. But in the morning, you go. She thought to herself. Oh, but she could keep him, she contemplated. Did she? Yes. But he would have to promise to behave. To be good. To be obedient. I’ll be a good Ren. I promise, Rey. Chapter 2 Notes: The italics are meant to be slightly confusing (no clarification of whose thoughts they belong to) because #inappropriateuseoftheforce. Ha. Rey woke up with her body up against the arm of the couch. Legs tucked and knees up, they touched her chest. One arm draped around her shins. The other cupped her cheek, numbed. She lifted her eyes and looked straight. Saw black. One. Two. Three blinks. Wrong. Not black. But the night. Some light filtered in from her windows. Her eyes adjusted until she could see the ugly, peeling wallpaper on the wall across. But last time she was awake it was mid-afternoon. She forgot something. Someone. Cold. All black. Hairy. The last thing she did before falling asleep was- Oh. She looked down the length of the couch. Empty. Turned her neck straight again. There. Below her line of sight. Tilted her head down. Farther. Onto the floor in front of the couch. Body turned toward her. His head tilted downward. She could only saw his crown. His backside blanketed by the worn, shaggy black throw blanket she had tossed off earlier this morning. Or yesterday, now. His long legs crossed, elbows placed on the seat cushion where her body was curled. On either side of her bowed up body. His upper body caged her in. She couldn’t move without making contact. With him. He hummed. Then moved one of the walls of her cage, his right hand, and wrapped it around her ankles so that both were gathered. Pushed together in his hand and confined. Bound by his palm, fingers, and thumb. Squeezed. Because he could. His forefinger twitched against the outside of one of her ankles. Against the sliver of flesh not covered. He groaned. Gratified. Pleased. Kriffing weirdo. He grunted. Like he took offense. Instead he took action. Pushed the finger that had twitched and moved it up. Pass her ankle. Slipped it under the cuff of her leggings. Until that finger was fully covered by fabric while the rest of his hand rested against and around the top of her ankle. She remained stagnant until her legs lost sensation. Numbed from trying to keep still. Then her stomach grumbled. She had also forgotten to eat dinner. Again. He moved. Took his arms off and away from her. Straightened his back and rolled his shoulders until the blanket fell off. Reached for her again. Both hands, this time. Each one fisted an ankle of hers. Traced her achilles tendon first before he pulled. Pulled until the arches of her feet each cuddled the dip where his hipbones slopped into thighs. She was dragged forward. Until only her bottom was entirely on the couch seat. She leaned back. Pressed her upper back against the solid front of the couch. Grounded her hands into the seat cushion. Used them to steady her. He ran his hands up her calves. Slowly. Then down. With purpose. Fingers massaged and knead the skin and muscle beneath. Until she gained feeling again. Until he was sure she could stand on her own two feet. But just in case. He scouted back until he touched the side of her savaged coffee table. Away from the couch. Released her legs and stood up tall and straight. But tilted his head. She never left his sight. She blinked. Once. Twice. Three times. Then, bent at the waist, he wrapped each of his hands under her armpits. Up. She almost laughed. Almost. She braced herself against his shoulders. Rose up. Up. Until her eyes were inches away from the collar of her grandfather’s old grey sweater. The collar she ran her fingers along whenever she wore it. She almost did again. She dropped her arms back down to her sides instead. Left some room for him to remove his hands from under her armpits. He didn’t. She continued to stare at his collar. So she raised her hands up towards his. She wanted his hands off of her. But he was faster. He turned 90 degrees to his right. Spun her around too. Her back almost touched his chest. So he lowered his hands until they curled around her waist. His thumbs pressed into her back, palms nestled, fingers dug into her front. Once. Twice. Three seconds passed. He was close enough that she heard him sigh quietly. His breath tickled the top of her head. He inhaled. She exhaled. Repeat. He prodded her right heel with the tip of his right foot. Did it again. Again. She stepped forward with her right foot. He repeated his actions but with her left heel. She stepped again. Again. And again. Until they stood at the threshold of her tiny kitchen. She reached with her right hand for the light switch on the wall. But his right hand left her waist and followed her outstretched hand. His hand grabbed hers. He whined. Fine. She pulled her hand out of his and rested it on the countertop instead. She felt his hand return to her waist. Right. Okay. Ol’ Ren could see a lot better than humans could in dim light. She thought about the time she almost tripped over him when the tried to grab herself a glass of water at night but he moved, danced, around with ease at night. Skilled. But that was a while ago. Years. Her stomach growled again. Wanted attention. Needed attention. So she stepped into her kitchen. He released her waist from his greedy paws. She reached for her almost empty box of cereal. The only food she had left in her apartment. She ran out of milk two days ago. So she walked back. Back to the room that was her living and dining room. Back to her couch. The one that was probably older than her. Back to her coffee table. The first piece of furniture she had picked after she aged out of the system. Back to where he stood in the space between her couch and her table. She could just make out his eyes. They reflected the bit of light that came in through her windows. Through the night. She hesitated. He looked bigger now that she could see all of him. Broader. Wider. More solid. Like a creature. Even if he looked sort of funny in his too small grey sweater. And boxer-briefs and socks that did look ridiculous in his current state. So she took a step back. He took a step forward. She took another and so did he. Again. Until her bottom tapped against her stove, left hand tightened around the cereal box, and her right hand reaching behind her. Looking for a weapon. Anything. Please. He crouched down. Towards the floor. The tops of his thighs pressed up against his chest. His arms wrapped around this bent legs. Her hand paused. Eyes followed. He cocooned within himself. Tried to make him small. Smaller. Like a harmless puppy. Whined again. There. That tug again. Her mind hummed. Body relaxed. Like Ren. He reminded her so much of when Ol’ Ren was a puppy. His shiny black hair. Nervous nature. She wanted to gather him up and nestle him into her chest. So that her chin would rest on the top of his head. Could still fit in her arms. Her mind pulsed. Oh, she wanted to do exactly that. No. She needed to. So she walked back. Confident. Towards the stranger. One hand still held the cereal box. Right foot in front of the left. Left foot in front of the right. Repeat. Then she stood within arm’s length of him. He watched her like a predator would watch his prey. Primitive, almost. No. He observed her with awe. With his head lifted and his mouth parted. Barely. He unravelled his arms from around his legs. Dropped to his knees. Softly. Reached up. Up. Until his hands found home on her waist again. Then pushed up and forward until the side of his face was flushed against her stomach. Like how Ol’ Ren would stand on his hind legs and greet her (every day) with his snout pressed into her stomach, eyes shining, barking. Her small welcoming party. She almost laughed. Almost. The stranger moved both hands towards her back. Pulled her into his caress. Hungry. Starved. Her stomach thundered this time. He paused his fondling of her mid-section. He exhaled through his nose, audibly. Irritable little puppy. Always needed the attention to be on him. But no. So he pushed her toward the couch. She let herself fall softly backwards. She, for the second time today, was back on the couch while he caged her in. Annoyance flared within her. But he recognized that. And fixed it. Remedied it. Just like how Ol’ Ren knew when to make her laugh. How to turn her frown into a smile. Let her just hold him when she needed an anchor. She still missed the dog that died years ago. The stranger took away the cereal box that she’d held onto as if her life depended on it. He placed it on the table behind him. Then rose from his kneed position. Just a bit. Enough. Manipulated and contorted his body until his body joined hers on the couch. The left side of his upper body curled onto her chest. His bottom cushioned by her thighs. His legs bent at the knee and toes pushed into the dip where the middle seat cushion ended and the third seat cushion started. His knees relaxed against the couch’s back cushions. His left hip dug into her stomach. His left shoulder touched the couch, in the space between her right ear and shoulder. He was too tall for her to rest her chin on the top of his head. But his nose pressed into her right temple. He inhaled. Hummed. Exhaled. She felt it dance across her cheekbone. Close. Just like how Ren used to relax on her lap. Perfect. He seized her hands and wrapped them around his torso. So that one of her palms rested against his stomach and the other rested on top of that. When she attempted to uncoil her arms he snatched her wrists and made her fist the bottom hem of his sweater. Her hands could not move again. Would not move again. He made sure of that. Placed his left hand to cover both of hers. Then he raised his other arm and extended up. To cuddle the side of her neck. His palm warmed her. His fingers burrowed themselves into the bottom of her scalp. Twisted them into her hair. Pulled a little. Just because he could. His thumb rested on the front of her throat so he could feel each nervous swallow she took. He stared at her face. One. Two. Three moments passed. Her stomach howled. She would have been embarrassed if it wasn’t something she had become accustomed to. But he wasn’t. He reluctantly drew his hand from around her neck and stretched. Reached towards the table. Groped for the cereal box blindly. His eyes never left her face. Then. The box was in front of him. Opened it. Snatched up the cereal bag up and tossed the box. Somewhere. There was maybe a cup left in the bag. But it would do. Laid the open bag on his stomach, above the huddle that became their hands. She couldn’t reach. So he stimulated. For her. Always for her. He fisted a handful of the cereal. Brought it up to her face. She looked at his closed fist. She blinked. Once. Twice. Three times. He uncurled his hand, slowly. She continued to stare. He whined. Eat. Her mind screamed at her. She wanted to eat. Yes. Needed to eat. So she ate. Once the handful was consumed. He fisted another. Brought it back up to her mouth. His hand uncurled but cupped. She continued to eat. He continued to stare. But he wanted more. So he uncurled his other hand from around her fists. Brought her hand up. Used his much larger hand to guide her fingers through his hair. She felt a tug in her head. Again. So she combed through his hair as she feasted out of his hand. Until. The tip of her tongue accidently brushed, skimmed the dip where his palm, forefinger, and middle finger met, to reach the last crumbs. He groaned. Her stomach squeezed and turned. From hunger? Of what? She stilled. Paused. Confused. Her legs were asleep again. Panic. She was trapped between the couch and him again. Again. Again. How did she get here? He whined. Irritated. Then she felt something. It gently brushed against her right temple. More physical than mental this time. His tongue swept up from underneath her cheekbone to the corner of her eyebrow. She froze. Then laughed. Laughed until her body trembled and quivered. So he did it again. Licked the entire length of her cheek. Then the side of her nose. His breaths chilled the wet tracks that his tongue left behind. She peeked at him from the corners of her eyes. Shocked to see his eyes bright. Excited. He enjoyed this. Was ecstatic that she cradled him on her lap. Content that she petted him and brushed him. Satisfied that she laughed when he licked her face. They paused. One. Two. Three seconds passed. But she felt sleepy. Now full from cereal and exhausted from laughing. He hummed. She shifted. Towards her bedroom. He whined. Like a spoiled little Ren. TUG. She would have to sleep here again. With Ren in her lap. Yes. She continued her ministrations through his hair. He wiped the hand that held the cereal across her sternum. Before fisting a corner of her sweater into his own hand. Bad, Ren. He will have to be trained. How to care for himself. How to be good. Good enough to keep. To stay. Her eyes drooped. Her arms grew heavy. Could no longer comb through his hair with her fingers. He signed. Moved her hands back to the bottom hem of his sweater. Made her fist the sweater. To anchored her. His hands then surrounded hers. Like a cage. Maybe a protective wall. Yes. That’s better. A protective wall. But she couldn’t take in a stray. No. She barely made last month’s rent and tuition only increased every term. Her jobs, scholarships, grant were stretched already. Pulled. Thinned. She couldn’t. He squeezed her hands. He hummed. She’ll find a way. She always did. He tucked his nose deep into the side of her face. Deeper into her hair. Until he was almost buried beneath her hair and skin. His hair tickled her cheek, nose. But Ol’ Ren’s long coat was so beautiful she could never give him a haircut. Never. Just brushed his hair. Until it shined. Go to sleep. Dream. So she did. Inhale. Exhale. Repeat. I’ll be your Ren. Good Ol’ Ren. So you’ll never be alone again. I promise. Please keep me. Let me stay, Rey. Chapter 3 He nearly fell off the couch when she stirred. Jumped off the couch. Stepped over him. He growled. Ignored. She stumbled towards her bedroom (only bedroom in this tiny apartment). Door left open. He watched her. Sat on the couch, alone, and watched. She moved. Twisted. Danced. Until. Her hands reached for the waist of her warm leggings. And yanked. Down. He turned his head. Averted his eyes. Closed his eyes. For modesty. Exhaled through his nose. Exhaled, hard. “Shit, it’s 9 o'clock,” she whispered to no one. But his ears perked up. He turned his head back towards her bedroom. Though she no longer stood near the doorway. One. Two. Three seconds passed. No sound came from the bedroom. Was she okay? Hurt? Did she need his help? He worried. He almost left his warm nest. Almost. Instead he stretched his mind. Reached out to brush hers. But then she ran out of the bedroom. Same sweater, no leggings, but faded jeans instead. Carried a grey backpack. It looked heavy. Full. Turned an immediate left. Pulled that door open. A bathroom, he noted. Those were the only three doors in her tiny apartment. Front door. Bedroom. Bathroom. She jerked the hand that griped the doorknob. It gave. To close behind her. It clicked shut. No. He moved off the couch. Crossed over to her in one. Two. Three steps. Until his forehead touched the shut door. Left hand on the door handle (the one she had just touched). His right hand, fingers spread, palm rested on the door. He glared ahead. As if the door wasn’t there. As if he was looking into her eyes. He whined. Open. Open up. Please. Open. Open. Open. His hands shook. Rattled the doorknob. He pressed his ear to the door. He heard her move. Not enough. He needed more. He needed in. Couldn’t be apart from her. Needed to see her. “Give me a second.” So he did. Another. And another. Jiggled the handle again. Again. She pulled open the door. He almost fell in. Almost. She steadied him. Her hand braced his sweater-clad shoulder. It was warm. Too small. They both stood tall. He stared at her. She glared at him. Peeved. But there she was. She released her hand off his body. Ran it through some loose pieces of hair at the nape of her neck. Her three-buns. He craved to do the same. He reached out. To touch her. Wanted to. Like last night. She stepped back. Into the bathroom. Away from him. He hesitated. Arm still strung out. Her eyes huge. Mouth tensed. He looked too big. Too broad. Wide. Intimidating. Like a monster. Even if he looked sort of funny in his too small grey sweater. And boxer-briefs and socks that looked ridiculous in his current state. So he hunched. Cocooned. Small. Smaller. There. Until he had to look up at her. From his knees. She blinked. Once. Twice. Three times. Inhaled. “Look, you can’t stay. I don’t know you.” He whined. “Stop that.” He wailed. “No. Ren, listen to me! You will listen to me.” He hummed. His eyes glazed over. She had nearly choked on her next breath. Mistake. Not Ren. No. “I can’t keep you. You know I can’t. You have a home, somewhere. A family-” He whined. Whined. Whined. Like his life depended on it (it did). “Stop that! I’m already late. Stop whining. I said stop.” Neither moved. Neither dared to move. One. Two. Three minutes passed. “Fine! You can stay here. Only for a couple of days. Do you hear me, Ren? Only a couple of days.” He hummed. She huffed. Frustrated. But she turned her back to him. Pushed her feet into her beaten up sneakers. No jacket. Walked towards the front door. Squinted at the pile of black fabric next to her feet. Stared hard. He shuffled over to her. Still on his knees. Behind her. His eyes bore holes into the small of her back. Reached with his left to touch the inside of her left wrist. Warm. Her arm stilled. Then. She snatched it away. Gripped the doorknob. Twisted. Pushed. Right foot in front of the left. Left foot joined her right. “Be a good boy. Don’t make a mess. Okay? I’ll be back tonight.” Then she slammed the door behind her. He hated doors. Hated them. But he was allowed to stay. He rose up from his knees. Stood to his full stature. Tall. He shivered. The nest no longer warmed by her. Him. Them. So he walked towards her bathroom. Tiny, like the rest of her apartment. He thumbed the bristles of her toothbrush. Damp from use. By her. So he grabbed it. Took the toothpaste with his other hand. Squeezed too much onto the bristles. But. Brushed his teeth. Rinsed his mouth. Swirled with her mouthwash. Spat that out. He stared at his reflection in the mirror. His hair shined. Used the fingernails of his right hand to gently scrape along his scalp. He hummed. Then turned to step back and out of the bathroom. He was cold and hungry. Quivered. Hunger could wait. Glimpsed at the black shaggy blanket tossed onto the couch. Her couch. His. Theirs. So he wrapped the throw around his shoulders. Tied two corners together at the base of his neck. A shield. Yes. From the cold that seeped into his bones, long ago. And never left. Burrowed into him. Stayed. Until now. He found his home. He inhaled, deeply. Her. One. Two. Three seconds passed. So he gathered his clothes. Cold. Slippery. Clammy. Tapped his wallet. Keys. All there. Good. Slid his sock-clad feet into his black dress shoes. Damp. Manageable. And reached for the front door handle. It felt warm. Warmed by her. Possibly. Always her. Opened the door. Stepped out into the hallway. Shaggy blanket, black boxer-briefs, and damp shoes. Closed her door behind him. He exhaled. He founded the communal laundry with ease. He always had a keen sense of direction. So he loaded up a washer. Used two loose quarters from his wallet to pay for it. He waited. The cycle finished. He transferred it into one of the dryers. Another two quarters gone. Used. He waited. The cycled finished. Pulled out his clothes. Touched them. Prodded them. Not as soft. Scratchy. Oops. Dry clean only. He didn’t care. Untied the blanket around his shoulders. Tossed it to the ground. Almost threw her grandfather’s old grey sweater to the ground. Hesitated. No. He folded it and placed it at the top of the dryer. Then reached and tugged his undershirt, on buttoned his button up, pulled his sweater over his body. Stepped into his pants. Dragged them up. Belted it. Fully dressed. Ready. So he gathered the tossed blanket and folded up sweater. And walked. One. Two. Three flights of stairs. Until. Shit. The door’s locked. Idiot. He jiggled it again. Nothing. Rattled it. Nothing. Almost started to pound on the door. Almost. An old lady peered at him with beady eyes. Passed him slowly. Gave him a suspicious look. He looked down. His ears burned. Oh, they burned. Frustrated. He wanted back in. Needed in. Craved their couch. Their nest. Refuge. Hideaway. So he waited. Back against her wall. Leaned up against it. An hour passed. So he crouched down. Down. Until his bottom rested on the floor. His bent legs pressed to his chest. He waited. Another hour. Another. Again. And again. Restless. So he fisted his right hand and punched. Punched the ground next to him. Slapped his own thigh. Pummelled it. Scratched at his forearms. No. Inhale. Exhale. Repeat. He needed to be good. Good enough to keep. A good boy. If he was good she would give him a treat. Maybe brush his hair. Until it shined. Maybe even wash it for him. Yes. She would shampoo his hair. Brush it until it shined. Then would him let burrow around her. Into her. She would pet him and whisper into his ear. All praises. He shuddered. Yes. So he climbed to his feet. Held tightly the blanket and sweater. And walked. Down. Down. Down. Until he breathed the morning air. He needed a walk. So he walked. He walked until he left her neighbourhood. Crossed town. Until he stood in front of his residence of dwelling. It was a hotel. So he climbed up to the lobby. Right foot in front of the left. Left foot in front of the right. Repeat. He stopped. Faced the receptionist. “Good Afternoon, Mr.-” “Hello,” he interrupted. His voice rough from not using it for days. And he made a sharp right. Past the elevators. To the stairs. Healthy diet and exercise prolonged life. His life with her (he hoped). So he climbed again. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight flights of stairs. He breathed through his mouth. Needed more oxygen. Closed his eyes. Focused on his breathing. Inhale. Exhale. Repeat. Then continued. He occupied the space in front of his apartment (hotel) door. He spied the DO NOT DISTURB sign that he had left there since the first day he moved in. Fumbled for his key pass that was tossed haphazardly into his wallet. Found it. Pressed it above the handle. Beep . Green. He gripped and turned. The lights turned on by themselves. Stalked right in. And promptly ignored the legal papers scattered on the floor. Shredded copies of a non-disclosure agreement he had signed years ago. More than a decade ago. Jobless. Torn up reminds of an obituary for a woman he used to call home. Motherless. His mess. Hurricane. Tornado. All because of him. His anger. His lack of control. But no. He was a good boy now. A good Ren. Good Ol’ Ren. If she would allow. He threw the blanket and sweater onto his bed. The only thing close to being organized in the room. Since he rarely slept in it. Or slept at all. Walked over to his bathroom. Didn’t bother to close the door behind him. Just started to peel the layers off of him. To create another pile of black fabric. Just like how she did. Oh. He already missed her. Missed their home. Angry that he locked himself out of their nest. So he marched to the glass shower. Under the rain head nozzle. And turned on the water. Ice cold. Lukewarm. Hot. Too hot. Cold. Perfect. He ignored the hotel-provided amenities. And scrubbed with his nails. Scratched. Purged himself of anything that wasn’t her. Wasn’t him. Wasn’t them. He scrubbed at his head. Immediately recoiled. She had brushed his hair. Until it shined. He felt something bubble in his chest. His shoulders taut. He ruined her work. All her hard work. He slammed his eyes shut. Tried to remember the sensation of her finger combing through his hair. The brush that massaged his scalp. He tried. Oh, he really tried. So he clamped his scalp with his hands and just pushed. Attacked it. Shoved it. Until the bubble burst and he could only tremble. He wished he could cry. Cry big fat tears. So her thumb could sweep away the liquid tracks that they left behind. But he couldn’t. Haven’t been able to cry for years. So he whimpered instead. He whined. His own fingers grazed the back of his neck, nose, eyelids, cheek. Tried to imagine that it was her touching him again. It didn’t work. So he scratched himself. He cried out. He tucked his hands under his armpits. Imagined it was her whispering: Up. But his hands were too large. Too much him. Not enough her. So he crushed himself until he was sure he would bruise. And he tried again. Once more. Carded all of his fingers through his wet hair. Tried to follow the paths that her fingers took. The ones she had spoiled him with. But nothing. So he fisted and yanked. His scalped screamed. Protested. He had ripped some hair out. Ripped out more. More. Until. Shit. Shit. Shit. Ren had the nicest long, silk-like black coat. How could he be a good Ren if he even didn’t look like Ren? So he paused. Stilled. One. Two. Three seconds passed. Inhaled. Exhaled. Repeat. He felt less fury. More irritation. He didn’t need to recreate her ministrations. Not when she allowed him to stay. Maybe she’ll look down at him. Down into his immense, dewy eyes. Let him bury his chin into the soft panes of her stomach. He’ll convince her to treat him. Award him. Maybe brush his hair. Until it shined. Maybe even wash it for him. Yes. She would shampoo his hair. Brush it until it shined. Then would him let burrow around her. Into her. She would pet him and whisper into his ear. All praises. His body shuddered. Yes. He twisted the shower off. Extended his arm for a towel. He chose the largest one. He had many. And patted himself dry. Ruffled through his hair with another towel. Tossed the spent towels behind him. Exited the shower. Exited the bathroom. Entered his bedroom. He was comfortable nude. Never ashamed. Relaxed even. But he knew he had to get back to her. To their nest. Before she did. She would scowl him for running away. Escaped. If she got home before him. So he hurried. Another pair of black boxer-briefs. Black socks. Black V-neck t-shirt. No button up. A black crewneck. Black jeans. Black belt. Black sneakers. He reached for his wallet. Picked out his credit card and room key pass. Everything else was irrelevant. Tossed his wallet back onto his bed. Bundled her blanket and her grandfather’s old grey sweater to his chest with one arm. The other pocketed the two cards. He eyed the cellphone on his bedside table. Left untouched for over three days. He blinked. Once. Twice. Three times. Turned around. Advanced onwards. Opened the door. Stepped out into the hallway. Closed the door behind him. He exhaled. Marched back to the stairwell. Down. Down. Down. Down. Down. Down. Down. Down. Down. Passed the elevators. Passed the reception desk. Passed the glass doors. He walked. Away. Beyond. Off. Until her apartment building came into view. Until he waited to shuffle into the building with a delivery driver. Until her front door was in front of him again. He lightly touched his forehead to her door. It was warm to the touch. Quiet. She had not returned yet. Brushed his lips against the door. He hummed. Pleased. So he turned around. Back against the door. And slid down. Crouched down. Down until his bottom touched the floor. Bent his long legs and pressed the tops of thighs to his chest. Tucked in his knees. Placed her blanket and her grandfather’s old grey sweater under his chin. Trapped between his knees and chin. Wrapped his arms around his shins. And waited. Waited for her. Closed his eyes. Smiled into his knees. He hummed. He awoke to something touching the crown of his head. Ruffled it. Petted it. Her. He opened his eyes. Peered up. Up to her face. She caressed his hair and scalp. She looked tired. Drained. He knew it was night again. His body vibrated. Her hand paused. He willed his thoughts to spread out. To her. Then she calmed. Perfect. She smiled at him. Slow. Blissed out. So she extended both hands on the tops of his knees. Flung her blanket and her grandfather’s old grey sweater to the side. Pulled them away from his upper body. Just a bit. Enough. To move her arms under his armpits. Up. His heart thundered. He followed her. Up. Up. Until she had to look up at him. He did not like it. She deserved a pedestal. Him, her servant. She wiggled the doorknob. Turned her key. Click. The door cracked open. He stared at her face. She peered into dark void that was her apartment. Theirs. Then he captured her arms. From under his armpits. Nudged them until they were hand-in-hand. His hand dwarfed hers. But he felt protected. He hummed. He motioned them inside. Slowly opened the door. More. Wider. All the way. She kicked the blanket and sweater inside. He pulled them into their apartment. Shut the door closed. All the way. It was just them again. So he stooped down. To his knees. Hands still interlaced. Pressed his nose to her stomach. Breathed in. But she smelled different. Too different. Not her. Not him. Not them. He hated that. And nudged the bottom hem of sweater up. He paused. Waited for her response. One. Two. Three moments passed. She allowed him. So he pushed it higher. Up until was held up by his forehead. Where it gathered just under the curve of her breasts. Her stomach bare. For him. So he took. Oh, how much he took. He pressed into her soft, comfortable stomach with the side of his face. He inhaled, deliberately. See, Rey. I’ve been good all day. I didn’t make a mess. See? Please, Rey. I deserve a treat. A reward. She hummed.
