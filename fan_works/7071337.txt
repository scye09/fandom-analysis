“How did you manage to live like this for so long?” Techie shrugged his shoulders, forced to keep his head raised as Mitaka continued to use a cotton swab to clean the rust from the corner of his eye.

Mitaka frowned at the answer but accepted it. “I’m going to clean the lids now, okay?” “...Okay...” Techie reached back, holding onto Phasma’s wrists. He winced when Mitaka carefully pulled one of his eyelids forward, squirting a cleaning solution underneath to flush out the rust that had started to build up. “Ngh...” “Does it feel better when it’s finished?” Phasma asked. “Yes.” “Then you can tolerate this discomfort,” she said with a small smile. “It’ll make you stronger.” “Typical Stormtrooper logic,” he muttered but he smiled anyway, feeling much better as Mitaka finished one eye and then moved to the other.
