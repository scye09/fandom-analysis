Once a little girl, Grown up a lost young woman; Not alone for long. Long ago, you remembered, But now you are just waiting... Adventure awaits! Tell yourself: I can do this. This is the Falcon? Forward: A dangerous path. But too late, you can’t go back. Jedi honor code: Legacy uncontested. The only right path. One you love, gone forever; Vengeance raging in the night. A pull to the Dark, Promising all desires. Listen to the Force. Voices speaking across time, Of direction and promise. Seeking a teacher, Know your true path lies ahead: A little less lost. Bringing balance to the Force, By walking the line between. Notes: A/N — This poem is structure like a Renga poem (except it’s not collaborative). Renga poems are structured in a repetitive haiku / couplet format. So the first stanza is three lines, with the first line having 5 syllables, the second having 7, and the third containing 5 again. The second stanza is two lines with 7 syllables each. Then it repeats until the end of the poem. Let me know what you think! I love feedback and constructive criticism!
