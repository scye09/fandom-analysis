“Do you love me?” The room was dark, soft light pouring in through the viewport. The pair laid together in bed, Hux’s hand running through Ren’s hair in an absent minded gesture. The Knight’s head laid on his chest, his arms wrapped around his waist. Not ten minutes ago he’d been letting out the most lewd noises, but now he was quiet; they both were. “Yes.” “Mm, I know.” Hux looked out towards the viewport, strangely calm. “That’s the thing about you, you’re always full of something. Anger, loyalty, love, it pours out of you. It’s quite breath-taking, actually.” He didn’t have to look at Kylo to know he was confused. He could feel it. But dutifully, Ren kept quiet, knowing better than to interrupt. It almost made him smile, knowing he’d been able to tame such a man. “Sometimes I wonder how you manage to contain it, all those emotions.” They were stationed around a nebula. On record, they were located here because it was closest to their supply pick up. Hux had just wanted to see the stars. “How do you do it? I’m jealous, I suppose. I always wonder what it’s like to feel that much. To feel love.” Kylo shifted and looked up, at long last. His eyes were so soft and open, so trusting and loving. Oh, it made Hux ache. “But you do love. You love me.” Ren started, reaching for Hux’s hand so he could bring it to his lips, press a kiss to his knuckles. “What you feel for me, that’s love.” “No,” Hux smiled, cruel and so very, very sad, “it’s not.” Notes: he's just scared kylo, give him time, he'll get there of course by then it'll be too late, and ren will have grown to hate him. and hux will realise just what he lost out on as always you can find me at skywalkeraesthetics
