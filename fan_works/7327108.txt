I Always Need A Pilot “I told you once already. I need a pilot.” Finn didn’t wait for a response, moving forward in the cramped space. Pressing Poe up against the wall as he claimed his lips. A storage unit, between assignments, it always reminded Finn of their first meeting. As usual, no resistance. An exploration instead as Poe kissed Finn back, hands running up to his jacket and pulling him closer. Finn moaned appreciatively and Poe started to chuckle, breaking the kiss. “You say that so often.” He grinned before pulling Finn back to him and kissing him hungrily.
