“Look!” I grabbed his shoulders, “Look at me dammit!” He looked up. “I love you, okay? I’m not leaving. I’m not going. Hell, I can barely get you out of my head, how could I get you out of my life?” I laugh to myself. “I love you. I don’t care who you were before all of this, I love who you are now. I love you!” I yelled, “I love you Finn! I am in love with Finn!” People turned to look over, Finn smiled. “I really fucking love you. I have to go, okay?” I kissed him. There was so much passion, love, wanting; it was hard to pull away. ** I didn’t want him to go. He stopped kissing me, but I couldn’t let him go. I started kissing down his neck. “..I really- ..I really have to- ..Finn..” I stopped. “Yeah, yeah..” He kissed me one last time and started jogging to his X-Wing. He turned towards me, still jogging. “I love you,” he yelled, making a heart with his fingers. He turned back around nearly tripping over a small supply kit.
