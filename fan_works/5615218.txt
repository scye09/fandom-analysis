Rey punches Kylo in the face hard Everyone cheers Yikes! Kylo shouts as he falls to the ground 5 of the stormtroopers rush in to save his fucking ass Everyone wants Kylo dead Violently, BB-8 attempts to smash Kylo Even the stormtroopers don’t cry for Kylo Really unsurprisingly they fail to save him Kicked in the balls and everywhere else You only live once, cries Rey as she picks up a lightsaber Lightsabers and blasters fly into Kylo’s face Oh no, Kylo sobs as blood runs from his eyes Frightened yet, Kylo? Rey yells Unless you have something up your sleeve you’re finished Cool, Finn supplies Kylo begs for mercy as everyone has harmed his fragile butterfly soul Internal bleeding and screaming; he must suffer Never again will Kylo Ren be shipped with Rey Great scott! Han solo is back from the dead Slaps his face because that was why he came back Usurper, Poe says demonically Crucifixion, everyone satanically cheers Kylo Ren cries for the final time. Shut up, says Rey.
