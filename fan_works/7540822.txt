Finn entered the hanger bay one afternoon hoping to find Poe or Rey working on their ships. Instead, he was met with a curious sight: a gaggle of astromech droids wandering around the hanger seemingly at random. He noticed they were looking at something on the ground and approached them to see what it was. After reaching the back of the group, he noticed a red speck on the ground that was moving of its own volition. Was it some kind of bug? Finn couldn’t get a closer look and was reduced to following the pack of droids around. At that point, cackling broke out from above him and Finn looked up to see Rey sitting in the rafters, holding a small device in her hand. “What are you doing up there,” he called. “The laser pointer makes me their god,” was her reply. “The what now,” Finn asked. “The laser pointer,” Rey clarified as she floated down from the ceiling. “What’s a laser pointer,” Finn asked. “This,” Rey responded as she pointed it his chest. Finn immediately looked down at himself then back at Rey’s hand. “I wasn’t sure the droids would figure it out, but I thought for sure a human would,” Rey said. “We didn’t have anything like that in the First Order,” Finn told her, “where’d you get it anyway?” “I stole it from the conference room this morning,” Rey replied. “You should probably put it back,” Finn said. “Probably.”
