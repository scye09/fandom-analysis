Too Soon Tomorrow's coming too soon, she can't stand it. She has to survive, but she just wants him, her Han, her husband. She misses his touch. Chapter 2 : Slippery "Kate... you okay?" Suzannah can't hide her slight laughter, even as she helps her friend up. "Ice... is not friendly." "At least it wasn't me?" Chapter 3 : Approval She seeks their approval desperately, finding her home in their kindness. She is quick to mirror it back, loving them platonically, truly and deeply. Chapter 4 : History "It's endless arguing..." The girl smiles as she looks up at Kate, then glances at Suzannah before adding. "I'll keep fighting for your happiness anyway..." Chapter 5 : Blood Pledge "Who will pledge their safety...?" "I." The girl's hair glitters even as she accepts the knife, the ceremony started the second she slices skin and bleeds. Chapter 6 : Hopeful "I pledge thee hope... Kate." The girl raises the glass of blood and wine to Kate's lips, praying for hope, for them both... them all. ------------------------------------------------------------------- "I pledge thee hope... Suzannah." Again the glass is raised, the girl's eyes locked tight on her friend. She will fight to save them all. ------------------------------------------------------------------- "I pledge thee hope... Tracy." Third glass, third drink and she is weakened. She fights on alone. Binding them all to her, for their lives. ------------------------------------------------------------------- "I pledge thee hope... Amanda." She is weak now, struggling to raise the glass. Amanda drinks at last, then draws her close. She can rest. ------------------------------------------------------------------ She wakes later, tucked safely in the back of a car, sheltered by her bonded girls. They are her hope, for a future that shines.
