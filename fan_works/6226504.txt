“Achoo!” says Poe. “Oh, Sith-spawn. I have a cold.” “You should go to bed,” says General Leia. “I will bring you chicken soup.” “What is chicken soup?” asks Rey. “I have never had it.” “It is good for colds,” says General Leia. “You can have some too.” * “I do not feel well,” says Poe. “Achoo!” “Maybe you should meditate,” says Rey. “That might make you feel better.” “I will try it,” says Poe. He sits on his bed and closes his eyes. “Achoo! I do not think I can meditate while I am sick.” “I am sorry,” says Rey. “I will try to think of something else.” * “I have brought you some tissues,” says C-3PO. “Please do not sneeze on me. I have just been polished.” “Thank you,” says Poe. He blows his nose. “I do not like being sick.” “I am glad droids do not get sick,” says C-3PO. “Beep beep bloop !” says BB-8. “What did he say?” Finn asks. “He says Poe should not have gone out in the snow without his heavy coat,” Rey says. “That is not very helpful,” says Poe. He blows his nose again. * “Maybe we could spar,” Finn says. “That might make you feel better.” “I am too sick and sore to spar,” says Poe. “Oh,” says Finn. “I am sorry. I will try to think of something else.” * “I have brought you tea,” says Jessika. “It will make you feel better.” “Thank you,” says Poe. He drinks the tea. “This tea does not taste good.” “I did not say it would taste good,” says Jessika. “You are a cruel woman and a good friend,” says Poe. * “We are sorry,” say Rey and Finn. “We do not know what to do to help you.” “You can come and snuggle with me,” says Poe. “Will that make you feel better?” asks Rey. “Having you here helps the most,” says Poe. Rey and Finn snuggle with Poe all night. * “I feel much better!” says Poe. “My cold has gone away.” “That is very good!” says Rey. “I am very glad!” says Finn. “What would you like to do today?” asks Poe. “Achoo!” says Rey. “Achoo!” says Finn. “Oh no! You have gotten my cold. I will bring you chicken soup and tea and tissues,” says Poe. “Thank you,” say Rey and Finn. “Then will you snuggle with us?” “I will snuggle with you all day, buddies,” says Poe. “Achoo!” say Rey and Finn.
