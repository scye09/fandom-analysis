He can’t look him in the eye when he’s like this. “So… did you know, they call me the Protocol Droid?” the pilot asks. Kylo peeks out. “No. And they don’t.” “ Babe .” “ Fine .

Babe?” Kylo licks the hand on his mouth until it moves. “Okay… another one. Did it hurt?” “When?” “When you Fell from the Light Side into my bed?” “POE!” “Okay, okay! I got it this time…” Kylo hopes to fuck he does. “Man, are you the Death Star? Because I wanna make a run on your exhaust— HEY!” Kylo kisses Poe fiercely to shut him the hell up. Well. The lines kind of worked… “Never do this again,” he insists. “Not ever.” “…keep kissing me and I might remember.” Series this work belongs to: ← Previous Work Part 70 of the The Pilot and his Knight series Next Work →
