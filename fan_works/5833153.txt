One day on the deck, Captain Phasma and Bree were discussing military tactics to destroy the rebels. They were just getting to the invasion part when Phasma was called to the control room. Bree told her when she was finished she could find her in the training room. Bree went to the training room and started a fighting simulation. She was defeating all the enemy bots. An hour passed by and phasma came to the training room. She saw how hard Bree was working and decided to help her out. They both fought side by side and conquered them simulation. The entire time, bree was getting a force feeling from Phasma. It was strange. It had a protective feel to it. She ignored it though. You are very skilled said phasma. Who is training you? Kylo ren. Phasma had an upset expression but bree couldn't see it because of her helmet. Kylo ren huh...interesting. Phasma I need to ask you something. Do you have any children?
